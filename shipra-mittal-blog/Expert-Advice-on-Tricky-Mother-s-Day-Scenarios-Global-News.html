    <h2><i>Story: When Mother’s Day Isn’t Easy</i></h2>
    <p>Mother’s Day can be a difficult holiday for many people, for a variety of reasons. For some, it’s a reminder of a difficult relationship with their own mother. For others, it’s a painful day if they’ve lost their mother. And for others, it can be a struggle when they don’t have a supportive partner or co-parent to help their child or children celebrate them. Whatever the reason, Mother’s Day can be a complex and emotional occasion.</p>

    <h2><i>Real Life Examples</i></h2>
    <p>One mother shared her experience of navigating Mother’s Day while dealing with postpartum depression. She found the holiday overwhelming and felt like she couldn’t live up to the expectations of being a “perfect mom,” but with help from her partner and support network, she was able to find ways to make the day meaningful for herself and her family.</p>
    <p>Another mother shared her story of having to spend Mother’s Day apart from her children due to a shared custody agreement. She struggled with feeling like she was missing out on an important occasion, but found comfort in creating her own Mother’s Day celebration on a different day.</p>
    <p>Yet another mother shared her experience of having a strained relationship with her own mother, and feeling like Mother’s Day was a holiday she couldn’t fully participate in. With the help of therapy and self-reflection, she was able to find ways to honor herself and her own motherhood on Mother’s Day.</p>
