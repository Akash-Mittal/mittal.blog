    <p>When Jessica was a child, her parents constantly emphasized the importance of academic achievement. They pushed her to the limit, signed her up for multiple extracurricular activities, and punished her for anything less than perfect grades.

    <p>Jessica's story is just one of many shared by members of an online group that discussed the parenting mistakes that can have long-lasting negative effects on a child's life. Based on their collective experiences and insights, we've compiled a list of 37 common mistakes, categorized by the stages of a child's development:</p>
