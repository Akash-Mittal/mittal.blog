    <p>As soon as a woman becomes a mother, she is bombarded with unsolicited advice, opinions, and expectations about how to mother her child. Many new moms feel the pressure to follow a prescribed set of rules and guidelines that are supposed to ensure the perfect upbringing for their little ones.</p>
    <p>But parenting influencer Zahra Jani strongly believes that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to motherhood. Jani, who is the founder of Motherly Way on Instagram, shares her insights on how to navigate the challenges of motherhood without adhering to strict formulas.</p>
    <p>“Motherhood is a journey that is unique to every woman. There is no formula that can be applied to everyone as it’s an important phase in a woman's life that comes with different challenges, struggles, and joys”, Jani said in a recent interview.</p>
    <p>Jani is not alone in her beliefs. Many mothers feel that the best way to mother is to trust their instincts and find a style that works for them and their family, rather than following external rules.</p>
    <p>For example, a subscription service like HelloFresh may work for some families who are short on time, but others may prefer to cook meals from scratch. Similarly, some moms may prefer to co-sleep with their babies, while others may choose to have their baby in their own room or crib.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, Jani's message is that mothers should not feel the pressure to conform to someone else's idea of what motherhood should look like. Instead, they should embrace the unique journey that motherhood is and find what works best for them and their family.</p>
