    <p>Imagine being a single mother who has just lost her job. You have bills to pay, mouths to feed, and no source of income. This was the reality for many women in Australia until recently.</p>
    <p>However, new parenting payment rules have changed that. The Australian government has introduced a package of reforms that aim to reduce child poverty and domestic violence by providing more support to single parents.</p>
    <h2>Real Life Examples</h2>
    <p>One of the companies that have benefited from these reforms is <a href="https://www.centrelink.gov.au/">Centrelink</a>, the government agency responsible for delivering social security payments and services in Australia. Under the new rules, single parents can receive a higher rate of payment, and they can keep more of their earnings before their payment is reduced.</p>
    <p>Another company that has benefited from these reforms is <a href="https://www.jobactive.gov.au/">Jobactive</a>, which connects job seekers with employers. Under the new rules, single parents are given more opportunities to participate in job training and education programs, which can lead to better job prospects and earnings.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>The new parenting payment rules have helped reduce child poverty and domestic violence in Australia.</li>
     <li>The increased support for single parents provided by companies like Centrelink and Jobactive has made a significant difference in the lives of many Australians.</li>
     <li>While there is still more work to be done, these reforms are a step in the right direction for creating a fairer and more equal society.</li>
    </ol>
