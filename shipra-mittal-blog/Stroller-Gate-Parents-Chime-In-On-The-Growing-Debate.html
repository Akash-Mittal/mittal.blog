   <p>When Sarah was shopping for a stroller for her newborn, she found herself overwhelmed by the vast array of choices. She ultimately decided on a popular brand that had good reviews and seemed durable. But when news broke about a defect in the brand's design, Sarah was shocked and concerned for her baby's safety.</p>
   <p>The stroller gate controversy has taken the baby product industry by storm, causing parents to question the safety and reliability of popular brands. Companies are scrambling to address the issue and some parents are even taking legal action.</p>
   <h2>Real Life Examples</h2>
   <p>One mother, Emily, purchased a high-end stroller for her twins. It was supposed to have a safety feature that prevented it from collapsing while in use, but the mechanism failed and the stroller collapsed, injuring one of her babies. She is now suing the company for negligence.</p>
   <p>Another mother, Jenna, bought a stroller that was advertised as lightweight and easy to maneuver. But after a few weeks of use, the wheels began to wobble and the handlebars became loose. When Jenna tried to return the stroller, the company's customer service was unhelpful and dismissive.</p>
