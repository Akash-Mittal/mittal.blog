    <p>As I tuned into Mary Louise Kelly's interview on "On Point WBUR," I was immediately engrossed in the conversation that highlighted insights from her distinguished journalistic career. One of the aspects that stood out to me was how she emphasized the importance of 'real' journalism and how it can help people connect with the world around them. It also made me wonder about the companies that promote such journalism and are successful in doing so.</p>
    <p>One such company is <a href="https://www.npr.org/">National Public Radio (NPR)</a>, which has been at the forefront of delivering credible and impartial news since 1971. NPR's recent successes, like reporting on the COVID-19 pandemic, and providing real-time coverage of local and national events, have helped it garner a massive following.</p>
    <p>Another company that caught my attention was <a href="https://apnews.com/">The Associated Press (AP)</a>. AP's reliable and unbiased reporting has made it a trusted news source for people across the globe. Its responsible journalism during the 2020 U.S. Presidential elections demonstrated its commitment to maintaining journalistic standards in the face of adversity.</p>
    <p>As we talked about these companies, Mary Louise Kelly mentioned how the quality of information provided by these and other organizations has a significant impact on society. She believes that it is essential to deliver unbiased and factual information so that people can make informed decisions about important issues.</p>
    <p>While there are an abundance of news sources available, it's crucial to choose those that provide legitimate news. By doing so, we can help promote and nurture a society that values responsible journalism. It was refreshing to hear the insights shared by Mary Louise Kelly and it serves as a reminder of how crucial it is to have balanced and factual reporting.</p>
