  <h1>How Water Safety Can Save Your Child's Life</h1> <img src="images/articles/How-Water-Safety-Can-Save-Your-Child-s-Life.jpeg" alt="+How-Water-Safety-Can-Save-Your-Child-s-Life+">
  <p>In the summer of 2017, a family of four went on vacation in Florida. The parents decided to take their two young children to the hotel pool to cool off from the hot sun. While the parents were talking, the children ventured into the deep end of the pool. Before the parents knew it, they heard screaming and splashing coming from the pool. They ran to the pool and saw their children struggling to stay afloat. Fortunately, a bystander was able to grab the children and bring them safely to the side of the pool.</p>
  <h2>Real Life Examples</h2>
  <p>This story is just one of many examples of how easily water accidents can happen. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, drowning is the leading cause of unintentional injury death in children aged 1-4 years old, and the second leading cause of unintentional injury death in children aged 5-14 years old. In addition, for every child who dies from drowning, another five receive emergency department care for nonfatal submersion injuries.</p>
  <p>However, proper water safety practices can prevent these tragedies from happening. Teaching children how to swim, always having adult supervision while swimming, and keeping pools and hot tubs covered when not in use are just a few examples of water safety practices that can save lives.</p>
  <h2>Main Companies</h2>
  <p>There are also companies that provide products and services to help ensure water safety. One notable company is Life Saver Pool Fence, which designs and installs removable mesh fences around pools to keep young children safe. Additionally, Baby Otter Swim School provides survival swimming lessons to young children, teaching them crucial water safety skills such as how to float and call for help.</p>
