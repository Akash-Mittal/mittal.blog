    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>There's always been immense pressure on parents to have a perfect life. But with the rise of social media, this pressure has become even greater.</p>
    <p>Parents are bombarded with images of perfect families, perfect homes, and perfect children. It's no wonder that parents feel like they're never enough.</p>
    <p>But a group of parenting bloggers has emerged to disrupt this idea of a perfect life. They're showing that it's okay to be imperfect and that it's okay to struggle as a parent.</p>

    <h2>Real Life Examples</h2>
    <p>One of these disruptors is <a href="https://www.scarymommy.com/">Scary Mommy</a>, a parenting website that caters to imperfect parents. Scary Mommy doesn't shy away from discussing topics that most parents are embarrassed to talk about, such as postpartum depression and co-sleeping. The website has a large following of parents who appreciate its honesty and vulnerability.</p>
    <p>Another disruptor is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mommyshorts/">Mommy Shorts</a>, an Instagram account run by Ilana Wiles. Wiles documents her life as a mother of two young children, sharing both the good and the bad moments. She's become well-known for her "Average Parent Problems" series, which highlights the everyday challenges of parenting.</p>
    <p>These parenting bloggers are just two examples of the many disruptors who are changing how we think about parenting.</p>
