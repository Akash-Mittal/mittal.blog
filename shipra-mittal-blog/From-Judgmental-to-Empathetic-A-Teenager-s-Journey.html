  <p>When Emma started high school, she thought she knew everything. She was quick to criticize her classmates and teachers, often mocking them behind their backs. However, one day, she overheard a conversation between two girls who were gossiping about her. She felt hurt and embarrassed, realizing that she was just as guilty of judging as anyone else.</p>
  <p>Emma decided to change her ways. She now seeks to understand the perspectives of others, instead of jumping to conclusions. She apologized to those she had hurt in the past and started to build new relationships based on mutual respect.</p>
