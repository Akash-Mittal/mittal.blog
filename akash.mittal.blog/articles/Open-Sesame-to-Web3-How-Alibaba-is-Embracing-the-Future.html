     <p>Imagine you are a farmer in rural China, looking to sell your crops to the highest bidder. In the past, you would have had to rely on middlemen to connect you with buyers, and negotiate prices that may not be fair. But today, thanks to Alibaba's blockchain-based solution, you can sell directly to customers on the company's e-commerce platform Tmall, and receive payment instantly.</p>
     <p>Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, the Chinese multinational conglomerate specializing in e-commerce, retail, and technology, has recently announced its entry into the world of Web3 with the launch of its decentralized cloud computing platform, AliOS.</p>
