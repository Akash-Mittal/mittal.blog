   <p>When John was diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia, he had no idea that his treatment would be anything besides traditional chemotherapy. But thanks to recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), John's treatment plan was completely customized to his unique genetic makeup, leading to a higher chance of remission and a faster recovery time.</p>
   <p>John's story is just one example of the incredible potential of AI in healthcare. From diagnostic tools to treatment plans to administrative tasks, AI is transforming the way we approach healthcare and improving outcomes for patients.</p>
   <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
   <p>One of the leading companies in this field is IBM Watson Health. Their AI technology is currently being used to help diagnose and treat cancer patients, analyze electronic medical records for patterns and insights, and even predict which patients are at risk for opioid abuse.</p>
   <p>Another major player is Google Health, which has partnered with leading healthcare providers and research organizations to develop tools that can predict patient outcomes, diagnose diseases, and detect abnormalities in medical imaging.</p>
   <p>But AI isn't just for big tech companies. Smaller startups like Babylon Health are using AI to provide virtual consultations with doctors, reducing wait times and improving access to healthcare for patients in remote or underserved areas.</p>
   <h2>The Future of Healthcare Technology</h2>
   <p>As AI continues to evolve, there is no doubt that it will play an even bigger role in healthcare. From using robots to perform surgeries to developing personalized medicine based on a patient's genetic code, the possibilities are endless.</p>
   <p>However, there are also concerns about the potential dangers of relying too heavily on AI in healthcare. Who is responsible if something goes wrong? How can we ensure that marginalized communities have access to these technologies?</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>AI is changing the way we approach healthcare, improving patient outcomes and reducing costs.</li>
    <li>Big tech companies like IBM and Google are leading the way, but startups are also making a big impact.</li>
    <li>We must be careful to address ethical concerns and ensure that everyone has access to these technologies.</li>
   </ol>
