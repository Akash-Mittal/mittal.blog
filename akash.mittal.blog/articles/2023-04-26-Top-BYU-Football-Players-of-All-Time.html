   <p>When it comes to college football, BYU has a storied history that spans several decades. From legendary coaches to record-breaking players, the Cougars have left their mark on the sport. But who are the best of the best? Who are the players that truly stand out as the greatest in BYU history?</p>
   <p>To answer that question, we've compiled a list of the ten best BYU football players of all-time, based on their performances on the field and their impact on the program.</p>
   <section>
    <h2>An Interesting Story</h2>
    <p>One player who undoubtedly deserves a spot on this list is quarterback Ty Detmer. Detmer, who played for BYU from 1988 to 1991, was an absolute force on the field. He threw for over 15,000 yards and 121 touchdowns during his collegiate career, earning him the Heisman Trophy in 1990.</p>
    <p>But the most impressive thing about Detmer wasn't his impressive stats or his accolades. It was his ability to lead his team to victory, even when the odds were against them. One particularly memorable game came in 1990, when BYU was down by 18 points at halftime against SMU. Detmer rallied his team together, delivering a stunning comeback and leading the Cougars to a 45-33 win.</p>
    <p>It was moments like that that solidified Detmer's place in BYU lore, and it's why he's one of the greatest players in program history.</p>

    <h2>Concrete Examples</h2>
    <p>Detmer isn't the only player who deserves recognition, however. Here are just a few more of the standout players who made our list:</p>
    <ol>
     <li><h3>Steve Young</h3><p>Young is perhaps the most well-known BYU football player, thanks in no small part to his NFL career. But before he became a Super Bowl-winning quarterback, he was a standout player for the Cougars. Young racked up over 7,000 yards of total offense during his time at BYU, while leading the team to a 11-1 record in his final season.</p></li>
     <li><h3>Jim McMahon</h3><p>McMahon was a key player for BYU in the early 1980s, leading the team to a national championship in 1984. He was a two-time All-American and finished his career with 84 touchdown passes.</p></li>
     <li><h3>Aaron Francisco</h3><p>Francisco may not be as well-known as some of the other players on this list, but his impact on the BYU program cannot be understated. He was a standout safety in the early 2000s, earning All-American honors and helping BYU to two Mountain West Conference championships.</p></li>
    </ol>
