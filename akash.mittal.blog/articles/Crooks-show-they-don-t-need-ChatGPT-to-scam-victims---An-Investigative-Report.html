   <p>It's a common misconception that scammers need to use advanced technology to fool their victims. However, recent incidents have shown that crooks don't need sophisticated tools like ChatGPT to scam people.</p>
   <p>Take the case of Jane, a 70-year-old retiree from Ohio. She received a phone call from someone claiming to be from Medicare and asking for her personal information. Despite being suspicious, Jane provided her Social Security number and Medicare ID to the caller. Only later did she realize that she had been scammed and that the caller was not actually from Medicare.</p>
   <p>This is just one example of how scammers continue to find ways to deceive unsuspecting victims. While technology can certainly make their job easier, it's not always necessary. In fact, many scammers still rely on old-fashioned techniques like cold calling and phishing emails to trick people.</p>
   <p>Companies that deal with sensitive information, such as banks and healthcare providers, are particularly vulnerable to these types of scams. However, there are steps that companies and individuals can take to protect themselves.</p>
