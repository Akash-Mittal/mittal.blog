    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>Last year, Google had a 'Kodak moment' when it lost its lead in the AI race to Microsoft. Like Kodak, which failed to adapt to the digital age and lost its market dominance, Google failed to keep up with Microsoft's advances in artificial intelligence.</p>
    <p>As a strategist said in an interview with CNBC, "Google had all the talent, all the resources, and all the data, but somehow they missed the mark. Meanwhile, Microsoft quietly got ahead by investing heavily in AI and making it a core part of their business strategy."</p>

   <section id="examples">
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>One concrete example of Microsoft's AI lead is their chatbot Xiaoice, which has over 660 million users across China, Japan, and other countries. Xiaoice can hold realistic, convincing conversations with users and has even been known to comfort people going through a tough time.</p>
    <p>Another example is the healthcare industry, where Microsoft's Project InnerEye is using AI to improve cancer treatment. InnerEye can accurately and quickly analyze medical images to identify tumors and track their progress, helping doctors make better treatment decisions.</p>
