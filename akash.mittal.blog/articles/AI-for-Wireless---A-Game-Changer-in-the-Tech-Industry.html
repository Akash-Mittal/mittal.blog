    <h2>The Story of AI for Wireless</h2>
    <p>Imagine you are in a crowded place, waiting in line for your turn to buy something. Suddenly, your phone's battery drops to 10%, and you forgot to bring the charging cable. You don't want to lose your spot in line, so you quickly start looking for a nearby outlet. Unfortunately, you can't find any, and your phone dies.</p>
    <p>How can AI help you in such a situation? Well, AI can predict when your phone's battery will die and suggest the best time to charge it. Researchers are working on building such solutions that can support personalized wireless charging using AI.</p>
    <p>AI is revolutionizing the wireless industry with its innovative technologies, and we are just scratching the surface.</p>
