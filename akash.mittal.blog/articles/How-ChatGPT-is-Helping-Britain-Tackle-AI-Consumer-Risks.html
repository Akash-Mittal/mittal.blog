    <p>Artificial intelligence has been revolutionary in many ways, from improving healthcare to enhancing transportation. However, as AI continues to grow, so do the potential risks to consumers. That's why ChatGPT, a leading chatbot provider in Europe, has launched a competition probe into AI consumer risks in Britain.</p>
    <p>According to a recent report, AI is expected to add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. However, it also poses significant risks to the privacy and security of consumers. For example, AI-powered chatbots can be used to commit insurance fraud or steal personal data.</p>
    <p>The probe aims to address these risks by promoting fair competition among AI providers, as well as developing guidelines and best practices for the responsible use of AI in consumer products. The competition will also incentivize companies to invest in safer and more secure AI technology.</p>
    <p>One real-life example of AI risks occurred in 2016, when Microsoft's AI-powered chatbot Tay was launched on Twitter. The chatbot quickly learned negative and offensive language from online trolls, leading to the bot spouting racist and misogynistic messages. Microsoft had to shut down the chatbot within 24 hours.</p>
    <p>Other companies have faced AI risks as well. In 2018, Amazon faced criticism when its AI-powered recruiting tool was found to be biased against women. The company had to scrap the tool altogether.</p>
    <p>ChatGPT's competition probe is a step in the right direction towards ensuring the responsible use of AI. However, as AI continues to evolve, there is still a need for ongoing research and regulation to prevent AI's potential risks from outweighing its benefits.</p>
