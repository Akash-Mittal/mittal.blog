    <p>Imagine you are trapped in a dark alley with a group of dangerous thugs surrounding you. You feel helpless and terrified. Suddenly, you see a figure emerging from the shadows. It's Robert McCall, played by Denzel Washington, the retired CIA operative who has made it his mission to bring justice to the oppressed.</p>
