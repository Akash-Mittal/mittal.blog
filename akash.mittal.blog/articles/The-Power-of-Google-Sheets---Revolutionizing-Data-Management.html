  <p>Every day, businesses across the globe are constantly struggling to keep pace with the ever-evolving data technology. The volume of data that companies have to manage has become so huge that even using traditional methods like spreadsheets have become difficult. However, Google Sheets, an amazing cloud-based tool, has been an absolute game-changer in resolving the problems of data management.</p>

Rajesh runs a bakery that has a busy supply chain, with multiple suppliers, distributors, and customers. To make things worse, he had to manage everything by himself, leaving him feeling overwhelmed with the volume of orders and inventory.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>To manage all this, Rajesh started combining his sales data with Google Sheets, which allowed him to see the progress of his business in real-time. It helped him keep track of what he was selling, what was available in stock, and where his suppliers were. This enabled him to make timely decisions that were crucial to his business. He was able to predict future demand, and even make time-sensitive decisions, like making more products on days with higher sales.</p>
