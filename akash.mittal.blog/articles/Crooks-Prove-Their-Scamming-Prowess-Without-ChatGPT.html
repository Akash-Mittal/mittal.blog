    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>ChatGPT is a popular chatbot platform that allows businesses to interact with their customers in a conversational manner. It has gained popularity in recent years due to its ability to streamline customer support and enhance user experience. However, not all businesses have access to ChatGPT, and scammers have come up with a way to exploit this situation.</p>
    <p>Scammers have found new ways to lure victims into their traps, without using ChatGPT. These crooks use social engineering and other methods to deceive the victims. They also use voice and video calling features to make their scam seem more legitimate. These tactics have proven to be very effective, and the scammers have managed to steal large sums of money from unsuspecting victims.</p>

    <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
    <p>One victim was contacted by someone claiming to be from their bank. The scammer told the victim that there had been suspicious activity on their account, and they needed to transfer their money to a "safe account" to avoid losing it. The scammer then provided a fake account number and routing code, and the victim fell for the trick, losing thousands of dollars.</p>
    <p>In another case, a victim received a call from someone claiming to be from the IRS. The scammer told the victim that they owed back taxes and needed to pay immediately to avoid legal action. The scammer then directed the victim to purchase prepaid gift cards and provide the card information over the phone. The victim lost hundreds of dollars in this scam.</p>
