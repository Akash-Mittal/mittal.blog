   <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <p>In the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency, there is always something new happening. Recently, Consensus â one of the top blockchain technology solutions providers â released some exciting news about Web3, the next generation of the internet.</p>
   <h2>The Problem with Web2</h2>
   <p>Most of us use Web2 every day â it's the internet we know and love. However, Web2 has some issues. It's controlled by only a few big companies, it's not very secure, and our data is constantly vulnerable to cyberattacks. Web2 is also notorious for its lack of privacy and transparency.</p>
   <p>Enter Web3. The decentralized internet of the future aims to solve these problems through blockchain technology, which ensures transparency, security, and privacy for all users.</p>
   <h2>Real-Life Examples of Web3</h2>
   <p>One example of a Web3 application is Brave, a decentralized browser that rewards users with cryptocurrency for their attention and data. Another example is Golem, a decentralized supercomputer that harnesses the power of idle computers worldwide.</p>
   <p>But Web3 isn't just for small startups. Major companies like Microsoft and IBM are also getting in on the action, adopting blockchain technology to improve their products and services for maximum clarity, security, and privacy.</p>
   <h2>The Role of Consensus</h2>
   <p>Consensus is at the forefront of the Web3 revolution, providing the technology solutions that allow blockchain to flourish.</p>
   <p>One of the most exciting things about Consensus is that it's not just for big corporations. With their open-source platform, developers and individuals can work with Consensus to create decentralized applications and bring the power of blockchain to everyday users.</p>

    <li>Adoption of blockchain technology can be slow among larger corporations, so it's important to continue raising awareness and education on its benefits.</li>
