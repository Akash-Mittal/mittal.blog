  <p>As the world continues to evolve, businesses must embrace new technologies to remain competitive. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), one of the largest accounting firms in the world, is doing just that by embracing Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT to enhance its services.</p>

  <h2>Concrete Examples</h2>

PwC is now able to automate routine and repetitive tasks through chatbots that identify potential anomalies and anomalies in financial statements. This allows auditors to focus on more complex areas of the audit and avoid errors during the review process.</p>
  <p>Another example of PwC's AI innovation is its predictive analytics tool. This provides clients with insight into future business trends and business scenarios, allowing them to make better-informed decisions. Through AI, PwC is able to offer its clients more value-added and data-driven services.</p>
