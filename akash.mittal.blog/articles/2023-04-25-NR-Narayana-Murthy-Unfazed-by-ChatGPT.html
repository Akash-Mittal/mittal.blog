  <p>NR Narayana Murthy, founder of Infosys, has been a towering figure in the Indian IT industry for decades. He is known for his visionary leadership and his ability to anticipate trends in technology and business. So when he was asked recently about his thoughts on ChatGPT, the new AI-powered chatbot that has been making headlines, his response was eagerly awaited.</p>
  <p>ChatGPT is a chatbot that uses AI to generate human-like responses to natural language queries. It has been hailed as a breakthrough in the field of natural language processing and has been adopted by companies across various industries. However, there are concerns that chatbots like ChatGPT could replace human jobs, especially in the customer service sector.</p>
  <p>When asked about his thoughts on ChatGPT, Murthy was unfazed. "Technology has always been a part of the IT industry, and we have always embraced it," he said. "ChatGPT is just the latest in a long line of technological innovations that are transforming the way we do business."</p>
  <p>Murthy went on to explain that while chatbots like ChatGPT may be able to handle simple queries, they are unlikely to replace human workers entirely. "There will always be a need for human interaction in many areas of business," he said. "Chatbots can supplement that interaction, but they cannot replace it."</p>
  <p>Murthy's comments are in line with the views of many experts in the field of AI and robotics. They believe that rather than replacing human jobs, AI and robotics will augment them, allowing workers to focus on more complex and creative tasks.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, NR Narayana Murthy's views on ChatGPT are reassuring for those who are concerned about the impact of AI on the job market. While there is no doubt that chatbots like ChatGPT will become more prevalent in the future, they are unlikely to replace human workers entirely. As Murthy observed, "technology is a tool, and it is up to us to use it wisely."</p>
