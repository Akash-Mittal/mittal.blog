  <p>One evening, Sarah was scrolling through her Snapchat stories when she came across a news story that caught her attention. The story was about Snapchat's AI chatbot, which was found to be storing user data without their consent. Sarah was shocked to hear this and immediately decided to delete Snapchat from her phone. She was not alone. Many other Snapchat users were leaving the platform due to similar privacy concerns caused by their AI chatbot.</p>
  <h2>Real life examples of privacy concerns caused by AI chatbots</h2>
  <p>Many companies are using AI chatbots to interact with their customers. However, the use of AI chatbots has raised privacy concerns among users. Here are some examples:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/amazon-discloses-social-media-privacy-found-work-78944368">Amazon</a> - Last year, Amazon's AI chatbot Alexa was found to be storing voice recordings of users without their consent.</li>
   <li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/22/17379508/google-assistant-police-contract-ai-surveillance">Google</a> - In 2018, it was discovered that Google's AI chatbot was helping the police in the US to identify suspects by analyzing their conversations with Google Assistant.</li>
   <li><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2021/06/30/microsofts-new-ai-chatbot-can-generate-fake-conversations-that-are-eerily-realistic/?sh=1ff2ee6116b8">Microsoft</a> - Recently, Microsoft created an AI chatbot that could generate fake conversations based on real-life conversations without the users' consent.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The use of AI chatbots is increasing, but so are the privacy concerns. Companies need to be transparent about their use of AI chatbots and inform users about how their data is being collected and used. Users, on the other hand, need to be more cautious about the apps they use and the kind of data they are sharing with these apps. It is important to strike a balance between innovation and privacy.</p>
