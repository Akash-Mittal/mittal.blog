   <p>Reality TV has taken over our screens and one of the most popular reality shows is undoubtedly Real Housewives. As the name suggests, the show features the lives of wealthy housewives living their glamorous life, but it also showcases their drama, catfights, and arguments. However, not all housewives are created equal and some have earned a reputation as the worst.</p>
   <h2>An Interesting Story</h2>
   <p>One such example is Vicki Gunvalson from The Real Housewives of Orange County. She has been on the show since it started in 2006 and has been known for her loud and confrontational personality. In one infamous scene, she flipped a table during an argument and vowed to "whoop it up" after admitting to cheating on her ex-husband. Her behaviour has earned her the nickname of "OG of the OC", but it has also made her one of the most disliked housewives in the franchise.</p>
   <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
   <p>Another housewife who has caused controversy is Brandi Glanville from The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. She first joined the show in season 2 and quickly made an impact by revealing she had slept with one of the other housewives' husbands. She has also made derogatory comments about her own castmates and has been involved in numerous arguments. Her behaviour has caused her to be labelled as "trashy" and "classless" by fans and even her own castmates.</p>
   <h2>Hyperlinked Companies</h2>
   <p>One of the companies behind the success of the Real Housewives franchise is Bravo, which is owned by NBCUniversal. The show has also spawned numerous spin-offs, including The Real Housewives of New York City, The Real Housewives of Atlanta, and The Real Housewives of Dallas. Each franchise has its own set of housewives and drama.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, while Real Housewives is entertaining to watch, not all housewives are likable. Vicki Gunvalson and Brandi Glanville are just two examples of housewives who have earned a reputation as the worst in the franchise. Their behaviour has caused controversy and even made them disliked by fans. However, as long as there is drama, the Real Housewives franchise is likely to continue to be popular.</p>
