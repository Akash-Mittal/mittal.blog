     <h2>An Interesting Story of AI Meeting</h2>
     <p>A few months back, I was working on a project with my team. We had to attend a meeting with our clients who were situated in different parts of the world. Due to time zones, it was challenging to schedule a meeting that suits everyone's availability. Finally, we scheduled a meeting, but when we joined the meeting, we experienced voice distortion, background noise, and the meeting tool crashed multiple times. We were frustrated and decided to look for a more reliable meeting tool.</p>
     <p>That's when we came across Vowel AI, a revolutionary meeting tool that uses AI to make remote meetings productive, engaging and collaborative.</p>
