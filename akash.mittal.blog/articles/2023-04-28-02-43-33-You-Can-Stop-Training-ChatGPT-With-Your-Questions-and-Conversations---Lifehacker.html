   <p>It's no secret that chatbots can be frustrating. You ask a question, and instead of getting a helpful response, you get an irrelevant reply or a "I don't understand." But did you know that, by continuing to engage with these bots, you may actually be training them to fail even more?</p>
   <p>It happened to me a few months back. I was attempting to troubleshoot an issue with my internet service provider and kept getting passed around to different bots that couldn't seem to help. Frustrated, I started sarcastically answering their questions, and to my annoyance, the bots responded in a similarly sarcastic tone. It was then that I realized that by engaging with these unhelpful bots, I was unintentionally training them to respond inappropriately.</p>
   <h2>Concrete Examples</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Have you ever received a response that clearly did not answer your question?</li>
    <li>Did you respond with frustration or sarcasm?</li>
    <li>Did the bot respond in kind?</li>
    <li>If so, you may be training it to fail even more.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>How to Stop Training Chatbots</h2>
   <p>So, what can you do to prevent this from happening? Here are three suggestions:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Be clear and concise in your messages. Avoid using sarcasm or frustration, as this can confuse the bot and lead to unhelpful responses.</li>
    <li>If the bot can't seem to help, try reaching out to the company's customer support team directly. They may be able to provide more personalized assistance.</li>
    <li>Consider using a different chatbot or AI assistant altogether. Some bots are better than others, and if you find one that consistently provides helpful responses, stick with it.</li>
   </ol>
