    <p>Metaverse has been the buzzword in the investment community for the past few months. Crypto investors are trying to get in on the ground floor of the next big thing. However, recent trends suggest that investors are turning away from Apecoin APE and Axie Infinity AXS and focusing on Web 3 companies.</p>
    <p>One reason for this shift is the oversaturation of the market. It seems like every day there is a new metaverse coin being launched. Investors are getting cautious, and they are looking for companies that have a more significant role in the Web 3 ecosystem.</p>
    <p>One such company is Unstoppable Domains. It is one of the most promising Web 3 companies, and its decentralized domains are becoming increasingly popular among investors. Another company that has caught the attention of investors is Mirror Protocol. The company aims to democratize access to the traditional financial system through tokens that represent traditional assets.</p>
    <p>However, Apecoin APE and Axie Infinity AXS are not entirely out of the game. Both companies have experienced some setbacks recently, but they are still going strong. APE, the native token of Apecoin, has dropped by around 30% in the past month. AXS, on the other hand, has been on a downward trend for the past three months.</p>
    <p>A notable real-life example of the shift to Web 3 companies is the recent $10 million funding round for MetaFactory. The company is a Web 3-focused platform that allows users to buy, sell and trade limited-edition goods that are either physically or digitally created. The round was led by Polychain Capital and included investors like Coinbase Ventures and The LAO.</p>
