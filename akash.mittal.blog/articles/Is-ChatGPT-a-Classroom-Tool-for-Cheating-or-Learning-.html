    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>It was the day before the final exams for the physics class of a prestigious university. The students were busy revising the topics and solving sample papers. Amidst the chaos, a group of students were seen huddled together with their phones out, chatting on ChatGPT.</p>
    <p>One of the students noticed their professor approaching, and they quickly disguised their phones. The professor stopped by and asked them what they were doing. They responded by saying they were discussing the concepts of quantum mechanics. The professor was impressed and continued to interact with them, unaware that they were actually sharing answers and discussing cheat sheets for the upcoming exams.</p>

    <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
    <p>ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence-based chatbot that provides answers to usersâ?? questions through a conversational interface. Developed by GPT-3, the tool has found applications in various fields, including education.</p>
    <p>Students, particularly those who struggle with traditional teaching methods, have found ChatGPT to be an easy and accessible learning tool. They can ask questions, get immediate responses, and learn at their own pace. However, ChatGPT has also emerged as a possible tool for cheating in exams, as seen in the story above.</p>
    <p>Real-life examples of ChatGPT being used for cheating have been reported in various parts of the world. In India, a group of students used ChatGPT to cheat in their entrance examinations for engineering colleges. In the United States, a high school student used ChatGPT to cheat on a biology test. These incidents have raised concerns about the ethical implications of using AI chatbots for academic purposes.</p>

    <h2>Main Companies</h2>
    <p>ChatGPT is the brainchild of OpenAI, a research organization that aims to promote artificial intelligence for the benefit of humanity. OpenAI was founded in 2015 by tech luminaries such as Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, who were concerned about the impact of AI on society.</p>
    <p>Another key player in the AI chatbot space is Microsoft, which has its own chatbot platform called Microsoft Bot Framework. Microsoft Bot Framework allows developers to build bots for various channels, including Facebook Messenger and Skype.</p>
    <p>Facebook is also a major player in the chatbot space, with its Messenger platform being widely used for customer service and other business applications. Facebook has been investing heavily in AI and has developed several chatbots, including its own in-house chatbot called M.</p>
