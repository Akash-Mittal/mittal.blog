   <p>Air India, the national carrier of India, is one of the most reputable and trusted airlines in the country. However, in recent years, it has been marred by controversies surrounding its HR policies, particularly towards its pilots. According to pilot bodies, Air India's HR policies are not only draconian but also unethical. For instance, pilots have to work overtime without getting paid and are subjected to long working hours, which results in mental and physical stress that affects their performance and safety.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, Air India's HR policies are also affecting its pilot's career growth. Pilots are not promoted based on their merit and experience but on their seniority, thereby creating a demotivating work environment. This practice not only affects the morale of the pilots but also hampers the overall growth of the airline.</p>
   <p>Recently, several pilots have raised their voice against these draconian and unethical HR policies of Air India. In fact, a few have left the airline and joined other airlines, where the work environment is more supportive and conducive for their professional growth.</p>
   <p>It is high time that Air India revisits its HR policies and makes necessary changes to create a better work environment for its pilots. This not only ensures their safety and well-being but also reflects positively on the airline's overall performance.</p>
