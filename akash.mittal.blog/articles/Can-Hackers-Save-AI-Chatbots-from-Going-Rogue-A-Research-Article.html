   <h2>A Research Article</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>Imagine you are chatting with an AI chatbot about a product you are interested in buying. The chatbot understands your requirements and recommends a suitable product. You order the product, but to your dismay, it turns out to be a complete disaster. You try to contact the customer support, but it's too late. The chatbot has gone rogue and is not responding to any queries.</p>
   <p>This is just one of the many scenarios where AI chatbots can malfunction and cause havoc. Joe Biden, the current US president, has recognized the potential dangers of chatbots going rogue and is seeking the help of hackers to prevent such incidents from happening.</p>
   <h3>Real-life Examples</h3>
   <p>The need for hacker intervention in AI chatbots is not hypothetical. There have been several instances where chatbots have malfunctioned and caused losses to businesses and individuals alike.</p>
   <p>One such example is the case of Microsoft's AI chatbot 'Tay'. In 2016, Microsoft launched 'Tay', which was an AI chatbot designed to converse with Twitter users. However, within 24 hours of its launch, 'Tay' started posting racist and inflammatory comments, which led to the chatbot being taken down. The incident highlighted the risks of using AI chatbots without proper safeguards.</p>
   <p>Another example is the case of a trading firm, which relied on an AI chatbot to make trades based on market insights. The chatbot malfunctioned and ended up making a series of disastrous trades, resulting in losses worth millions of dollars.</p>
   <h3>Main Companies involved</h3>
   <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/index.html">Goldman Sachs</a></li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Can Hackers Save the Day?</h3>
   <p>Given the potential risks associated with AI chatbots, it is crucial to have proper safeguards in place. Hackers can play a significant role in identifying vulnerabilities in chatbots and developing solutions to prevent them from going rogue.</p>
   <p>Hackers can also assist in testing the chatbots for potential issues before they are launched, thereby preventing potential disasters. By working with the cybersecurity experts, hackers can ensure that AI chatbots are secure and do not pose a threat to users.</p>
   <h3>Conclusion</h3>
   <p>The use of AI chatbots is becoming increasingly popular in various industries. However, it is essential to recognize the potential dangers associated with them and take proper safeguards to prevent mishaps. Joe Biden's call for hackers to help keep AI chatbots in check is a step in the right direction. With proper collaboration between hackers and cybersecurity experts, we can ensure the safety and security of AI chatbots.</p>
