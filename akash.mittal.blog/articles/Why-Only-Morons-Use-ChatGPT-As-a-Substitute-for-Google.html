    <h2>An Interesting Story to Start</h2>
    <p>John was a high school student who often used ChatGPT as a substitute for Google. One day, he had a biology assignment and was looking for information about mitochondria. He asked ChatGPT "What are mitochondria?" and the AI-powered chatbot responded, "They are the powerhouses of the cell." John thought he had found all the information he needed for his assignment, but when he presented his paper to his teacher, he got a failing grade. The reason? The information he got from ChatGPT was too general and lacked the depth and detail his teacher was looking for.</p>
    <p>This is just one example of the dangers of using ChatGPT as a substitute for Google. In this research article, we will explore why only morons use ChatGPT in this way and the real-life consequences of doing so.</p>
