   <p>Imagine you wake up one day and all the routine tasks, from making breakfast to booking a ride, are being done by robots. It may sound like a scene from a science fiction movie, but with the advancements in technology, the possibility is not far-fetched.</p>
   <p>Over the years, technology has proven to be a game-changer in almost every field, from healthcare to transportation. Here are a few real-life examples:</p>
   <ol>
    <li><a href="https://www.tesla.com/">Tesla</a>: Tesla has revolutionized the automobile industry with its electric cars. Its Autopilot system uses cameras and sensors to navigate and control the vehicle.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/watch/">Apple Watch</a>: The watch not only tells time but also acts as a fitness tracker, heart rate monitor, and even a tool to detect irregular heart rhythms.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.oculus.com/quest/">Oculus Quest</a>: The virtual reality headset offers an immersive experience, allowing users to explore new worlds and play games in a 360-degree environment.</li>
   </ol>
   <p>These examples are just the tip of the iceberg. From AI-powered chatbots to 3D-printed prosthetics, technology is shaping the future in unimaginable ways.</p>
   <p>While there are obvious benefits to these advancements, there are also some critical questions that need to be addressed:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>What will happen to the jobs that are being replaced by automation?</li>
    <li>How will technology impact our privacy and security?</li>
    <li>What are the long-term effects of our over-dependence on technology?</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Only time will tell how technology will ultimately shape our future, but one thing is certain - it will continue to play a pivotal role in our lives.</p>
