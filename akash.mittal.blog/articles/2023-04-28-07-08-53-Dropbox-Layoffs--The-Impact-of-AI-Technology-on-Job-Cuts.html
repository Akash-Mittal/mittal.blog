     <h2>A Personal Experience</h2>
     <p>Not too long ago, I was a young professional working for a small tech startup. Despite my passion for the industry, I was let go due to restructuring and automation of certain tasks. My position had become obsolete in the face of artificial intelligence technology, which was taking over many of the responsibilities previously held by humans.</p>

     <h2>Real Life Examples</h2>
     <p>My personal experience is just one of many happening in companies all over the world, including Dropbox. In September 2020, the cloud storage and file sharing company announced a 16% reduction in its workforce, with AI technology being cited as a major factor. In a blog post, the company stated, "We've improved overall productivity and efficiency, and made a number of tough calls about reducing costs ... This means that we're reducing our global workforce by approximately 315 people."</p>
     <p>Other companies in various industries have also turned to automation and AI technology to boost efficiency and cut costs. Retail giant Walmart introduced robots to assist with inventory and cleaning, while fast food chains like McDonald's and Burger King implemented self-order kiosks.</p>

     <h2>The Future of the Workforce</h2>
     <ol>
      <li>The rise of automation and AI technology cannot be ignored, especially in our rapidly changing digital landscape. While these advancements bring many benefits, they also have a significant impact on the workforce, including potential job losses and restructuring.</li>
      <li>It is crucial for companies to have a forward-thinking strategy for implementing new technologies, including proper training and support for employees, and exploring new job opportunities and roles that may arise.</li>
      <li>We must also consider the societal implications of automation on income inequality and explore potential solutions, such as universal basic income and job retraining programs.</li>
