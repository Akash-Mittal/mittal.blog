    <p>As someone who suffers from a gluten intolerance, I know firsthand how frustrating it can be to find suitable food options at restaurants and grocery stores. But it's not just me - millions of people all over the world have dietary restrictions that can make it difficult to find food that fits within their requirements.</p>
    <p>However, some companies are making an effort to cater to this growing market of customers. Take for example, <a href="https://www.chipotle.com/dietary-options">Chipotle</a>, which allows customers to filter menu items based on their dietary needs, including gluten-free, vegan, and vegetarian options. Similarly, <a href="https://www.ubereats.com/us/en/search/?q=gluten%20free">Uber Eats</a> has added a filter for gluten-free options in its app, making it easier for customers to find suitable food choices.</p>
    <p>It's not just restaurants and food delivery services that are adapting to dietary restrictions. Major companies like <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/partnering/healthcare-professionals/food-allergy-resource-initiative">Pfizer</a> and <a href="https://www.nestle.com/aboutus/halal-and-kosher-certification">Nestle</a> have gone through the process of obtaining halal and kosher certifications, allowing them to cater to customers with specific religious requirements. And even companies like <a href="https://www.dove.com/us/en/stories/about-dove/our-commitments/reducing-plastic-waste/rinse-repeat-campaign.html">Dove</a> have recognized the importance of catering to customers with specific needs - their recent "Rinse. Recycle. Repeat." campaign highlighted their commitment to reducing plastic waste, making them a top choice for environmentally conscious consumers.</p>
