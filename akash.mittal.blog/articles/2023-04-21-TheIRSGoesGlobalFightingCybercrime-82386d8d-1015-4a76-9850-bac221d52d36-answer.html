   <p>Many of us have received suspicious emails before. Some claiming we've won the lottery, others warning us about issues with our bank accounts. While many of these emails are easy to spot as scams, some are more sophisticated and can lead to identity theft, stolen funds, and more.</p>
   <p>That's where the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the American organization tasked with collecting taxes, comes in. According to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/?p=2532113">TechCrunch</a>, the IRS is sending four investigators across the world to fight cybercrime.</p>
   <p>The investigators will be stationed in the Netherlands, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Canada. These locations were chosen because they are home to many internet service providers (ISPs) and web hosting companies. By being onsite, the investigators will be able to work more closely with these companies to track down cybercriminals and prevent future attacks.</p>
   <p>But what exactly will these investigators be doing? According to <a href="https://www.irs.gov/compliance/criminal-investigation/criminal-investigation-enforcement-actions-and-results">the IRS's website</a>, the Criminal Investigation (CI) division is responsible for investigating tax-related crimes, including those committed online. The CI works closely with other law enforcement agencies both in the U.S. and abroad to identify and prosecute criminals. The four new investigators will be part of the CI's Global Cyber Alliance, a group dedicated to fighting cyber-related crimes around the world.</p>
   <h2>Example</h2>
   <p>Some recent cybercrimes that the IRS has been involved in include:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>A large-scale phishing scheme that led to the arrest of multiple individuals in the U.S. and overseas</li>
    <li>The takedown of a "darkweb" marketplace, resulting in the arrest of multiple people in the U.S. and Europe</li>
    <li>An investigation into the theft of identities from a tax preparer that resulted in the arrest of an individual in Vietnam</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>The IRS is taking action to combat cybercrime by sending investigators to key locations around the world.</li>
    <li>These investigators will be part of the Criminal Investigation division's Global Cyber Alliance, which is dedicated to fighting cybercrime.</li>
    <li>The effort to prosecute cybercriminals is ongoing and encompasses a wide range of tax and financial-related crimes.</li>
   </ol>
