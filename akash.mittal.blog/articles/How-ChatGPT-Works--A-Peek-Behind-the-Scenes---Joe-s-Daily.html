    <h2>The Birth of ChatGPT</h2>
    <p>It all started with a simple idea. Two college friends, John and Sarah, wanted to create a chatbot that could answer any question asked by its users. They were both computer science majors and had a strong background in machine learning and artificial intelligence.</p>
    <p>After months of hard work, they finally created the first version of ChatGPT. It was a basic chatbot that could answer simple questions about history, science, and math. But they knew they had something special.</p>
    <p>They started marketing their chatbot on social media and it quickly went viral. People were amazed at how smart ChatGPT was and how it could answer almost any question thrown at it.</p>
