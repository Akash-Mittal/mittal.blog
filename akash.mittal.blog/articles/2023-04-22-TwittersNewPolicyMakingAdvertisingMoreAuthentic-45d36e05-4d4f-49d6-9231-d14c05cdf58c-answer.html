    <p>Have you ever scrolled down your Twitter timeline and stumbled upon a sponsored tweet that just didn't seem genuine? As an avid Twitter user, it can be frustrating to see dishonest content appear on your feed. Well, Twitter has heard our complaints and has taken action to prevent it from happening.</p>
    <p>Starting today, Twitter is implementing a new policy that requires advertisers to obtain verified accounts to promote their content. This means that all ads will go through a stricter approval process, ensuring that content is truthful and reliable.</p>
    <p>Twitter's decision to implement this policy was in response to increasing concerns of fake news and dishonest advertising. With verified accounts, users can trust that the ad they are seeing is from a legitimate source.</p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>To better understand the implications of Twitter's new policy, here are a few examples:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>A small business owner promoting their product will need to go through a verification process before their ad goes live. This will prevent competitors from creating fake accounts and running misleading ads against them.</li>
     <li>A political candidate promoting their campaign will also need to have a verified account, preventing false information from being spread to voters.</li>
     <li>A major brand promoting a new product must also obtain a verified account. This ensures that customers can trust the information being presented to them.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>To sum up..</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>Twitter's new policy requires advertisers to obtain verified accounts to promote their content</li>
     <li>The policy ensures that all ads go through a stricter approval process to prevent false information from being spread</li>
     <li>Verified accounts build trust between users and advertisers, making Twitter a more authentic platform</li>
    </ol>
