    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Blockchain technology has been gaining popularity as more industries and companies adopt it for secure and transparent transactions. Along with this, there has been a surge in the creation and trade of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are unique digital assets that can represent anything from art to music to sports memorabilia. These two areas have led to the development of Web3, which is the decentralized internet powered by blockchain technology. Here are 5 companies leading the charge with Web3 and NFT patents.</p>
