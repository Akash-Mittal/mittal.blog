  <h1>White House Hosts ChatGPT to Discuss AI Safety</h1> <img src="../images/White-House-Hosts-ChatGPT-to-Discuss-AI-Safety.jpeg" alt="+White-House-Hosts-ChatGPT-to-Discuss-AI-Safety+">
  <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful tool that is rapidly advancing and changing the world in various ways. It has the potential to greatly benefit humanity, but it also poses significant risks, particularly when it comes to safety and security. To address these concerns, the White House recently hosted a roundtable discussion with leading AI companies, including Google and Microsoft.</p>
  <p>The discussion, held on August 27, 2021, focused on the need for AI safety mechanisms and regulations. The companies shared their insights on developing AI in an ethical and transparent manner. They also discussed how to address potential safety risks and prevent unanticipated consequences from AI systems.</p>
  <p>During the discussion, several real-life examples were shared, highlighting the potential dangers of AI. One such example was the case of automated vehicles. While these vehicles have the potential to greatly reduce traffic fatalities, they also pose serious safety risks if they malfunction or are hacked.</p>
