    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>In Saskatoon, a small craft brewery owner, Tom, heard about a new technology called ChatGPT that could design beer recipes. At first, he was excited to use it to improve his brewing process. However, he soon realized that the technology could replace him completely.</p>
    <p>Tom decided to challenge the automation and see if his human touch could still beat the robot's precision. He designed two beers, one using ChatGPT's recipe and the other using his own creativity. He invited his customers to a blind taste-test and waited anxiously for the results.</p>

    <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
    <p>Tom's challenge is not unique. Many industries are turning to automation to improve efficiency and reduce costs. However, there are still areas in which humans excel.</p>
    <p>For example, in the medical field, robots can perform complex surgeries with greater accuracy. However, they lack the emotional intelligence and instincts that human doctors possess to make critical decisions.</p>
    <p>In the hospitality industry, hotels are using chatbots to handle customer inquiries and bookings. While they can provide quick responses, they cannot replace the personal touch of a human concierge.</p>
