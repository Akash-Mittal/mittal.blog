    <p>As a dog owner and avid gardener, I know firsthand how important it is to ensure that our furry friends are safe and secure while we indulge in our outdoor activities. One day, while tending to my garden, my dog, Toby, ran straight through my flower bed, trampling my prized tulips in the process. It was then that I realized that I needed to make a few changes in my gardening routine if I wanted to keep both my plants and my dog safe.</p>
    <h2>Concrete Examples</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>Be careful when using fertilizers, pesticides, or any harmful chemicals in your garden. Keep them out of reach of your dog and always follow the instructions on the label.</li>
     <li>Avoid planting toxic plants, such as lilies, daffodils, and foxglove, which can cause severe symptoms in dogs if ingested.</li>
     <li>Install a fenced area or designated space in your garden for your dog to play in. This will not only keep them safe but also prevent them from damaging your precious plants.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>Keep harmful chemicals and toxic plants out of reach of your dog to avoid any health risks.</li>
     <li>Create a designated area for your dog to play in to prevent any accidental damage to your garden.</li>
     <li>Always supervise your dog when they're in the garden to ensure their safety and prevent any mishaps.</li>
    </ol>
