  <main>
   <p>Once upon a time, in the early days of the World Wide Web, URLs were simple and straightforward. They were nothing more than a way to give a web browser directions to a particular server and file. However, as the web grew and evolved, so did URLs.</p>
   <p>Today, URLs are complex and dynamic. They contain a wealth of information about the content they lead to, including the protocol, domain, subdomain, path, and more. They have become an essential tool for navigating the web, and they continue to change and adapt to new technologies.</p>
   <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
   <p>One notable example of the evolution of URLs is the introduction of encrypted connections. In the early days of the web, URLs used the HTTP protocol by default, which sent information in plain text. This made it easy for hackers to intercept and steal sensitive data. To combat this, the HTTPS protocol was introduced, which encrypts data in transit. Today, many top websites use HTTPS by default to protect user privacy.</p>
   <p>Another example of the evolution of URLs is the rise of short URLs. These are URLs that are compressed into a smaller format, often using a URL shortener service. They are convenient for sharing on social media and in other places where character limits apply. However, they also pose a security risk, as they can be used to hide malicious links.</p>
   <h2>Main Companies in the Article</h2>
   <p>Some of the main companies involved in the evolution of URLs include:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Google (https://www.google.com/)</li>
    <li>Twitter (https://twitter.com/)</li>
    <li>Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/)</li>
    <li>Bitly (https://bitly.com/)</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In summary, the evolution of URLs has been a fascinating journey. From simple protocols to encrypted connections and short links, URLs have adapted to match the needs of the web. As technology continues to advance, we can expect to see even more changes and innovations in the world of URLs.</p>
   <p>Some critical comments on this topic are:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>While short URLs are convenient, they should be used with care and caution to avoid security risks.</li>
    <li>Encryption is vital for protecting user privacy, and all websites should strive to use HTTPS by default.</li>
    <li>The continued evolution of URLs is essential for keeping pace with changing technologies and user needs.</li>
