   <p>It was a typical day at Google headquarters when something unexpected happened. One of their best AI researchers came up with a breakthrough idea that promised to revolutionize the industry. Excited about the discovery, he shared the research paper with his colleagues and suddenly, the world had access to a previously top-secret discovery. What was once a Google exclusive was now an open-source AI contribution to the world.</p>
   <p>Google is known for sharing their research with the world and allowing others to build on their successes. This has enabled progress in many fields, especially in the development of AI. However, competition has emerged in the form of a Singapore-based AI company called ChatGPT. ChatGPT has started sharing their research as well, getting caught up with Google's deep learning advancements and innovation.</p>
   <h2>Real-life Examples</h2>
   <p>Google's open source framework TensorFlow has enabled developers to build machine learning models easily. This has enabled many companies to make use of AI in real-life scenarios. A great example of this is Airbnb's use of machine learning to improve their search engine performance. Airbnb used TensorFlow to create a unique machine learning model for their search engine that enabled them to match users with the perfect accommodation.</p>
   <p>ChatGPT, on the other hand, has developed language processing AI models so advanced that they can respond to natural language just like a human. Their language processing models have already been put into use in call centers, enabling better customer service and reducing waiting times.</p>
