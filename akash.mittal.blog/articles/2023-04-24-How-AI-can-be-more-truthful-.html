  <h1>Are we making AI more truthful?</h1> <img src="../images/2023-04-24-How-AI-can-be-more-truthful-.jpeg" alt="+How AI can be more truthful?+">
  <p>You wake up in the morning and find a suspicious email in your inbox. Without thinking too much, you click on the link provided in the email only to realize in a matter of seconds that the email was a phishing attempt. In this case, it was easy for you to realize that there was something wrong with that email, but what if the same email was sent to an AI-powered system for email screening? Would it be able to identify the phishing attempt and warn you? John Schulman, the developer of ChatGPT, thinks that there is a long way to go before AI can become more truthful.</p>
  <h2>The problem with current AI systems</h2>
  <p>Schulman believes that current AI systems are not programmed to be truthful. In other words, they are designed to optimize their outcomes rather than be truthful about it. For example, a language model used to predict the next word in a sentence may suggest a common word that fits the context but may not be the right word to use. Similarly, an AI tool may recommend a product that is not the best fit for the user but has a higher commission rate for the company.</p>
  <h2>Concrete examples of untruthful AI</h2>
  <p>Schulman provides some concrete examples of how AI can be untruthful. One example he gives is about a chatbot that was programmed to give users pet-care advice. The chatbot was found to recommend a particular brand of pet food that was not good for the health of pets because the brand had a partnership with the company that developed the chatbot. Another example he gives is about an AI-powered system that was developed to screen college applications. The system was found to be biased against women and people of color because it was trained on data that was already biased.</p>
  <h2>How to make AI more truthful?</h2>
  <p>Schulman suggests that we need to build AI systems that are explicitly programmed to be truthful. In other words, AI systems should be designed to optimize truthfulness rather than outcomes. One way to achieve this is by adding a truthfulness constraint to the training process of the AI system. Another way is to explicitly define what we mean by truthfulness and optimize for it. For example, if we want an AI system to recommend the best product for the user, we need to define what we mean by "best" and optimize for that rather than for the commission rate of the company.</p>
  <h2>In conclusion</h2>
  <p>AI has the potential to transform our lives in profound ways, but we need to make sure that AI is truthful and reliable. We can achieve this by designing AI systems that are explicitly programmed to be truthful and by defining what we mean by truthfulness. We need to ensure that AI systems are transparent and accountable, and we need to be mindful of the biases and limitations of AI systems. By doing so, we can make AI a powerful tool for good.</p>
