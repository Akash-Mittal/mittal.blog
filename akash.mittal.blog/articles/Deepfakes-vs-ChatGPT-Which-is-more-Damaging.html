   <p>The rise of artificial intelligence has brought both marveling and devastating inventions to the world. Among them, Deepfakes and ChatGPT have been the most controversial. Both technologies can manipulate digital content in a way that can deceive people and cause disruption to society. However, which one is more damaging? Let's delve deeper into the topic.</p>
   <p>Some days ago, a video went viral on social media, where a famous celebrity was seen doing illicit activities. It was shared thousands of times, and people started protesting against the celebrity. However, soon after, it was found that the video was a Deepfake, and the celebrity was innocent. The situation could have escalated if the Deepfake was not identified, and the consequences would have been devastating.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, ChatGPT, an AI-powered chatbot, can generate realistic conversations based on the given data. ChatGPT has been used to create fake news and manipulate public opinion. For instance, the 2016 US Presidential election had several instances where social media bots generated fake news and manipulated people against a particular candidate.</p>
   <p>In recent times, Deepfakes have been more damaging than ChatGPT. Deepfakes can create videos that are almost indistinguishable from the original. They can make people say something they never said, and do something they never did. It can have severe consequences in politics, social justice, and other areas where people's trust can be manipulated. Companies like <a href="https://www.differencemakers.com/what-we-do/deeptrust-alliance/" target="_blank">Deeptrust Alliance</a> have been working to detect Deepfakes and protect society.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, ChatGPT has limited damaging potential as it requires a lot of data and customization to generate realistic conversations. It also has limited effects as it can only change people's opinion but not create false evidence as Deepfakes can. Companies like <a href="https://www.openai.com/" target="_blank">OpenAI</a> have been working to improve ChatGPT and make it more user-friendly.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, both Deepfakes and ChatGPT are dangerous technologies that require regulation and monitoring. However, Deepfakes have been more harmful than ChatGPT due to its potential to create fake evidence and manipulate people's trust. It is imperative to have checks and balances in place to identify and control Deepfakes.</p>
