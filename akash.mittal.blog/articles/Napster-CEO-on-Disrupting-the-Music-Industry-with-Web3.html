   <p>Remember the early 2000s, when Napster disrupted the music industry by offering free music downloads? It was a revolutionary idea, but it ultimately led to a legal battle that shut down the service.</p>
   <p>Now, more than 20 years later, the co-founder and former CEO of Napster, Shawn Fanning, is back with a new idea: using blockchain and Web3 technologies to disrupt the music industry once again.</p>
   <p>With the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Fanning believes that the time is ripe for a new approach to music distribution and ownership. He envisions a world where artists can sell their music directly to fans without going through record labels or streaming platforms, and where fans can own a piece of their favorite songs.</p>
   <p>Real-life examples of this approach already exist. One company, Audius, has built a decentralized music streaming platform that allows artists to upload their music and earn revenue directly from their fans. Another company, Royal, offers a platform for buying and selling fractional ownership of music copyrights.</p>
   <p>These companies are just the beginning of a new era in the music industry. Fanning believes that Web3 technologies will enable new business models that were previously impossible, and that they will ultimately benefit both artists and fans by creating a more transparent and equitable system.</p>
   <p>It remains to be seen whether Fanning's vision will become a reality, but one thing is clear: the music industry is ripe for disruption, and Web3 technologies are at the forefront of that disruption.</p>
