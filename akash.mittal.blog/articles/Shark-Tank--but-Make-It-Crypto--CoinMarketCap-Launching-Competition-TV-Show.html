   <p>Imagine a group of cryptocurrency experts come together to invest in the next big thing in the crypto world. Sounds like an interesting show, right? CoinMarketCap, the popular cryptocurrency market data provider, has announced a new competition TV show called "Coins in the Tank" that aims to do just that.</p>
   <p>The show will be similar to "Shark Tank," where entrepreneurs pitch their business ideas to investors, but with a crypto twist. Participants will pitch their blockchain-based business ideas to a panel of judges including industry experts and investors. The judges will make investment offers to the participants in exchange for equity, much like in "Shark Tank."</p>
   <p>"Coins in the Tank" is set to premiere in early 2022 and is expected to be an exciting addition to the growing crypto and blockchain TV show space.</p>
   <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>

Another episode featured a pitch for a bitcoin-based poker platform that was met with skepticism by the judges.</p>
