  <p>Have you ever found yourself here: you are on a website and you have a simple question but you cannot find your answer on the site? Then, you search for the customer support number, only to find that it is buried at the bottom of the webpage. You call the number and instead of being connected with a live customer service representative, you are stuck in an automated phone system loop. Frustrated and annoyed, you eventually give up and move on.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Thankfully, ChatGPT Plus and GPT-4 could change the game. ChatGPT Plus is a chatbot platform powered by GPT-3, which is able to understand and generate human-like responses in real-time. GPT-4, which is anticipated to be released in the near future, is expected to take this technology even further. Let's take a look at how these two platforms work in real life.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Real-Life Examples</p>

  <p>1. KhataBook: A popular Indian accounting and billing app, KhataBook has implemented ChatGPT Plus as their customer support solution. With ChatGPT, KhataBook was able to handle a 35% increase in customer support inquiries within just a few days, resulting in higher customer satisfaction rates and a 30% reduction in support expenses.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Mastercard: The global payment provider has collaborated with GPT-3 to develop their virtual voice assistant, Mastercard KAI. With conversational AI technology, KAI can help customers manage their finances seamlessly. KAI can also answer customers' questions and provides contextualized responses.</p>
