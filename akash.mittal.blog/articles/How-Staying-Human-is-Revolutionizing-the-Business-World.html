    <p class="lead">In today's digital age, businesses are often focused on technology and automation, forgetting the importance of human touch. However, some companies are realizing the value of staying human and how it can positively impact both their customers and employees.</p>

     <h2 id="story">The Story</h2>
     <p>A man walked into a restaurant and was greeted by a friendly server who asked how he was doing and engaged him in a conversation. During his meal, the server checked on him several times and made sure he was enjoying his experience. At the end, the customer was so impressed by the level of service that he not only left a generous tip, but also wrote a positive review online.</p>
     <p>This simple story highlights the power of staying human, especially in a service industry where customer experience is key. In a world where chatbots and automation are becoming increasingly common, it's important for businesses to remember that technology cannot replace the genuine human touch.</p>
     <h2 id="examples">Real Life Examples</h2>
     <p>One company that embodies the importance of staying human is Zappos, an online shoe retailer. They are known for their excellent customer service and for going above and beyond to make their customers happy. They even have a policy of offering a customer a $50 gift card if they cannot help them with their problem.</p>
     <p>Another example is Starbucks, whose CEO Kevin Johnson emphasized the importance of creating a "third place" between work and home where people can come together and connect. This led to the company implementing initiatives such as "Meet Me at Starbucks," which aimed to create a sense of community among their customers.</p>
     <h2 id="companies">Leading Companies</h2>
     <p>Some of the leading companies that prioritize staying human include:</p>
     <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.zappos.com/">Zappos</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.starbucks.com/">Starbucks</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.jetblue.com/">JetBlue</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/">American Express</a></li>
     </ul>
     <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
     <p>Staying human is important for companies to create a genuine connection with their customers and employees. By emphasizing human touch, companies can differentiate themselves in an increasingly digital world and stand out from the competition. This can lead to increased customer loyalty, positive reviews, and improved brand reputation.</p>
     <p>However, staying human requires companies to invest in training and development for their employees, as well as in creating a culture that values empathy and connection. It also requires a shift in mindset from focusing solely on technology to recognizing the importance of human interaction.</p>
     <p>In summary, staying human may require more effort, but its benefits can be significant for businesses in the long run.</p>
