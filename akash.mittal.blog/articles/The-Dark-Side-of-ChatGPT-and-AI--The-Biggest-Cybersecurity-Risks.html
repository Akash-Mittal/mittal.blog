    <p>Imagine you're an employee of a large corporation. You're working on something very important, but you need a little help. So, you turn to an AI tool called ChatGPT. It's like having a personal assistant that can assist you with anything you need, from scheduling meetings to answering emails. Sounds great, right?</p>
    <p>But what if I told you that ChatGPT could be used against your company? What if your innocent use of ChatGPT opened a backdoor for cyber attackers? What if your personal assistant wasn't who you thought it was?</p>
    <p>This scenario may seem far-fetched, but it's one of the biggest cybersecurity risks associated with the use of ChatGPT and AI by employees in companies. It's a topic that CNBC recently wrote about, highlighting the need for cybersecurity measures to protect against these types of cyber threats.</p>
    <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
    <p>The article cites a number of real-life examples where employees have used ChatGPT or other AI tools in ways that put their company at risk. For example, a developer at a tech company used an AI language model to generate sensitive data, but the model was previously trained on public datasets, making it susceptible to data leaks. In another case, a researcher inadvertently trained an AI chatbot to use profanity, which could have caused serious reputational damage to the company.</p>
    <h2>Main Companies Involved</h2>
    <p>The article references a number of companies that are involved in ChatGPT and AI technologies, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and IBM. Each of these companies is working on AI tools that can be used for various purposes, including natural language processing, chatbots, and predictive analysis.</p>
    <p>However, as the article points out, these tools can also be used in ways that put the companies that produce them at risk, as well as the companies that use them.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion and Critical Comments in 3 points</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>Cybersecurity risks associated with the use of ChatGPT and AI by employees in companies are real and should not be ignored.</li>
     <li>While these tools can be incredibly useful for employees, they can also be used in ways that put the companies that produce them at risk.</li>
     <li>Cybersecurity measures, such as training employees, implementing access controls, and monitoring for malicious activity, are essential to protecting against these types of cyber threats.</li>
