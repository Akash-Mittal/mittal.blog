  <h1>Security Concerns in Modern-Day Enterprises</h1> <img src="../images/Security-Concerns-in-Modern-Day-Enterprises.jpeg" alt="+Security Concerns in Modern-Day Enterprises+">
  <p>Once upon a time, a software company named Equifax suffered a massive data breach that exposed sensitive information like social security numbers and credit card details of more than 143 million consumers. As a result, the company had to pay millions of dollars in settlements and damage control efforts. This is just one example of how security concerns can affect not just a company's reputation, but also its finances, customer trust, and overall business operations.</p>
  <h2>Real Life Examples</h2>
  <p>Equifax is not the only company that has faced security breaches. In 2017, the ransomware WannaCry affected more than 200,000 computers across 150 countries, including the UK's National Health Service and FedEx. In 2020, the popular video-conferencing platform Zoom was criticized for its weak encryption, resulting in multiple privacy and security issues. Apart from these, there have been numerous cases of phishing attacks, password breaches, and insider threats.</p>
