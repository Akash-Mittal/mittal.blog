   <p>Imagine you are a data analyst tasked with analyzing demographic data from a social media platform. You create a heatmap to represent the distribution of age across different regions. However, as you zoom into the map, you notice that certain regions have only one or two users in the age group of 18-24. Suddenly, you realize that this information might be enough to identify those users, even though their names are not displayed. As a responsible analyst, you cannot compromise the privacy of those users.</p>
   <h2>Example</h2>
   <p>A heatmap is a graphical representation of data in which values are depicted with different colors. For instance, a heatmap could represent the number of sales per product category, per day of the week. However, when dealing with sensitive data, such as personal attributes or medical records, the goal is not to reveal specific values, but rather to understand general trends without compromising the privacy of individuals. Differential privacy is a technique that achieves this goal, by adding noise to the data without affecting the overall trend.</p>
   <p>For example, suppose a heatmap shows the number of people per city who suffer from a certain disease, sorted by age group. By adding random noise to each cell in the heatmap, the analyst can protect the privacy of individuals while still detecting which cities have a high prevalence of the disease and which age groups are affected the most.</p>

   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Differential privacy is a powerful technique for protecting the privacy of individuals while still allowing data analysis and decision making.</li>
    <li>Heatmaps are a popular tool for visualizing data, but they can compromise privacy if improperly used.</li>
    <li>Differentially private heatmaps offer a privacy-first approach to data analysis, by adding noise to the data in a controlled way, without compromising the integrity of the results.</li>
