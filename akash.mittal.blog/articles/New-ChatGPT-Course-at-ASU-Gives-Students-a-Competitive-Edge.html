   <p>In today's fast-paced technology-driven world, the ability to communicate effectively is more important than ever. Arizona State University (ASU) has recently introduced a new course that is giving their students a high-tech competitive edge in the field of communication and technology. The new course, ChatGPT, is a cutting-edge program designed to help students learn how to use AI for communication and customer service.</p>
   <p>The course is divided into two parts. In the first part, students learn about the basics of AI, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning. In the second part, students apply these concepts to create their own ChatGPT models that can be used for communication and customer service in various industries.</p>
   <p>One real-life example of a company using ChatGPT for customer service is Amazon. Amazon's Alexa device uses ChatGPT to communicate with users and answer their questions. The technology behind this is known as "conversational AI" and it is becoming increasingly popular.</p>
   <p>Another company that has already benefited from ChatGPT is Goldman Sachs. They have used the technology to develop a virtual assistant named "Marcus" that can provide guidance to customers on personal finance matters.</p>
   <p>ASU's ChatGPT course is giving students the skills they need to succeed in the rapidly-evolving world of communication and technology. By learning how to use AI for communication and customer service, they are setting themselves apart from the competition and preparing themselves for future success.</p>
