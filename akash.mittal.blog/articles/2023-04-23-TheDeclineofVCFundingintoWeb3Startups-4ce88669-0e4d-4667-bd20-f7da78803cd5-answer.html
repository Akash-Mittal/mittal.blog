    <h2>An Interesting Story</h2>
    <p>Five years ago, Joe had an idea for a startup that will leverage blockchain technology to create a decentralized social media platform. He pitched his idea to investors and received a funding of $5 million. However, the timing was not right, the market was not matured, and the product failed to gain traction. Today, Joe's startup is just a distant memory, and investors have become more cautious with their money.</p>
