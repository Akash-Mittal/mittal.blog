    <p>When Sarah noticed a strange rash on her arm, she immediately turned to the internet to try and diagnose herself. However, the information she found was confusing and only increased her anxiety. A colleague suggested she try using ChatGPT, an AI chatbot that provides quick and reliable medical advice.</p>
    <p>After answering a series of questions about her symptoms, ChatGPT suggested that Sarah might have a rare type of allergy - something that she hadn't even considered. She immediately made an appointment with her physician and was diagnosed with the allergy. Thanks to ChatGPT, Sarah was able to get a proper diagnosis and start treatment in time, which might not have been possible otherwise.</p>
