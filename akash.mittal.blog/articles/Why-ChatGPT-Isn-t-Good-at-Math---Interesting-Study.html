   <h2>An Investigation into The Math Skills of Artificial Intelligence Chatbot, ChatGPT</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>Imagine a student who is always keen to learn everything and anything, but he always gets low scores in math exams despite his efforts. Such a student is ChatGPT, an AI-based chatbot that can answer almost any question you throw at it, but it struggles with mathematical queries.</p>
   <p>ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, is one of the most advanced chatbots that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to interact with humans. However, when it comes to solving mathematical problems, it falls short of expectations and often gives incorrect answers.</p>
   <p>Real-life examples show that ChatGPT's math skills are far from perfect, even for simple calculations. For instance, a user once asked ChatGPT to solve "5+2*3," and it replied with 21, whereas the correct answer is 11. Another user asked it to find the square root of 256, and it answered with 16, which is incorrect.</p>
   <p>OpenAI acknowledges this limitation of ChatGPT, stating that it is designed to excel in language-related tasks, and its math capabilities are still a work in progress. Companies that use ChatGPT for customer support, such as Hugging Face and Aiva Health, have also acknowledged this issue. They admit that while ChatGPT is excellent at handling customer queries, it is not suitable for solving mathematical problems.</p>
   <p>It is important to note that ChatGPT's math skills are not a reflection of AI's ability to solve mathematical problems. Several AI-based tools and platforms, such as Wolfram Alpha, Mathway, and Symbolab, have proven to be extremely effective in solving complex math problems. It's just that ChatGPT is not among them.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, while ChatGPT excels in several areas of AI, it is not meant to be a substitute for human mathematicians or calculators. Its math capabilities are still a work in progress, and it is wise to use it only for language-based tasks. That being said, it is interesting to see how AI continues to evolve and improve in different areas, including math and language processing.</p>
