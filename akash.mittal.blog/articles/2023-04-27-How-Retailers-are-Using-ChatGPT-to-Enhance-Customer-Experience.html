  <p>As a shopping enthusiast, I always find myself in a dilemma while picking my favorite products. Whether it's a dress, a pair of shoes or electronic gadgets, I always need someone's opinion to help me make an informed decision. However, thanks to ChatGPT, retailers have made shopping a lot easier and more fun.</p>
  <p>ChatGPT is an AI-enabled chatbot that helps people pick what to buy. By asking a few questions, it can suggest the best products that match the customer's needs and preferences.</p>
  <h2>Concrete Examples</h2>
  <p>Let's say, I want to buy a dress for my friend's wedding. ChatGPT can help me pick the right dress by asking a few simple questions such as:</p>

   <li>What is the occasion?</li>
   <li>What is your budget?</li>
   <li>What is your preferred style?</li>
   <li>What is your body type?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Based on my answers, ChatGPT can show me a list of dresses that match my requirements. I can even ask it for more options or specific recommendations.</p>

  <ol>
   <li>What is your budget?</li>
   <li>Do you want to buy an iPhone or an Android?</li>
   <li>What is the screen size you prefer?</li>
   <li>What is the camera quality you are looking for?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Based on my answers, ChatGPT can suggest the best smartphone that meets all my requirements.</p>
