  <h1>The Future of Social Media: Layer 3 Network with Lens Protocol</h1> <img src="../images/Web3-Social-Media-Protocol-Lens-Launches-New-Layer-3-Network---Forbes-India.jpeg" alt="+Web3 Social Media Protocol Lens Launches New Layer 3 Network - Forbes India+">
  <p>It's 2040, and the way people interact on social media has dramatically evolved. Instead of scrolling through a feed of static posts and ads, users can enter virtual rooms, where they can engage in live conversations with like-minded individuals. These rooms are hosted on a new type of social media platform, built on the latest Web3 technologies.</p>
  <p>Users can seamlessly move between rooms and different social media platforms, all while keeping their identity and data under their control. This is made possible by a new Layer 3 network, developed by the Lens Protocol team.</p>
  <p>Lens Protocol, a decentralized social media protocol, has recently launched its new Layer 3 network, which enables cross-platform compatibility and scalability, while maintaining security and privacy. The new network is built on top of Ethereum and utilizes a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism to validate transactions.</p>
  <p>Real-life examples of Web3 social media platforms built on the Lens Protocol include:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><a href="https://www.hopin.com/">Hopin</a>, an online events platform that enables interactive experiences and connections.</li>
   <li><a href="https://rally.io/">Rally.io</a>, a creator monetization platform that empowers content creators to own and control their fan economy.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These platforms represent a new era of social media, where users are in control and can fully trust the technologies they use. As the Lens Protocol team noted, "we believe that the future of social media should be decentralized, open, and transparent, and we're committed to making that vision a reality."</p>
