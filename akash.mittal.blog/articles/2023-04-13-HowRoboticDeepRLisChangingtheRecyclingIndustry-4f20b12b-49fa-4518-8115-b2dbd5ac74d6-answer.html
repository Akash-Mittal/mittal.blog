   <p>Imagine a world where recycling plants no longer rely on human intervention to sort waste and recyclables. This is the reality in many places, thanks to advances in robotic deep reinforcement learning (RL) technology.</p>
   <p>Take, for example, the <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/robotic-deep-rl-scale-sorting-waste-recyclables-fleet-robots/">recent deployment of a fleet of robots</a> in a recycling facility in the Bay Area. These robots use machine learning algorithms to recognize and sort different types of waste, from plastics to paper to glass.</p>
   <p>The potential applications of deep RL in waste sorting are enormous. For one, it can significantly increase the efficiency of recycling plants, reduce the chances of contamination, and minimize the amount of recyclable materials sent to landfills.</p>
   <h2>Example</h2>
   <p>To truly appreciate the impact of robotic deep RL on the recycling industry, let's look at some concrete examples:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Speed of Sorting: An average waste-sorting facility processes roughly 25 tons of waste each hour. With the help of deep RL robotics, that processing can increase to over 70 tons per hour. This increase in speed would help meet the growing demand for more recycling plants and waste management facilities.</li>
    <li>Decrease in Contamination: Human error accounts for a great deal of contamination in recycling plants. When a human can't discern if an item is recyclable or not, it may end up being sent to the wrong stream. Deep RL robotics can detect and sort materials with more precision, thus reducing the incidence of contamination</li>
    <li>Less Waste sent to Landfills: Currently, contamination levels in recycling facilities can be as high as 25%, and this means that a lot of potentially recyclable materials could end up in landfills. The accuracy of deep RL robotics can significantly reduce the amount of waste that ends up there.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>Robotic deep RL is a game-changer in the waste-sorting world. The applications of this technology are already being seen in recycling facilities across the world. The benefits are clear: increased efficiency, reduction of waste, and a lower chance of contamination. These advancements are a great step towards building a more sustainable future.</p>
