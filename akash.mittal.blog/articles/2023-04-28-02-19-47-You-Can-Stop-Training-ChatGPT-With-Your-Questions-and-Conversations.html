    <p>Imagine that you have a new colleague at work, and you want to make a good first impression. You start chatting with him and asking questions about his hobbies, interests, and background. After a few minutes, you realize that he doesn't seem interested in talking to you, and he keeps giving you brief and impersonal answers.</p>
    <p>You may wonder what you did wrong, but the truth is that you were not talking to a real person. You were interacting with a machine learning model called ChatGPT, which was trained to simulate human conversation. While ChatGPT can provide useful information and solve some problems, it cannot replace the value of human interaction and empathy.</p>
    <p>For example, if you ask ChatGPT for advice on a personal matter, it may give you a generic and unhelpful response such as "just be yourself" or "follow your heart". However, a real person who knows you well and cares about your well-being can offer you more specific and tailored guidance.</p>
    <h2>Concrete Examples</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>A customer service chatbot may fail to understand and address a complex or emotional issue that a customer is facing, leading to frustration and dissatisfaction.</li>
     <li>A language learning app may teach you the grammar and vocabulary of a foreign language, but it cannot immerse you in the culture and nuances of the language.</li>
     <li>A mental health chatbot may provide some coping strategies for anxiety or depression, but it cannot replace the value of therapy and personal connection.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>While machine learning models such as ChatGPT can provide useful information and solve some problems, they cannot replace the value of human interaction and empathy.</li>
     <li>Real people who know you well and care about your well-being can offer you more specific and tailored guidance than a generic algorithm.</li>
     <li>Therefore, it's important to use chatbots and other AI tools as supplements, not substitutes, for human relationships and communication.</li>
    </ol>
