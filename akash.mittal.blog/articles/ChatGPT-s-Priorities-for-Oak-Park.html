    <h2>An Eye-Opening Incident</h2>
    <p>One fine morning, Mrs. Anderson, a senior citizen residing in Oak Park, was on her way to the nearby grocery store to buy some essentials. She had to cross a busy road to reach the store, but the pedestrian signal was not working that day. She waited for a few minutes, but no luck. Suddenly, a reckless driver zoomed in towards her direction, and in a hurry to cross the road, she started running. She did manage to cross the road, but lost her balance, fell down, and got severely injured.</p>
    <p>Incidents like this happen frequently, and this calls for the attention of ChatGPT.</p>
