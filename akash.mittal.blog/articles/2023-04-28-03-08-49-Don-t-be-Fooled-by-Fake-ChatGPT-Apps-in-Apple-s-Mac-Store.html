  <p>Are you a fan of ChatGPT, the popular AI-powered chatbot that can converse with you about almost any topic? If so, you might be tempted to download one of the ChatGPT apps in the Mac Store to have access to the chatbot directly from your macOS device. But beware! According to cybersecurity experts, there are several fake ChatGPT apps in the Mac Store that can harm your device and steal your data.</p>
  <p>One such app, called "ChatGPT for Mac", was recently discovered by cybersecurity firm Malwarebytes. The app, which was available for free, claimed to offer the same features as the official ChatGPT website, including the ability to chat with the chatbot and get answers to your questions. However, the app was actually a trojan horse that could infect your device with malware and spyware.</p>
  <p>But "ChatGPT for Mac" is not the only fake app in the Mac Store. Another app, called "ChatGPT Pro", was found to be a copycat of the official ChatGPT app for iOS, which is not available for MacOS. The app, which charged $9.99, had no functionality and simply crashed when opened.</p>
  <p>So, how can you avoid falling prey to these fake ChatGPT apps? First, make sure to check the developer's name and website before downloading any app. The official ChatGPT website is <a href="https://www.chatgpt.com/">www.chatgpt.com</a> and the company behind it is <a href="https://www.cognitivescale.com/">CognitiveScale</a>. Any other website or developer claiming to offer ChatGPT for MacOS is likely to be fake.</p>
  <p>Second, read the reviews and ratings of an app before downloading it. If an app has only a few ratings and they are all positive, it might be a fake app with fake reviews. Similarly, if an app has negative reviews that mention malware or spyware, stay away from it.</p>
  <p>Finally, always keep your Mac updated with the latest security patches and antivirus software. Even if you accidentally download a fake ChatGPT app, having a strong security system can minimize the damage.</p>
