    <p>Around 2 years ago, Sarah was scrolling through the WhatsApp messages on her friend's phone, when she came across a string of embarrassing messages she had sent to her ex-boyfriend. Sarah had forgotten all about them, and was mortified that her friend could have read them. Her friend tried to explain that she had the habit of not deleting chat histories. However, Sarah could not help but feel like her privacy had been violated.</p>
    <p>This incident is not uncommon as privacy concerns are on the rise with the increasing use of messaging apps. Companies like Facebook, WhatsApp, WeChat, and Telegram have been at the receiving end of considerable criticism over their privacy policies. Recently, ChatGPT, a relatively new AI-powered chat application, announced that it is offering its users the option to turn off their chat history. This feature has come as a boon to protect privacy and prevent embarrassing or sensitive messages from accidentally popping up.</p>
    <p>Unlike other messaging apps, ChatGPT does not rely on human operators to moderate its conversations. The AI-powered platform is aimed at language learners and offers conversations with bots programmed to speak in the target language. The app uses a blend of AI and NLP technologies to simulate natural language conversations.</p>
    <h2>Real-life Examples</h2>
    <p>Many celebrities, politicians, and officials have also fallen into trouble over their leaked chat histories. In 2018, WhatsApp messaging logs were illegally accessed and leaked to the press in India, which had led to mob lynching incidents. In 2020, several Indian politicians' WhatsApp chats were leaked, revealing their internal discussions on sensitive matters.</p>
    <p>This is not limited to India alone. In 2020, hackers stole and leaked the private messages of celebrities such as Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates from Twitter.</p>
