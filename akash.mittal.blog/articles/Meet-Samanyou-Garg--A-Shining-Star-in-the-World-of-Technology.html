    <h2>The Journey of Samanyou Garg</h2>
    <p>Samanyou Garg is a young entrepreneur hailing from New Delhi, India. His passion for technology started when he was just a teenager, experimenting with coding on his computer. He pursued his interest in technology by studying Computer Science and Engineering at the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi.</p>
    <p>After completing his studies, Garg started his career at Oracle, where he worked on database systems and cloud computing. However, his real entrepreneurial journey started when he co-founded the startup 'SqrFactor' in 2014. SqrFactor aimed to provide a platform for student housing in India, where usually students struggle to find good accommodation.</p>
    <p>Although the startup didn't succeed, Garg did not give up. He moved on to co-found another startup named 'ZunRoof', which provides solar energy solutions to Indian homes. Today, ZunRoof is one of the leading solar energy companies in India, with over 10,000 installs and a revenue of over $1 million. Garg's innovative idea has helped millions of people in India to implement eco-friendly ways of living.</p>
