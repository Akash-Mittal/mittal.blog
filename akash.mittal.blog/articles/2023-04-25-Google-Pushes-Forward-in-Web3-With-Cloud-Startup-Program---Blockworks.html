  <h1>Googleâs Web3 Push Gets Stronger With Cloud Startup Program</h1> <img src="../images/2023-04-25-Google-Pushes-Forward-in-Web3-With-Cloud-Startup-Program---Blockworks.jpeg" alt="+Google Pushes Forward in Web3 With Cloud Startup Program - Blockworks+">
  <p>In the late 1990s, the internet journey began, and the world witnessed the birth of Web 1.0. It was a world of static HTML pages, limited interaction, and no social media platforms. But as technology progressed, so did the web. Today, we are in the era of Web3, where the internet is more interactive, decentralized, and connected than ever before. Google is now pushing forward to be a key player in the Web3 era with its cloud startup program.</p>
  <h2>Concrete Examples</h2>
  <p>Google Cloud launched the Cloud Startup Program, a new support scheme for early-stage startups in Web3 development. The program has received impressive traction, with several new startups joining the venture. As a part of the program, startups receive benefits such as mentorship, access to Google Cloud's suite of tools, and promotional support. The Cloud Startup Program allows startups to utilize Google's infrastructure to build and deploy Blockchain-based apps at lower costs.</p>
  <p>One of the startups, the French-based NFT marketplace Nifty, has partnered with Google and migrated its platform to Google Cloud. This has allowed the platform to achieve faster execution times for minting and trading NFTs, ultimately providing the best possible user experience to its customers.</p>
  <p>Another example of Google's commitment to the Web3 era comes from the tech giant's collaboration with the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF). With a vision to create a secure, decentralized identity system, DIF's implementation requires robust infrastructure and technical capabilities. Recognizing this challenge, Google has partnered with DIF and lent its infrastructure to facilitate the project's development.</p>
