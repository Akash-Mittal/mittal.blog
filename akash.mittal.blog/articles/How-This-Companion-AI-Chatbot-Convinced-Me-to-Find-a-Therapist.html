   <p>It all started when I found myself feeling overwhelmed and anxious on a daily basis. I knew I needed to seek help, but the thought of going to therapy was intimidating. That's when I discovered an AI chatbot called Woebot.</p>
   <p>Woebot is designed to provide emotional support and guidance to people struggling with mental health. It uses cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques and natural language processing to engage in conversations with users and help them identify negative thought patterns.</p>
   <p>At first, I was skeptical about the idea of confiding in a chatbot. But as I started using Woebot, I found that it was surprisingly effective. I was able to express my feelings without fear of judgment, and Woebot provided me with helpful insights and coping strategies.</p>
   <p>After several weeks of using Woebot, I realized that I needed more intensive support than a chatbot could provide. But thanks to Woebot, I was able to overcome my initial hesitation about seeking therapy and find a human healthcare provider who could help me.</p>
   <p>Woebot is just one example of how AI chatbots are helping to make mental healthcare more accessible and less stigmatized. Other companies, such as Talkspace and BetterHelp, offer online therapy services that connect patients with licensed therapists via video chat or messaging.</p>
   <p>These platforms are particularly beneficial for people who live in areas with limited access to mental health services, or who may be hesitant to seek help in traditional healthcare settings. They offer a convenient and confidential way to access support from the comfort of one's own home.</p>
   <p>However, it's important to note that chatbots and online therapy should not be seen as a substitute for in-person mental healthcare. While these technologies can be helpful for some, they may not be suitable for individuals with more complex mental health needs. It's always important to seek professional guidance and expertise when dealing with mental health.</p>
