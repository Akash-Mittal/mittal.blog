    <p>Once upon a time, there was a company that wanted to incorporate artificial intelligence into their products. They had data scientists and software developers, but they realized they needed a specialist who could bridge the gap between the two fields. That's when they hired a machine learning engineer.</p>
    <p>A machine learning engineer is responsible for designing and implementing systems that can learn from and make predictions on data. They work closely with data scientists to understand the algorithms they develop and with software developers to integrate those algorithms into applications.</p>
    <p>Many companies are now recognizing the importance of machine learning engineers, and the demand for this role is growing rapidly. In fact, according to Glassdoor, machine learning engineering is one of the top emerging jobs in the US with a median salary of $141,000.</p>
    <h2>Real Life Examples</h2>
    <p>Let's look at some examples of companies that have hired machine learning engineers to build AI solutions.</p>
    <ul>
     <li><a href="https://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a> is using machine learning to personalize recommendations for their users. They hired machine learning engineers to design and implement the algorithms that power their recommendation system.</li>
     <li><a href="https://www.tesla.com/">Tesla</a> is using machine learning to improve the safety and efficiency of their autonomous driving technology. They hired machine learning engineers to develop and train the algorithms that enable their cars to make decisions on the road.</li>
     <li><a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson">IBM Watson</a> is a platform that uses machine learning to analyze and understand natural language. IBM hired machine learning engineers to develop the algorithms that enable Watson to understand and process human speech.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, machine learning engineers are becoming an essential part of AI solutions group. The demand for this role is growing rapidly as companies seek to incorporate more artificial intelligence into their products. By working closely with data scientists and software developers, machine learning engineers are able to design and implement systems that can learn from data and make predictions. This is an exciting time for those interested in machine learning and AI, and the opportunities for this field will only continue to grow.</p>
