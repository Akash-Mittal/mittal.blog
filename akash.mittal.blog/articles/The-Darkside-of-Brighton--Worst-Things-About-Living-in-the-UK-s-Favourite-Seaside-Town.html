    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Brighton is a beautiful seaside town located in the south of England. Known for its vibrant atmosphere, rich history, and picturesque surroundings, Brighton has become a favourite destination for tourists and locals alike. Despite its many charms, living in Brighton can come with its own set of challenges. In this article, we explore some of the worst things about living in Brighton.</p>

   <section id="2">
    <h2>Cost of Living</h2>
    <p>Brighton has one of the highest cost of livings in the country, with rent prices far exceeding the national average. For example, a one-bedroom flat in the city centre can cost anywhere between Â£800 to Â£1200 per month. This high cost of living can make it challenging for many people, especially young professionals and students, to make ends meet.</p>
    <p>One example of a high-cost establishment in Brighton is the popular restaurant, The Ivy. With its opulent dÃ©cor and celebrity clients, The Ivy is a go-to destination for many tourists and locals alike. However, with prices averaging around Â£40 per main course, itâ??s not a place that many residents can afford to dine at regularly.</p>

    <h2>Unsustainable Tourism</h2>
    <p>Brighton welcomes millions of visitors each year, generating billions in revenue for its local economy. While the tourism industry is vital for the townâ??s economy, it can lead to overcrowding, environmental damage, and pressure on public services. This tension is particularly felt during the peak summer season when the town swells with visitors.</p>
    <p>One company that has been criticised for its impact on Brightonâ??s environment is the British Airways i360. The 162-metre observation tower offers views across the town, but it has also been criticised for its significant energy consumption and carbon footprint. Furthermore, the towerâ??s futuristic design has been a subject of controversy, with some locals arguing that it is an eyesore that does not fit in with Brightonâ??s historical aesthetic.</p>

    <h2>Housing Crisis</h2>
    <p>The high cost of living in Brighton has contributed to a housing crisis, with many young people and families struggling to find affordable housing. This has led to a rise in homelessness and a growing gap between the rich and poor.</p>
    <p>One example of a company contributing to Brightonâ??s housing crisis is Southern Housing Group. Some Brighton residents have accused the housing association of neglecting their properties, leading to poor living conditions and overpriced rent. Furthermore, Southern Housing Group was involved in a controversial deal with Brighton &amp; Hove City council to build 216 affordable homes and 201 luxury flats on land earmarked for social housing. This deal was criticised by some as prioritising profit over the needs of the local community.</p>

It is up to the townâ??s local government, businesses, and communities to come up with sustainable solutions to these problems.</p>
