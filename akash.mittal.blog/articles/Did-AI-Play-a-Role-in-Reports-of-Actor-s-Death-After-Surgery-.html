   <h2>An Investigation into the Use of AI in Cosmetology</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>Reports circulating in the media recently claimed that a Hollywood actor died following surgery to look more Korean. However, upon closer inspection, it is unclear whether this story is true, or whether it was a hoax perpetuated by news outlets attempting to capitalize on the growing trend of AI-driven cosmetic procedures.</p>
   <p>The use of artificial intelligence in beauty treatments has skyrocketed in recent years, with companies like Face++ and Perfect Corp. offering software that can simulate treatments and predicted outcomes before any actual work is done on a client's face.</p>
   <p>While these tools can help increase the accuracy and effectiveness of cosmetic procedures, they also raise a number of ethical concerns around body modification and cultural appropriation.</p>
   <p>For example, some critics have argued that using AI to "transform" one's appearance to look more like a member of another race is not only culturally insensitive, but also reinforces harmful stereotypes and a narrow definition of beauty.</p>
   <p>Others have pointed out that the use of AI in cosmetology could lead to a world where people are judged not only by their physical appearance, but also by the algorithms and data sets that govern how they look.</p>
   <p>Despite these concerns, the market for AI-powered cosmetic treatments continues to grow, and it remains to be seen what effects this trend will have on the beauty industry as a whole.</p>
