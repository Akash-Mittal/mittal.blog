    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>Bitget, a leading digital asset trading platform, has recently launched its Web3 fund, joining the growing list of exchanges that are venturing into the Web3 space.</p>
    <p>The Web3 fund is specifically designed to invest in Web3 infrastructure projects, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). With the increasing popularity of Web3, Bitget's move is seen as a strategic one as it aims to capture a portion of this emerging market.</p>
    <p>The exchange also revealed its plans to acquire a license to operate in Hong Kong, which is seen as a major step forward in its expansion plans.</p>
    <h2>Real life examples</h2>
    <p>The launch of Bitget's Web3 fund is a significant development in a rapidly evolving industry. Other exchanges such as Binance, Huobi, and OKEx have also launched their own Web3 funds to capitalize on the growing demand for such investments.</p>
    <p>Web3 infrastructure projects such as Polkadot, Solana, and Cosmos have seen a surge in demand as investors recognize the potential of this emerging space. Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols such as Aave, Uniswap, and Compound have also gained popularity for their ability to provide access to financial services without the need for intermediaries. On the other hand, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have revolutionized the art world by allowing creators to monetize their digital creations, resulting in multi-million dollar sales.</p>
