    <p>Elizabeth, a Twitter user, had been struggling to find a job for months. She had sent her CV to multiple companies but was disappointed as she never heard back from any of them. One day, she stumbled upon a website called ChatGPT.</p>
    <p>Curious, she decided to try it out. ChatGPT is an AI-powered chatbot that helps job seekers apply for jobs by asking them questions to fill out their CVs. Elizabeth found the platform very user-friendly and applied for multiple jobs using it.</p>
    <p>To her surprise, she started getting responses from the companies she had applied to through ChatGPT. Elizabeth secured multiple interviews and ended up getting a job offer she was thrilled about.</p>
    <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
    <p>Elizabeth's story is not unique. Many job seekers have found success using ChatGPT. One of the most notable examples is Microsoft. The tech giant has been using a chatbot to screen job applicants since 2016. The chatbot asks applicants questions about their skills and experience and then ranks them accordingly.</p>
    <p>Another example is Unilever. The consumer goods company launched an AI-powered recruitment process to streamline its hiring process. The chatbot asks candidates multiple-choice questions and evaluates their responses. Candidates who pass this first round are then interviewed by a human recruiter.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>AI-powered chatbots are a game-changer for job applications, streamlining the process and increasing the chances of securing an interview.</li>
     <li>Companies like Microsoft and Unilever have already started using chatbots to screen job applicants, and others are sure to follow suit.</li>
     <li>The rise of AI chatbots could have implications for human recruiters, as more and more companies turn to this technology to handle recruitment.</li>
