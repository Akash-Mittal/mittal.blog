    <h2>An Interesting Story</h2>
    <p>Imagine a world where file storage and sharing was only possible via emails or physical transfers. It was a tedious and time-consuming process, but that's how things were before Dropbox came into existence. The cloud storage giant quickly became the go-to platform for individuals and businesses to store their data securely and share it with others. However, even the best companies face challenges, and Dropbox is not an exception.</p>

    <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
    <p>Dropbox is laying off 11% of its workforce i.e. around 500 employees as part of its restructuring plan. The company is looking to cut costs and redirect their focus towards Artificial Intelligence (AI). Dropbox CEO Drew Houston stated that "we'll be creating a new operating model and a more efficient, nimble company." The two main areas where Dropbox is looking to invest more are Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Houston believes that "AI will be a driving force behind Dropbox's future growth."</p>
    <p>Dropbox is not alone in this pivot towards AI. Many companies such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are investing heavily in AI technologies. For example, Google's DeepMind is already making waves in the healthcare industry by accurately predicting kidney injury.</p>
    <p>Another example of the use of AI is from Amazon. The company has recently introduced its "Amazon Go" stores that use AI to track the items picked up by customers, eliminating the need for checkouts. The stores use sensors and cameras to identify the items, charge the customer's account, and send a receipt. The future of retail is an example of how AI can help businesses revolutionize their industry.</p>
