   <h2>An Interesting Story</h2>
   <p>It was the winter of 2018, and a small startup in Silicon Valley was working on a revolutionary idea that would change the world forever. They called it a "quantum computer", and it promised to solve complex problems that would take decades or even centuries to solve on traditional computers. The startup received funding from some of the biggest venture capitalists in the industry, and soon enough, they had a prototype ready for testing.</p>
   <p>Their first experiment was to predict the stock market. They fed historical data into the quantum computer and waited for the results. To their surprise, the quantum computer accurately predicted the stock market movements for the next six months with an astonishing 95% accuracy. The world was in shock, and the startup became the talk of the town overnight.</p>
   <h2>Real Life Examples</h2>
   <p>Since that fateful day in 2018, many companies have been using technology to predict the future. Take, for instance, Google's "predictive search". When you start typing a search query, Google tries to predict what you're looking for and finishes the search for you. This technology has been around for over a decade and is now a standard feature in all search engines.</p>
   <p>Another example is Amazon's "predictive shipping". Amazon uses machine learning algorithms to determine which products you're most likely to buy and ship them to a nearby warehouse before you even make the purchase. This allows them to deliver products faster than ever before and is one of the reasons why Amazon is the biggest online retailer in the world today.</p>
   <h2>Main Companies (with hyperlinks)</h2>
   <p>Some of the biggest companies that are using technology to predict the future today are:</p>
   <ol>
    <li><a href="https://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a></li>
   </ol>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, technology has come a long way in predicting the future. From small startups to big corporations, everyone is using technology to get a glimpse of what's to come. However, with great power comes great responsibility, and we must use these technologies wisely. The future is bright, and technology is shaping it in ways we could have never imagined.</p>
   <ol>
    <li>We must be cautious about how we use predictive technology</li>
    <li>The future holds endless possibilities with technology</li>
    <li>Technology is changing the way we think about the future</li>
   </ol>
