   <p>Imagine you're buying a new house and spend countless hours pouring over listings, driving by open houses, and scheduling viewing appointments. But what if there was a tool that could do all that for you, saving you time and effort? That's what Davina, an AI-powered virtual assistant, can do. Davina extracts real-time data from thousands of sources, filters through them, and identifies properties that match your preferences, complete with 3D tours and virtual reality walk-throughs.</p>
   <p>However, there has been an increase in concern over the use of AI models that aren't transparent, such as facial recognition technology. That's why the UK Government has launched a review of AI models, including Davina and its competitors like ChatGPT. The goal is to ensure that AI models are transparent and trustworthy.</p>
   <p>Real-life examples of AI models that have caused controversy include IBM's facial recognition software, which has been criticized for being racially biased. Another example is the use of AI algorithms in recruitment that have been found to discriminate against certain groups of people.</p>
   <p>ChatGPT, an AI model developed by OpenAI, has also raised concerns over the quality and accuracy of its responses. In one test, ChatGPT displayed harmful biases towards women and people of color.</p>
   <p>The UK Government's review will examine the use of these AI models in various industries, including healthcare, finance, and education, to ensure that they are being used in an ethical and trustworthy manner.</p>
   <p>Some of the main companies involved in the review include OpenAI, IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon. These companies have been heavily investing in AI technology and have a significant impact on the industry and the public's perception of the technology.</p>
   <h2>Implications of the Review</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>The review could lead to increased transparency and accountability in the use of AI models, which would benefit consumers and businesses alike.</li>
    <li>Companies that are found to be using AI models in an unethical manner could face consequences such as fines or legal action.</li>
    <li>The review could also lead to the development of new standards and regulations for the use of AI models, which would provide clarity and guidance to businesses using these technologies.</li>
