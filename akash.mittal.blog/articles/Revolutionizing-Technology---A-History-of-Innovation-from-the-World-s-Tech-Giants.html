    <p>It all started in 1976, when a group of young entrepreneurs founded Apple Inc. in a small garage in California. Their vision was to create a computer that could be used by everyone. And they succeeded beyond their wildest dreams.</p>
    <p>Now, more than four decades later, Apple is one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a market capitalization of over $2 trillion. And their impact on the world of technology cannot be overstated.</p>
    <p>But Apple is not the only tech giant that has revolutionized the world. There are many other companies that have made significant contributions to the field of technology, from Microsoft to Google to Amazon.</p>
    <p>Microsoft, founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen, is a company that needs no introduction. They have played a major role in developing and popularizing the personal computer, and their software products like Windows and Office are used by millions of people around the world.</p>
    <p>Google, on the other hand, has transformed the way we access information. Founded in 1998, they quickly became the world's most popular search engine, and have since expanded into a wide range of products and services, from email to online advertising to cloud computing.</p>
    <p>And who could forget about Amazon? Founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos, they started off as an online bookstore, but have since grown into the world's largest online retailer, as well as a major player in the cloud computing industry.</p>
    <p>These are just a few examples of the many tech giants that have changed the world with their innovations. And the pace of technological change shows no signs of slowing down. With the rise of artificial intelligence, blockchain, and other cutting-edge technologies, it's clear that the world of technology will continue to evolve in ways that we can't even imagine.</p>
