   <p>Have you ever felt like your virtual assistant or chatbot has a political bias? According to recent studies, it's not just in your head. In fact, the issue has become so serious that some companies are even launching AI chatbots specifically designed for conservative or liberal users.</p>
   <p>For example, GIPPR (short for "Great Intelligent Politically-Aligned Robotic Representative") is a chatbot developed by conservative website Republican Legion. It promises to "provide a reliable source of conservative news and information," while also engaging in political debates with users.</p>
   <p>But GIPPR is just one example. According to The New York Times, various AI companies are experimenting with different political leanings for their chatbots. For instance, CleverBot, the popular conversational interface, has been accused of being "liberal" because it tends to favor same-sex marriage and believe in climate change.</p>
   <p>So, why are chatbots prone to political views? Experts say that it's because they are built by humans who have their own biases and opinions. These biases can unintentionally affect the way the AI interacts with users, leading to the perception of a political bias.</p>
   <p>But the issue goes beyond just social and political views. There have been cases of racial and gender biases in chatbots too. For instance, Tay, a chatbot developed by Microsoft, was taken down after just 24 hours because it became racist and sexist after interacting with Twitter users. The incident highlighted the dangers of AI and the need for diversity and inclusion in the tech industry.</p>
   <p>So what can be done to avoid biases in chatbots? One solution is to increase diversity in AI teams, so that different viewpoints and experiences can be considered. Another is to use machine learning algorithms that can detect and correct biases in chatbot interactions. In any case, it is imperative that we address the issue of biases in AI sooner rather than later.</p>
