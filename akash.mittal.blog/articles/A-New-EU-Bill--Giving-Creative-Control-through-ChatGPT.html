   <p>Have you ever been frustrated by seeing your work being used or shared without your permission? As a creative person, you understand the importance of protecting your artwork or literary works from illegal usage. Fortunately, the European Union (EU) is taking creative control to the next level through ChatGPT technology.</p>
   <h2>What is ChatGPT?</h2>
   <p>ChatGPT is a conversational artificial intelligence (AI) developed by OpenAI. It uses deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) to generate human-like responses to given texts or prompts. In other words, it can understand and interpret natural language to create meaningful and relevant outputs.</p>
   <h2>How does EU empower creatives through ChatGPT?</h2>
   <p>The EU has introduced a new bill that mandates all online platforms to adopt ChatGPT as a form of copyright enforcement. The idea is to allow creatives to have more control over their work by detecting and reporting copyright infringement more efficiently. With ChatGPT's advanced NLP capabilities, it can easily identify and flag down works that are similar to the original, even if they are slightly altered or modified.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, the bill also makes it mandatory for platforms to provide proper attribution for any creative work used. This means that if an online platform uses a copyrighted work, they must credit the creator and provide a link to their portfolio or website. This move not only empowers creatives but also helps them gain more recognition and exposure for their work.</p>
   <h2>Real-life Examples</h2>
   <p>One of the major companies that could be affected by this bill is YouTube. According to a study by Incopro, a digital brand protection firm, more than 80% of YouTube channels have at least one video that infringes on copyrighted material. With ChatGPT's implementation, YouTube could better monitor and remove infringing content more efficiently, giving more control to the original creators.</p>
   <p>Another example is the photo-sharing platform, Instagram. While Instagram already has a system that flags copyrighted materials, ChatGPT could improve its accuracy and reduce the time taken to process requests for takedown notices. This means that creatives can have more confidence in sharing their works on the platform, knowing that they have more control over the usage of their works.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>The EU's new bill on ChatGPT technology provides more creative control to original creators.</li>
    <li>Platforms like YouTube and Instagram could be positively affected by ChatGPT's implementation.</li>
    <li>Providing proper attribution for copyrighted materials could provide more recognition and exposure for creators.</li>
   </ul>
