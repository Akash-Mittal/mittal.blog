    <p>Imagine you're chatting with your friend on ChatGPT. You share your thoughts and feelings about your day, your family, your work, and more. But do you know who else might be reading your messages? Hackers, cybercriminals, and even the government can intercept your chat conversations and spy on your online activity without your knowledge.</p>
    <h2>Real Life Examples</h2>
    <p>Recently, the popular chat app WhatsApp was in the spotlight for a major security breach. Hackers were able to install spyware on users' phones simply by making a voice call to them. This gave the hackers access to all the data on the phone, including chat messages, photos, and contacts. The attack affected more than 1.5 billion users worldwide.</p>
    <p>Another example is the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where millions of Facebook users' personal data was harvested without their consent and used to influence the 2016 US presidential election. The data was obtained through a quiz app that users had given permission to access their information, but the app also collected data from their friends without their knowledge.</p>
