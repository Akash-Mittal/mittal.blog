   <p>The other day, my friend Tom received a message on his ChatGPT account. It was from a stranger - a woman with a gorgeous profile picture and a message that said "Hey, Tom. I am particularly interested in you, do you want to chat?". Tom, being the nice guy that he is, replied and they started to chat. However, something didn't feel right. The stranger seemed off-topic and kept insisting that Tom should click on a link that was sent to him. Tom hesitated for a moment but eventually clicked on it. And that was when the trouble started. His computer was infected with malware that caused him to lose data and access to his ChatGPT account.</p>
   <p>Tom's experience is not isolated. Meta, the parent company of ChatGPT, has released a statement saying that ChatGPT related malware is on the rise. This news is particularly alarming as more and more people worldwide are relying on chat applications to keep in touch with friends and family.</p>
   <p>In a study conducted by cybersecurity firm Bitdefender, it was found that malicious attacks on chat applications increased by 48% in 2020. In this article, we will delve into the problem of ChatGPT related malware and provide some real-life examples of how they operate.</p>
   <h2>What is ChatGPT Related Malware?</h2>
   <p>ChatGPT related malware refers to malicious software that is specifically designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the ChatGPT application. It can be in the form of a virus, trojan, worm, or any other type of malware. These malicious programs are designed to infect a user's device and disrupt the normal functioning of the device, often with the ultimate objective of stealing sensitive information such as bank details or usernames and passwords.</p>
   <h2>Real-life Examples</h2>
   <p>One of the most common ways ChatGPT malware works is through phishing attacks. Attackers create fake profiles to lure unsuspecting users into clicking on links, downloading files, or providing personal information. Hackers can also use ChatGPT malware to set up a command-and-control server, giving them access to a user's device. One example of a ChatGPT malware attack is the infamous "Facebook Messenger virus," which was designed to steal user credentials and spread malware across the chat platform.</p>
   <h2>What is Being Done to Combat ChatGPT Related Malware?</h2>
   <p>ChatGPT parent company Meta is aware of the problem and has taken several steps to protect users from malware attacks. In addition to frequently updating the application to patch known vulnerabilities, ChatGPT also provides users with detailed instructions on how to avoid malware attacks. These instructions include:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Do not click on links that come from unknown sources</li>
    <li>Do not download files from unknown sources</li>
    <li>Do not provide personal information to unknown sources</li>
    <li>Use strong passwords</li>
    <li>Install antivirus software</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Critical Analysis</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>The rise of ChatGPT related malware is a reflection of the growing trend of cybercrime. As more people become connected online, hackers are finding new ways to exploit vulnerabilities and cause harm.</li>
    <li>Users should take responsibility for their own online security. By following the instructions provided by ChatGPT, users can avoid many of the common traps that hackers use to spread malware.</li>
    <li>Meta should continue to take an active role in combating ChatGPT related malware. This includes investing in cybersecurity measures such as threat intelligence, security operations, and incident response.</li>
