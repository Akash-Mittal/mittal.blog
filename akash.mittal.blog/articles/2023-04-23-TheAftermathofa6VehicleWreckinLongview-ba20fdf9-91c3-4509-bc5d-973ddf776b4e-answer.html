   <p>It was a typical Monday morning rush hour when it happened. Six vehicles collided on a busy Longview road, leaving three people injured and in need of hospitalization. One driver was reportedly driving under the influence, while another was distracted by their phone. The others were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, this kind of situation happens more often than we'd like to admit. Car accidents are the leading cause of death for Americans aged 1-54, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In 2019 alone, there were an estimated 38,800 deaths due to car crashes in the US.</p>
   <p>However, there are concrete steps we can take to reduce the number of accidents on our roads:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Drive sober and never get behind the wheel under the influence of drugs or alcohol.</li>
    <li>Avoid distractions such as texting, eating, drinking, or adjusting the radio while driving.</li>
    <li>Obey traffic laws, including speed limits, yield signs, and stop signs.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>By taking these measures, we can make our roads safer for ourselves and others. Accidents like the one in Longview may still occur, but we can minimize their frequency and severity.</p>
