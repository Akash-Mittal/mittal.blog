    <h2>The Story of Digital Transformation</h2>
    <p>Back in 2008, the world was hit by a financial crisis that left many companies struggling to survive. Some businesses didn't make it through the recession, while others were able to bounce back by embracing digital transformation.</p>
    <p>Companies that invested in digital technologies were able to streamline their operations, improve customer experiences and gain a competitive edge. They recognized that the future of business was digital, and they were willing to adapt.</p>
    <p>Fast forward to 2021, and digital transformation is now a necessity rather than an option. The global pandemic has accelerated the shift towards digital technologies, as companies have had to adapt to remote working and online business models.</p>
