   <h2>The Story</h2>
   <p>Suhas, the character played by actor Rajeev Ravindranathan in the Bollywood blockbuster 3 Idiots, recently received an apology from the internet. The apology came after thousands of social media users criticized Suhas for being a stereotypical representation of South Indians. The character was seen as nerdy, uncool, and obsessed with academics.</p>
   <h2>Concrete Examples</h2>
   <p>The backlash against Suhas was so intense that Rajeev himself took to Twitter to defend his character. He pointed out that Suhas was not intended to represent all South Indians and that he was simply playing a character with his own quirks and flaws. Several prominent personalities also came out in support of Rajeev, including director Anurag Kashyap and actor Riteish Deshmukh.</p>
   <p>As the controversy continued to grow, the internet finally apologized to Rajeev for the misunderstanding. Social media users began sharing memes and posts in support of Suhas, recognizing that the character was much more than simply a stereotype. The apology was a reflection of how the internet has the ability to both criticize and correct itself when necessary.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion: 3 Key Points</h2>

    <li>Characters in movies should not be seen as representative of entire communities.</li>
    <li>Stereotypes are harmful and can be challenged through dialogue and discussion.</li>
