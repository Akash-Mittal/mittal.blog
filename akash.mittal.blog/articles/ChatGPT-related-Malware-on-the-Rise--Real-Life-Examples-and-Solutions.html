    <h2>An Interesting Story</h2>
    <p>Monica, a young working professional, had recently started using a popular chat app called ChatGPT. She loved its user-friendly interface and the convenience it offered to chat with her friends and colleagues. One day, she received a message from a contact she did not recognize. The message contained a link to a website offering free movie downloads. Monica was excited to check it out, but as soon as she clicked on the link, her phone started behaving erratically. It froze, rebooted, and when finally turned back on, she realized that all her contacts, messages, and even some of her work data were deleted.</p>
