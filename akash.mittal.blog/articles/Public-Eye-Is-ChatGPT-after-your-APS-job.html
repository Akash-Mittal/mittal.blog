    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Imagine applying for a job and being interviewed by a chatbot. This is now a possibility in the Australian Public Service (APS), thanks to ChatGPT. The AI-enabled chatbot can ask interview questions, assess candidates' responses and even provide feedback. While this may seem like a convenient and efficient way to recruit new staff, it has raised concerns about the impact on APS jobs.</p>

   <section id="examples">
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>One example of ChatGPT being used in APS recruitment is the Department of Finance, which used it as part of their graduate recruitment process in 2020. Another example is the Australian Taxation Office, which is using ChatGPT to assist with their call centre enquiries. However, the introduction of ChatGPT has not been without controversy. The Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU) has raised concerns about the potential loss of jobs as a result of the AI-enabled chatbot. The CPSU argues that chatbots cannot replace the human touch and that they may overlook candidates who are better suited to the job but may not perform well in a chatbot interview.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, supporters of ChatGPT argue that it can help reduce bias in the recruitment process and allow for more consistent and objective assessments of candidates.</p>
