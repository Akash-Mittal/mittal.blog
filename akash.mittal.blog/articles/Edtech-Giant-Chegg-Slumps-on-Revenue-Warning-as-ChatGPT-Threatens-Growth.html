    <p>Imagine you are a college student facing a difficult math problem that you cannot solve. You reach out to your professor, but he is unavailable. What do you do?</p>
    <p>In the past, your only option would have been to struggle through the problem on your own. But with the rise of edtech companies like Chegg and ChatGPT, students now have access to online tutoring and homework help at their fingertips.</p>
    <p>Chegg, a well-known name in the edtech industry, has been providing students with textbook rentals, online courses, and tutoring services for over a decade. However, the company recently announced a revenue warning that caused its stock to plummet. This warning was due to the increased competition from newer edtech startups, such as ChatGPT.</p>
    <p>ChatGPT is an AI-powered platform that provides students with personalized learning experiences. The platform uses natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to understand a student's individual learning style and provide them with content tailored to their needs. This personalized approach has attracted a large number of students and threatens to disrupt the edtech industry as we know it.</p>
    <p>Real-life examples of the impact of these companies can be seen in the lives of students who have used their services. One student, Jennifer, used Chegg's tutoring service to help her understand a difficult math concept that she had been struggling with for weeks. With the help of the tutor, she was able to ace the exam and improve her GPA.</p>
    <p>Another student, Tom, began using ChatGPT's platform to study for a standardized test. The platform was able to identify his weak areas and provide him with targeted practice questions and videos. He went on to score in the 90th percentile on the test and was accepted into his dream college.</p>
    <p>While Chegg and ChatGPT both offer valuable services to students, they differ in their approaches. Chegg has a more traditional tutoring model, where students work one-on-one with a tutor. ChatGPT uses AI to provide personalized learning experiences.</p>
    <p>It remains to be seen how the competition between these edtech giants will play out. But for students, the rise of these companies means that help is always just a click away.</p>
