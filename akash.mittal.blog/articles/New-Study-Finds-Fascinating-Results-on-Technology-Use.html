   <p>Once upon a time, there was a man named John who loved to play videogames. He would spend hours on end, sometimes even skipping meals and sleep just to finish a game. His family and friends often worried about him, but he brushed off their concerns, saying that it was just a harmless hobby.</p>
   <p>Little did John know, his excessive technology use was taking a toll on his mental and physical health. According to a new research study, people who spend a lot of time using technology, such as computers, smartphones, and videogames, are more likely to experience anxiety, depression, and other health problems.</p>
   <p>The study, conducted by the research firm TechInsights, surveyed over 1,000 adults who use technology on a regular basis. The results showed that 84% of the respondents experienced some form of health issue related to technology use. Some of the most common issues included eye strain, back pain, and sleep disorders.</p>
   <p>However, the study also found that there are some companies that are taking steps to combat these issues. For example, Microsoft has created a feature called "Focus Assist" that allows users to block out distractions while they work. Apple has implemented a similar feature called "Do Not Disturb" that mutes notifications and alerts.</p>
   <p>Another company that is making a difference is Fitbit, which creates wearable technology that helps people track their physical activity and sleep patterns. By encouraging users to be more active and get better sleep, Fitbit is helping to combat the negative effects of technology use.</p>
   <p>Overall, the study's findings highlight the importance of being mindful of how much time we spend using technology, and taking steps to reduce our use. While technology can be a useful tool, it is important to remember that excessive use can have negative consequences on our health and well-being.</p>
