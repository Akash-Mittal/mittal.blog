  <h2>The Problem: Identifying Cancer Cells</h2>
  <p>Meet Dr. Sarah, a pathologist who's spent years studying cancer cells. She's seen hundreds of thousands of samples, but even with her experience, it can be hard to identify all the cancerous cells in a given image. Precision is crucialâ€”missing even one cancer cell can have catastrophic consequences for a patient.</p>
  <p>That's where deep learning comes in. By analyzing millions of images, deep learning algorithms can pick up on subtle differences that humans may miss, leading to more accurate diagnoses.</p><!-- Examples Section -->
  <h2></h2>
  <p>Deep learning has already made significant strides in the pathology world. For example:</p><!-- Example 1 -->
  <h3>Breast Cancer Diagnosis</h3>
  <p>Researchers at Google developed a deep learning model capable of identifying breast cancer tumors better than human experts. By training the model on thousands of images, it achieved 89% accuracy in diagnosing tumors with just a single image. This could greatly improve breast cancer screening programs and save countless lives.</p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Radiology_AI_Header.max-1300x1300.jpg" alt="Google's deep learning model in action"> <!-- Example 2 -->
  <h3>Lung Cancer Detection</h3>
  <p>Another study used deep learning to analyze CT scans in order to diagnose lung cancer. The model was able to detect cancerous nodules with 94% accuracy, compared to just 65% for human radiologists. Additionally, the model was able to identify nodules up to a year earlier than humans could, giving patients a better chance at recovery.</p><img src="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0447-x/figures/2" alt="Deep learning model diagnosing lung cancer"> <!-- Conclusion Section -->
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The potential for deep learning in pathology is enormous. By analyzing vast amounts of data and detecting patterns that go unnoticed by humans, deep learning models can transform the way doctors diagnose and treat disease. Here are just a few key takeaways:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Deep learning can help identify cancer cells and diagnose diseases earlier and more accurately than traditional methods.</li>
   <li>Deep learning requires large amounts of data to train models, but can achieve superior results.</li>
   <li>The future of pathology lies in a combination of human expertise and AI-powered tools.</li>
