   <p>Are you tired of seeing Snapchat's My AI in your chat feed? Do you find it annoying and intrusive? If yes, then you are not alone. Many Snapchat users feel the same way and want to remove the feature from their feed.</p>
   <p>My AI is a personal assistant feature that Snapchat introduced to help users with scheduling, recommendations, and other tasks. Although the idea behind the feature is useful, it can be distracting and overwhelming. Therefore, it is best to remove it from your chat feed altogether.</p>

    <li><strong>The distraction factor:</strong> My AI can be distracting, and it puts unnecessary notifications on your feed. These notifications can interfere with your messaging and can disrupt the conversations you are having with your friends.</li>
    <li><strong>The overwhelming nature:</strong> My AI can overwhelm you with too much information, which can be confusing and frustrating. The feature provides recommendations for things like restaurants, movies, and events. However, not all of these recommendations are relevant to you, and it can be challenging to sift through them all.</li>
    <li><strong>The privacy concerns:</strong> My AI collects data about your conversations and uses them to provide personalized recommendations. Although Snapchat says that this data is secure, some users are uncomfortable with the idea of the app collecting their information.</li>
   </ol>
