   <p>"I understand real fear now." That's what Henry Cavill, the lead actor of 'The Witcher' said in a recently released teaser of the upcoming season 3 of the fantasy web series.</p>
   <p>As fans eagerly wait for the new season, Cavill's statement has raised the excitement level even higher. But what exactly did he mean by 'real fear'?</p>
   <p>One can assume that he is talking about the intense action scenes and high stakes of the new season. If you have followed 'The Witcher' so far, you know it's not for the faint-hearted.</p>
   <p>Cavill's character, Geralt of Rivia, has faced all kinds of supernatural beings, monsters, and magic. In the last season, we saw him in a brutal showdown with his arch-nemesis, the sorceress Fringilla Vigo. And with the season 2 cliffhanger ending, we can expect things to get even more intense in the upcoming season.</p>
   <p>But let's not forget that 'The Witcher' is much more than just action and gore. It's also a story of complex characters, intricate politics, and deep mythology.</p>
   <p>Cavill's statement can also be interpreted as a reference to the mental and emotional challenges that Geralt will face in season 3. The character has always struggled with his identity, his purpose in life, and his relationships with other humans and non-humans.</p>
   <p>Season 3 will likely delve deeper into Geralt's psyche and explore his fears and doubts. As Cavill himself said in an interview, "Geralt is going to be pushed in directions where he's going to have to face some of his own demons."</p>
