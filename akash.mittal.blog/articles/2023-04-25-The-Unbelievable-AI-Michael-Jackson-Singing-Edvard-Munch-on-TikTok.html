    <p>When we think of technology and art, we often imagine complicated machinery that creates complex images or sounds. But technology has come a long way since the first printing press or the first recorded music.</p>
    <p>Recently, a video surfaced on TikTok that shocked the world. It featured an AI-generated Michael Jackson singing Edvard Munch's famous painting, "The Scream". The video went viral in a matter of hours, and people started appreciating the incredible beauty and creativity of the collaboration.</p>
    <blockquote>
     "It's mind-boggling how advanced technology has become. This video is a testament to the limitless possibilities of AI and its potential to inspire both art and music," said a tech expert in an interview.
    </blockquote>
    <p>The AI used deep learning algorithms to analyze Michael Jackson's voice and singing style, and then recreated it in Munch's signature abstract style. The result is a stunning visual and musical experience that has taken the internet by storm.</p>
    <p>But this is not the first time technology has merged art and music. Let's take a look at some other examples:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>The Grammy-winning album, "Random Access Memories" by Daft Punk, was created using a custom-built RAM-music sequencer that blended live instruments and electronic music.</li>
     <li>British artist, David Hockney, used an iPad and some painting apps to create a series of digital paintings.</li>
     <li>Musician and composer, Philip Glass, used the principles of fractal geometry to create his music.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As we can see, technology has made it possible to create new and innovative works of art and music that were not possible before. The AI Michael Jackson video is just one example of how technology can inspire us to look at art and music in a whole new way.</p>
