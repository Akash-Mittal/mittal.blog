   <p>Imagine yourself as a startup founder with a big idea for the blockchain industry. You've got a solid concept, a team of talented developers, and the motivation to disrupt the market. But here's the problem - you're cash strapped and in desperate need of funding and mentorship. This was the case for many startups until Google Cloud stepped in with its Web3 startup program.</p>
   <p>Launched in 2020, the Web3 startup program by Google Cloud aims to provide funding, technical resources, and mentorship to blockchain startups, helping them build scalable and innovative solutions leveraging Google's cloud infrastructure. Recently, Google Cloud chose 11 new blockchain startups from around the world to add to its program, expanding its support and strengthening its commitment to the Web3 space.</p>
   <h2>Concrete Examples of Google Cloud's Web3 Partnerships</h2>
   <p>Google's Web3 startup program has already provided support to several promising blockchain projects. For instance, Ava Labs, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, has achieved remarkable success after being accepted into the program. With Google Cloud's support and mentorship, Ava Labs was able to scale up its network to process more transactions and reduce response times, leading to increased user adoption and market growth.</p>
   <p>Another notable example is Gitcoin, an Ethereum-based platform that connects software developers with open-source projects. After joining Google Cloud's program, Gitcoin was able to leverage Google's cloud resources to build new features, such as a grant matching program, which incentivizes developers to contribute to open-source projects.</p>
