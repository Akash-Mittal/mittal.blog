   <p>Imagine a computer that doesn't rely on electricity but instead on light to power its inner workings. Sounds like science fiction, right? Well, that may soon be a reality thanks to the development of light-powered AI chips.</p>
   <p>It all started with a team of researchers from MIT who were exploring the use of photonic devices for computing. They came up with a design for an artificial neural network that could be powered by light, as opposed to electricity, making it more energy-efficient and faster than traditional chips.</p>
   <p>Their breakthrough led to the creation of a market for light-powered AI chips, with companies like Lightelligence and Lightmatter emerging to capitalize on this innovative technology.</p>
   <h2>Example</h2>
   <p>One area where light-powered AI chips could revolutionize the industry is in autonomous vehicles. With the ability to process vast amounts of data in real-time, these chips could enable self-driving cars to make split-second decisions that could prevent accidents.</p>
   <p>Another example is in healthcare, where these chips could help to improve the accuracy and efficiency of medical diagnoses. By taking advantage of the speed and power of light, doctors could analyze medical images and data faster and more accurately than ever before.</p>
   <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Light-powered AI chips have the potential to transform industries and improve efficiency by relying on light instead of electricity.</li>
    <li>Examples of use cases include autonomous vehicles and healthcare, where the technology could make a significant impact.</li>
    <li>The development of light-powered AI chips is still in its early stages, but the potential for growth and innovation is enormous.</li>
