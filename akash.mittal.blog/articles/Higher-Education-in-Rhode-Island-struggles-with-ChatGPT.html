     <h2>Real Life Examples</h2>
     <p>Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), for instance, has implemented ChatGPT as part of its student services package.

Similarly, Brown University has been experimenting with ChatGPT to improve its advising services for students.</p>
     <p>On the other hand, Bryant University has expressed reservations about ChatGPT.
