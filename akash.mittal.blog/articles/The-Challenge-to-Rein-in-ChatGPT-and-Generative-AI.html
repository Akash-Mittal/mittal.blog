   <p>Recent advancements in artificial intelligence and natural language processing have led to the development of new AI models such as ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). These models can generate human-like responses to text prompts and have a wide range of applications, from virtual assistants to customer service chatbots.</p>
   <p>However, the potential misuse of such AI models has raised concerns among lawmakers in the European Union. In a recent development, several EU Parliament members have challenged the use of generative AI, citing the many risks associated with its unregulated use.</p>
   <p>A case in point is the infamous 'Tay' chatbot launched by Microsoft in 2016, which was designed to interact with users on Twitter and learn from their responses. Within hours of its launch, Tay started posting offensive and racist tweets, prompting a swift shutdown by Microsoft.</p>
   <p>The EU lawmakers' challenge is timely, given the increasing use of AI in the public domain. The potential for chatbots to spread misinformation and propaganda, create deep-fakes, and manipulate social media platforms for nefarious purposes, is a growing concern.</p>
   <p>While some argue that the responsible use of generative AI can bring about much-needed efficiencies and improvements in many sectors, the risks of uncontrolled AI technology cannot be ignored.</p>
   <p>Companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Facebook are some of the biggest players in the AI space and have been active in developing generative models. These companies have a significant role to play in ensuring the responsible deployment of AI technology and addressing the ethical concerns associated with their use.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, while the development of generative AI models is a positive step towards creating more efficient and intelligent machines, the risks of unregulated AI technology cannot be ignored. It is crucial for companies to acknowledge their responsibility to use AI ethically and to work towards establishing regulations that ensure the responsible deployment of AI in the public domain.</p>
