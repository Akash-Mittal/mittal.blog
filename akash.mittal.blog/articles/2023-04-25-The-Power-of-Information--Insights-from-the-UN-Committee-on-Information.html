  <p>Imagine a world where vital information is kept secret from society. A world where peace, freedom and justice are elusive and often nonexistent. Fortunately, we do not have to imagine this reality because, historically, it has been all too common.</p>
  <p>From ancient times to the present day, societies have relied on various forms of communication to understand, share and act on information. However, the steady pace at which communication and media technology has evolved has made it more difficult than ever to stay current and prepared for the next societal shift.</p>
  <p>This issue was at the forefront of discussion during the third meeting of the Committee on Information at the 45th UN Session. The committee explored the role of information and communication in shaping society's collective consciousness, as well as promoting transparency, access, and human rights.</p>
  <p>The meeting featured a range of concrete examples that highlight the power of information in today's world. First, it was noted that access to information is not only a human right but also a prerequisite for sustainable development, as information can help spur innovation and progress in ways never seen before.</p>
  <p>Additionally, the committee addressed the potential of information technology to narrow the digital divide and provide marginalized communities with the tools they need to succeed. The internet and mobile networks have revolutionized education, health, business, and many other sectors, allowing for greater outreach and the potential for collective impact.</p>
  <p>However, the meeting also brought to light some of the challenges that come with a world inundated with information. As we attempt to make sense of the vast amounts of data and conflicting opinions that surround us, communication barriers continue to limit our ability to collaborate and problem-solve effectively.</p>
  <p>The conclusion from the meeting can be summed up in three key points:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Access to information is a fundamental human right and a key driver of progress.</li>
   <li>Information and communication technologies have the power to spread knowledge and promote collective action, but also present challenges in terms of information overload and communication barriers.</li>
   <li>The UN and its member states should work together to ensure equitable access to information and make information technology more accessible to marginalized communities.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The third meeting of the Committee on Information at the 45th UN Session cemented the importance of information in shaping society's trajectory. As we continue to navigate the challenges of our digital age, it will be increasingly important to recognize the power of information and leverage its potential for the greater good.</p>
