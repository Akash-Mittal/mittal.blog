   <h2>An industry-changing partnership</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>Once upon a time in Mumbai, a young filmmaker named Raman needed to find a way to distribute his film beyond the traditional means. He turned to Shemaroo, a leading Indian content provider, for their expertise. The company suggested using blockchain technology to ensure that the film would remain secure and accessible to the right people. Raman was intrigued by the idea and asked Shemaroo to help him make it a reality.</p>
   <p>That conversation sparked a fruitful partnership between Shemaroo and Near Foundation, a leading Web3.0 infrastructure provider. By joining forces, the two companies aim to revolutionize the media industry by integrating blockchain with traditional content distribution methods.</p>
