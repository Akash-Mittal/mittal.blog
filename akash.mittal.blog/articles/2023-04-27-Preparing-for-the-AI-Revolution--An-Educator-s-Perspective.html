    <h2>The Story of Jim:</h2>
    <p>Jim was an experienced software developer who had been working with his team for over a decade. One day, his boss informed him that their company was planning to automate their entire codebase using an AI-powered tool. Initially, Jim was skeptical but he soon realized that the tool could help him and his team deliver code faster with fewer errors. However, he faced a significant challenge - his lack of knowledge on AI and machine learning.</p>
    <p>Jim's story is not unique. With the rapid advancements in AI, educators around the world are grappling with the same problem. How do we prepare our students for a world where AI and automation are becoming the norm?</p>

    <p>Another way is to help students understand the ethical implications of AI. For example, by discussing the potential biases that exist in AI models or ethical considerations around the use of autonomous weapons.</p>
