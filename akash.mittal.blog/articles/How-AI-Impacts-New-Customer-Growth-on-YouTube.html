    <p>Imagine a world where YouTube is just a blank website with no videos, no recommendations and no comments. That was YouTube in its early years when AI technology was not yet available. Fast forward to today, the platform has grown to be the second largest search engine with over 2 billion monthly active users.</p>

    <h2>Real-life Examples</h2>
    <p>One of the biggest impacts of AI on new customer growth on YouTube is personalized recommendations. AI algorithms analyze user data such as watch history, search queries, and engagement metrics to suggest videos based on the user's interests. This feature has helped YouTube retain users by keeping them engaged on the platform for longer periods of time.</p>
    <p>Another example is Google's AI-powered "Bumper Machine" which creates 6-second advertisements for YouTube videos. With this tool, companies can create short, attention-grabbing ads that are more likely to be watched by viewers, increasing the chances of new customer growth.</p>
    <p>One of the main companies that have utilized AI on YouTube is Nike with their "Dream Crazy" campaign. By leveraging AI to analyze viewer data, the brand was able to target certain demographics and create personalized ads that resonated with their audience. This resulted in a 10% increase in sales and a 103% increase in website traffic.</p>
    <p>Another company that has benefited from AI on YouTube is Coca-Cola. By using personalized video ads, the brand was able to increase click-through rates by 336%. They also used AI to analyze viewer comments on YouTube to get insights into their audience's likes and dislikes.</p>
