   <h2>An Exciting Story</h2>
   <p>In the early 2000s, a chess champion named Garry Kasparov went head to head with an artificial intelligence program called Deep Blue. Kasparov, who had never lost to a computer opponent before, was beaten in a stunning upset that sent shockwaves through the chess world.</p>
   <p>Many people believed that this victory for AI was a fluke, and that humans would always dominate in creative activities like chess. But over the years, we have seen AI systems get better and better at tasks once thought to be the exclusive domain of humans, from playing complex games like Go to writing poetry and composing music.</p>
   <p>So what does the future hold for AI? Let's take a closer look.</p>
   <h2>Example</h2>
   <p>AI is already transforming many industries, and its potential uses are nearly limitless. Here are just a few examples:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>In healthcare, AI could revolutionize the way we diagnose and treat diseases. AI-powered imaging tools can help doctors detect cancer early on, while machine learning algorithms can analyze massive amounts of medical data to identify new treatments and improve patient outcomes.</li>
    <li>In finance, AI can help banks and investment firms identify patterns in the stock market and make faster, more informed investment decisions. It can also be used to detect fraud and mitigate risk.</li>
    <li>In manufacturing, AI can optimize production lines and reduce waste by analyzing data and identifying areas for improvement. It can also help companies automate repetitive tasks, freeing up workers to focus on more creative and complex work.</li>
   </ul>
