   <h2>The Story</h2>
   <p>Imagine you're chatting with a friend on ChatGPT when suddenly you receive a message from another user claiming to be a representative from ChatGPT Support. They tell you that your account is about to be suspended because of suspicious activity, and that you need to provide your password to verify your identity.</p>
   <p>What would you do?</p>
   <p>If you're like most people, you might feel anxious and worried. You don't want to lose access to your account, and you don't want to be accused of wrongdoing. So you might be tempted to share your password, even if it feels risky.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, this is exactly what scammers are counting on. They use social engineering tactics to trick users into sharing sensitive information, and they often succeed.</p>
