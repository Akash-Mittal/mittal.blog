    <h2>A Tale of Two Movies</h2>
    <p>It was a hot summer day, and I decided to go to the theatre to watch two movies. The first one was a sci-fi thriller, and the second one was a romantic drama. As soon as I entered the theatre for the first movie, I noticed that the screen size was smaller than usual. I ignored it and started watching the movie. After a few minutes, I realized that the sound quality was also not up to the mark. The dialogue was unclear, and the background score was too loud. I struggled to understand what the characters were saying.</p>
    <p>After the first movie ended, I went to the next theatre to watch the second movie. As soon as I entered, I was amazed at the huge screen size and the crystal-clear sound quality. The background score was perfectly balanced with the dialogue, and it enhanced my overall movie-watching experience. I enjoyed the movie thoroughly.</p>

    <h2>Real-life Examples of AI in the Film Industry</h2>
    <p>The second movie that I watched was made using AI technology, which explained the difference in the movie-watching experience. AI technology is transforming the film industry and enhancing the overall movie-watching experience. Here are some real-life examples:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>The trailer for the horror movie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHhZdlwW8_0">'Morgan'</a> was created entirely by IBM's Watson AI. The AI system analyzed the entire movie to determine the most gripping moments and composed a trailer to reflect those moments.</li>
     <li>The movie <a href="https://www.paramount.com/movies/terminator-dark-fate">'Terminator: Dark Fate'</a> used AI technology to de-age Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton. This technology was used to recreate their younger selves from old footage.</li>
     <li>The movie <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80177408">'The Irishman'</a> used AI technology to de-age the actors. This technology was used to make Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci appear younger in the early scenes of the movie.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>AI technology has proved to be a game-changer for the film industry. It has enabled filmmakers to create stunning visual effects, de-age actors, and even compose movie trailers. The use of AI technology has also led to a significant improvement in the overall movie-watching experience, with crystal-clear sound quality and high-definition visuals. While AI technology has its advantages, it is important to note that it also raises ethical concerns about who owns the rights to the generated content and how it affects the job market for movie professionals. Nevertheless, it is clear that AI technology is here to stay, and it will continue to revolutionize the film industry.</p>
    <h3>Three critical comments are:</h3>
    <ol>
     <li>The use of AI technology raises ethical concerns about who owns the rights to the generated content.</li>
     <li>The rise of AI technology may lead to job redundancies for certain movie professionals as machines are increasingly being used to perform their tasks.</li>
     <li>The use of AI technology in the film industry necessitates careful consideration of the legal implications involved.</li>
    </ol>
