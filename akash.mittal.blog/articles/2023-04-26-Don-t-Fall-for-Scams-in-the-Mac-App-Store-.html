  <p>It was a beautiful day and Harry, a graphic designer, needed a new app to complete his latest project. He decided to search the Mac App Store for a reliable graphic design tool.</p>
  <p>After scrolling through the app store, Harry found an app that caught his attention. The app was called ChatGPT, and it promised advanced graphic designing tools for a reasonable price.</p>
  <p>Excitedly, Harry clicked the "Install" button and waited for the app to download. But what he didn't know was that the app he had just installed was a fake ChatGPT app that would harm his computer and steal his personal information.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, Harry's story is not unique. Many people fall for scams in the Mac App Store every day. Here are some concrete examples of scams to watch out for:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><span class="bold">Fake apps:</span> These apps pretend to be legitimate, but they contain malware or ransomware that can harm your computer or steal your personal information. Look for apps that have high ratings, lots of reviews, and legitimate developer information.</li>
   <li><span class="bold">Phishing scams:</span> These scams involve emails that look like they come from Apple or another legitimate company.
