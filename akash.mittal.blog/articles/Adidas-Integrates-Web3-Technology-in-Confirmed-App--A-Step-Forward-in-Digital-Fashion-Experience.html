  <h1>Adidas Goes Web3: A Digital Fashion Experience Like Never Before</h1> <img src="../images/Adidas-Integrates-Web3-Technology-in-Confirmed-App--A-Step-Forward-in-Digital-Fashion-Experience.jpeg" alt="+Adidas Integrates Web3 Technology in Confirmed App: A Step Forward in Digital Fashion Experience+">
  <p>Itâ??s not new that Adidas has been taking huge strides in digital technology. The brand has been incorporating innovative technologies in its products to enhance the customer experience for years. But this time, they have gone a step further. Adidas has announced that it will integrate Web3 technology into its Confirmed App, a platform that the brand uses for its high-profile shoe releases.</p>
  <p>The Confirmed App is a hub where Adidas releases its hyped footwear collaborations with celebrities, fashion labels, and influencers. The app allows users to reserve their favorite pair of sneakers online and pick them in-store. The addition of Web3 technology to the Confirmed App will enable Adidas to offer a more immersive and interactive shopping experience to its customers.</p>
  <p>Imagine booking a pair of Yeezy sneakers on the Confirmed App and getting an augmented reality image of the shoes, showcasing how it would look on you even before you buy it, or a virtual 3D showroom filled with latest Adidas sneaker releases. All this and much more is in the works with Adidas and their integration of Web3 technology in the Confirmed App.</p>
  <h2>Real Life Examples of Web3 Integration in Fashion Industry</h2>
  <p>Adidas is not the first company to embrace Web3 technology in the fashion industry. The digital fashion space is seeing increased adoption of blockchain-based tools that are transforming the way people shop, view, and understand fashion.</p>

  <p>Another example of a brand that is using blockchain technology to enhance its offering is Nike. The sportswear giant has been working on a patent-pending blockchain-based platform called â??CryptoKicksâ??, which allows users to authenticate shoes and trade with other users over the blockchain.</p>
