   <p>Imagine you're trying to find a good restaurant in a new city. You might start by googling "best restaurants in [city name]". The results you get will likely be a mix of articles, review sites, and directories. You'll have to read through them all, compare prices and ratings, and eventually make a decision based on incomplete information. It's a frustrating experience, but it's what we've come to expect from the internet.</p>
   <p>But what if you could do a search like that and get a single, definitive answer? What if the search engine knew not just which restaurants were the highest-rated, but also which ones had tables available, which ones matched your dietary restrictions, and which ones were most popular among your social network?</p>
   <p>This is the promise of Web 3.0: a smarter, more intuitive internet that understands the needs of its users and delivers personalized results in real time.</p>
   <h2>Real-life Examples of Web 3.0</h2>
   <p>Some of the main companies leading the charge into Web 3.0 include:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a> - a blockchain platform that allows developers to build decentralized applications ("dapps")</li>
    <li><a href="https://solana.com/">Solana</a> - a high-performance blockchain that can process 60,000 transactions per second</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.algorand.com/">Algorand</a> - a blockchain that offers fast and secure transactions with low fees</li>
   </ul>
   <p>One real-life example of Web 3.0 in action is the concept of a "smart city". In a smart city, all aspects of urban life are connected and optimized for efficiency. For example, traffic lights can communicate with each other to reduce congestion, parking spots can be reserved in advance, and energy usage can be automatically adjusted based on demand. Singapore is one of the most advanced examples of a smart city, with a unified digital platform that connects everything from transportation to healthcare.</p><summary>Key Takeaways:</summary>
