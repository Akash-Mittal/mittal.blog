    <p class="intro-text">Imagine being a government worker stuck in a meeting, needing to know the real-time in a different part of the country or world for a critical deadline. The tiny clock, powered by ChatGPT, is the solution for quick, accurate timekeeping.</p>
    <p>The tiny clock is different from traditional clocks one might find in a workspace or on a smartphone. Its compact size belies its power, as the tiny clock is always connected to a real-time clock via the internet, with the help of ChatGPTâ??s chatbot technology.</p>
    <h2>Real-life Examples</h2>
    <p>There are already companies who utilize real-time clocks for business purposes, such as Rulai, which uses AI-powered chatbots to help companies automate their daily operations. Rulaiâ??s chatbot technology is equipped with real-time clock functions and can answer questions based on current time in any time zone. This is the perfect solution for businesses with multiple branches that function in different time zones.</p>
    <p>Another company that utilizes real-time clocks is Uber, which bases its fare rate on both current location and time of day. This ensures that customers will not be overcharged for rides during high traffic hours or 'surge' hours. Uberâ??s technology utilizes real-time clocks for pricing to ensure that users are only charged appropriately and fairly.</p>
    <h2>Main Companies</h2>
    <p>The tiny clock is primarily powered by ChatGPT, technology created by GPT Group, a chatbot platform that utilizes AI and machine learning to create chatbots capable of natural language processing. The company has also recently discussed plans to utilize AI and real-time clocks to create a chatbot that could potentially schedule medical appointments and remind patients of upcoming appointments.</p>
