  <p>As I was browsing through the internet, I stumbled upon some exciting news that the famous Indiana Jones is making a comeback in the world of video games. With the release of the game's trailer, my excitement grew further. But as a web developer, I couldn't help but wonder how this game was made and what technologies were used. So, I decided to research and uncover the secrets behind the new Indiana Jones game through HTML5.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Real-life Examples</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The new Indiana Jones game is developed by Bethesda Game Studios, the makers of the popular Elder Scrolls franchise. According to the developers, the game is built upon a new game engine called 'Creation Engine 2'. The game engine is designed to take the advantage of the latest next-gen hardware, including the new PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One real-life example that demonstrates the power of HTML5 in game development is 'Angry Birds'. The game became an instant hit, and the HTML5 version of the game was even more successful. It provided cross-platform compatibility, which means that the game can be played on any modern web browser on both desktop and mobile devices.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another noteworthy example is the game 'Cut the Rope'. The game is built entirely using HTML5, and it provides an immersive gaming experience. It's a testament to the power of HTML5 to create engaging games using modern web technologies.</p>
