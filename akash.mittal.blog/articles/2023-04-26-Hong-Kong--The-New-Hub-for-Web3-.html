    <p>It was a busy Monday morning when John, a blockchain developer and entrepreneur, received a notification on his phone. It was an email from the Hong Kong government, inviting him to set up his new Web3 startup in the city. John was surprised, as he had been facing regulatory issues in his home country, which had been cracking down on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies.</p>
    <p>John is not alone. A growing number of Web3 firms and talents are turning their attention to Hong Kong, as the city's regulatory environment becomes increasingly favorable to the nascent industry. While other countries such as China, India, and the United States have been imposing stricter regulations on cryptocurrency and blockchain companies, Hong Kong has taken a more open approach.</p>
    <p>One concrete example of Hong Kong's welcoming stance towards Web3 is the recent approval of the city's first cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the local regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). The ETF is set to track the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum and it is expected to be launched in the coming months.</p>
    <p>Another example is the establishment of the Global Digital Finance Center (GDFC), a non-profit organization that aims to promote the development of the digital finance industry in Hong Kong and beyond. The GDFC has already attracted a number of leading Web3 companies, including Binance, Circle, and ConsenSys.</p>
    <p>So why is Hong Kong becoming the new hub for Web3?</p>

    <ol>
     <li>Hong Kong has a favorable regulatory environment for Web3 companies</li>
     <li>The city is home to a growing number of Web3 startups and talents</li>
