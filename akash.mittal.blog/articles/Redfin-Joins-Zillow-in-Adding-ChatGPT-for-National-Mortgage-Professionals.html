    <p>Buying a home can be a stressful process, and with the pandemic causing long delays and increased demand, customers expect fast and reliable service from mortgage professionals. This is where Redfin and Zillow come in - two of the biggest names in real estate.</p>
    <p>In 2020, Zillow introduced a customer service solution known as ChatGPT, powered by artificial intelligence. ChatGPT allows for quick and accurate responses to customer inquiries, improving the user experience. Redfin has taken note and announced plans to add ChatGPT to its mortgage division as well.</p>
    <p>"We want to provide the best service possible to our customers, and ChatGPT will allow us to do just that," said Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman in a recent press release. "We are excited to partner with Zillow in this initiative and look forward to the benefits it will bring."</p>

    <h2>Real Life Examples</h2>
    <p>One major advantage of ChatGPT is its ability to answer customer questions instantly. For example, customers can ask about interest rates, pre-approval requirements, or estimated closing costs and receive a response within seconds. This not only saves valuable time for both the customer and the mortgage professional but also creates a more positive experience for the customer.</p>
    <p>Redfin and Zillow have recognized the need for quick and efficient responses, and they plan to incorporate ChatGPT into their existing technology to better serve their customers. By offering this service, customers will have peace of mind knowing they can get the answers they need without any wait time.</p>
