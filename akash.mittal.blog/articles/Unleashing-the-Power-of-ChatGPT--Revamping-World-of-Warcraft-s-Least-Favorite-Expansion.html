   <p class="lead">When World of Warcraft (WoW) was first launched back in 2004, no one could have predicted the massive success it would become. Cut to over a decade later, and the game still boasts a loyal following. However, even a franchise as popular as WoW has its fair share of missteps. One such misstep was the Battle for Azeroth expansion that launched in 2018.</p>
   <p>As avid WoW players will tell you, the Battle for Azeroth expansion was received with mixed reviews. A number of players felt that the expansion failed to live up to the hype and instead put the franchise on a downward trajectory. In fact, the expansion ranks among the least loved additions to the game's universe.</p>
   <p>Fast forward to 2021, and we have a surprising turn of events. John Hight, the executive producer and vice president of WoW at Blizzard Entertainment, revealed that he was inspired by ChatGPT (a language model developed by OpenAI) to revisit the unpopular expansion. ChatGPT suggested that the company take a closer look at the expansion and possibly revamp some of its features. Hight believes that ChatGPT's insights could help reinvent the expansion and bring new life to the game.</p>
   <p>If Hight's plan comes to fruition, it could be a game-changer for Blizzard. Given that WoW still boasts over 2 million active users, a revamped expansion could breathe new life into the game and possibly even draw back users who have left the game over time. But just how effective are ChatGPT's recommendations in real-world applications?</p>
   <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Real-Life Examples of ChatGPT's Impact</h2>
   <p>It's worth noting that ChatGPT isn't the first language model used to inform business decisions. In fact, it builds on the success of previous models like OpenAIâ??s GPT-2 and GPT-3, which have been used to develop everything from chatbots and marketing strategies to even creative writing.</p>
   <p>One real-world example that demonstrates the power of ChatGPT is how Microsoft used the technology to revamp its virtual assistant, Cortana. Similar to WoW, Cortana was struggling to keep up with other virtual assistants in the market. However, after using ChatGPT to develop more nuanced and natural language responses, Microsoft was able to give Cortana a much-needed refresh that put it back in the game.</p>
   <p>Another example of ChatGPT's immense potential is how it has been used to revolutionize the healthcare industry. Researchers at Oxford University used the model to develop an AI program that accurately identified heart disease patients who were at risk of developing complications post-surgery. The model was over 80 percent accurate, showcasing the ways that ChatGPT can be used to make healthcare more efficient and effective.</p>
   <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Conclusion and Critical Comments</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>While ChatGPT is still in its early stages, it has a lot of potential to change the way that companies make business decisions. It's likely that we'll see more and more businesses using language models like ChatGPT to inform their strategies and decisions over the coming years.</li>
    <li>However, there are concerns that using language models can lead to ethical dilemmas. For example, if a business uses ChatGPT to make a decision that harms consumers, who is responsible for the outcome? ChatGPT is still a machine learning model and has limitations that we need to be wary of.</li>
    <li>Ultimately, ChatGPTâ??s potential is immense, but we need to use it responsibly. If Hight's plan for World of Warcraft goes ahead, it could be a turning point for the franchise and an encouraging sign that language models like ChatGPT have an exciting future ahead.</li>
