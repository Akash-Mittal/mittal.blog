     <h2>Introduction</h2>
     <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of our lives, from virtual assistants to self-driving cars. AI has revolutionized the way we live and is expected to dominate the future. This article explores how AI is changing the way we live and its impact on our daily lives.</p>

    <section id="real-life-example">
     <h2>Real Life Examples</h2>
     <p>One of the significant impacts AI has had on our lives is the adoption of virtual assistants. Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, and Google Assistant are examples of virtual assistants that have made our lives more comfortable. These virtual assistants can perform tasks like setting alarms, playing music, and even ordering food.</p>
     <p>Another real-life example is the use of AI in self-driving cars. Tesla, Waymo, and Uber are some of the companies using AI to build autonomous cars. These cars can navigate through roads, recognize traffic signs, and avoid obstacles.</p>
     <p>Medical diagnosis is another area where AI has made significant contributions. Companies like IBM are developing AI systems that can diagnose diseases with higher accuracy and speed. AI in medical diagnosis could help doctors diagnose and treat diseases at an early stage, thus saving lives.</p>
