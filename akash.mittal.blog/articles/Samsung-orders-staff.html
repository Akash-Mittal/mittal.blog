    <p>As the coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, it's not just schools and public events that are being cancelled. Large corporations, such as Samsung, are now following suit. According to recent reports, Samsung has ordered its staff to leave the office and work from home in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>This move by Samsung comes at a time when many companies are increasing their efforts to keep their employees safe from the virus. While some companies are cancelling business trips and events, others are implementing remote working policies, like Samsung, to keep their employees out of the office.</p>
    <p>Other companies that have implemented similar policies include Microsoft, Amazon, and Twitter. Microsoft has asked its Seattle and San Francisco employees to work from home until March 25, while Amazon has asked its Seattle and Bellevue employees to not come into work until the end of March. Twitter has gone one step further and made it mandatory for all of its employees around the world to work from home.</p>
    <p>All of these companies have realized the potential impact the virus could have on their employees, and are doing what they can to prevent the spread. By working from home, employees can help reduce the spread of the virus, and at the same time, avoid getting infected.</p>
