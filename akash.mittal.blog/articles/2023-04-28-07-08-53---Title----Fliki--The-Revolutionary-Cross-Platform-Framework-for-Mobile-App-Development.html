  <p></p>
  <p>Once upon a time, there was a startup based in Silicon Valley. They had a great idea for a mobile app that would revolutionize the way people connect with each other. However, they faced a common problem that many startups encounter: they didn't have the resources to develop the app for both iOS and Android simultaneously.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Enter Fliki, the cross-platform framework that solved their problem in no time. Thanks to Fliki, they were able to develop their app for both platforms using a single codebase, saving them time and money in the process.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Fliki is a powerful framework that allows developers to create mobile apps that work seamlessly across multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, and web. It is built on top of popular web technologies such as React and Node.js, and provides a simple, yet powerful API that allows developers to create native-looking apps with ease.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>What makes Fliki stand out from other cross-platform frameworks is its ability to generate truly native code for each platform. This means that the apps built with Fliki are not "hybrids" or "webviews," but rather real, native apps that look and feel like they were built specifically for each platform.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Real-life Examples</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One of the most prominent examples of Fliki in action is the popular mobile app, Discord. Discord is a communication platform for gamers that allows them to chat, voice call, and share content with each other. The app was built using Fliki, which allowed the developers to release the app for both iOS and Android simultaneously.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another example is the mobile app for Shopify, the e-commerce platform. The app was built using Fliki, and allows users to manage their online stores from their mobile devices. The app features a native-looking UI, and provides a seamless experience across multiple platforms.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Main Companies</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Discord and Shopify are just two examples of the many companies that have used Fliki to build their mobile apps. Other notable companies include Facebook, Walmart, and Bloomberg.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In summary, Fliki is a powerful cross-platform framework that enables developers to create native-looking mobile apps for multiple platforms using a single codebase. Its ability to generate truly native code for each platform is what sets it apart from other cross-platform frameworks. With more and more companies adopting Fliki, it's clear that this framework is here to stay.</p>
