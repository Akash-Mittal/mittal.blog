   <p class="lead">As a teacher, I've seen firsthand the impact that technology can have on students. Years ago, when I started teaching, the only technology available was a dusty old chalkboard. But today, we have access to powerful tools that allow students to learn in interactive and engaging ways.</p>
   <p>For example, take a look at Quizlet, a platform that allows students to create digital flashcards and quizzes. Rather than memorizing stacks of notecards, students can study anywhere, anytime, using their laptops or smartphones. And they can share their resources with their peers, creating a collaborative learning environment.</p>
   <p>Another company that's driving innovation in education is Edmentum. Their online programs are designed to personalize learning and track student progress. Teachers can monitor each student's performance, identify problem areas, and adjust their teaching accordingly.</p>
   <p>Of course, these are just two examples of the many companies that are changing classrooms in exciting ways. But as with any new technology, there are challenges to overcome. Let's take a closer look at three critical points:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Technology is only a tool.</li>
    <p>As much as we love shiny new gadgets, they're only useful if they help us achieve our goals. Teachers must ensure that technology supports their lesson plans, rather than detracting from them. And students must learn to use technology responsibly, recognizing that it's just one tool in a larger toolbox.</p>
    <li>Technology can widen the achievement gap.</li>
    <p>Not all students have equal access to technology. Schools in low-income areas may not have the funds to purchase the latest devices or software. And even in wealthier areas, some students may not have access to technology at home. As we integrate technology into the classroom, we must be mindful of these disparities, and work to level the playing field.</p>
    <li>Technology can never replace good teaching.</li>
    <p>As powerful as technology may be, it can't replace the human element in education. Teachers are still crucial to the learning process, serving as mentors, role models, and advisors. Even as we embrace new technology, we must remember that effective teaching is about more than just gadgets and gizmos.</p>
