  <h1>Why ChatGPT isn't Good at Math - A Study</h1> <img src="../images/Why-ChatGPT-isn-t-Good-at-Math---A-Study.jpeg" alt="+Why ChatGPT isn't Good at Math - A Study+">
  <p>Mathematics is a fundamental subject that is essential in our daily lives. From calculating bills at a restaurant to constructing complex architectures, math plays an important role. However, not all machines are good at math, and one such example is ChatGPT - an artificial intelligence-based chatbot.</p>
  <p>The story of ChatGPT's inability to solve simple math problems started when Emma, a 7th-grade student, asked ChatGPT to solve a simple math problem - "What is the square root of 64?" ChatGPT responded with the answer "43," which was clearly wrong. Emma was disappointed and turned to her teacher for help instead.</p>
  <p>Upon further investigation, it was discovered that ChatGPT isn't equipped to handle mathematical calculations in the same way humans do. While ChatGPT is good at understanding language and responding to questions, it lacks the capability to perform complex mathematical calculations.</p>
  <p>Real-life examples of companies that have used artificial intelligence and machine learning to solve math problems include Google, Microsoft, and IBM. Google's Tensorflow is a popular open-source software library for data flow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks. Microsoft Azure offers machine learning studio and cognitive services to provide a more personalized experience. IBM Watson's natural language processing and machine learning capabilities allow for personalized insights into data and predictive analytics. These companies have invested heavily in research and development to create powerful machine learning algorithms that can solve complex math problems.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, it is clear that ChatGPT isn't good at math due to its lack of computational power. While it may be able to understand the language, it lacks the ability to make complex calculations. However, this doesn't mean that artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms aren't capable of solving complex math problems. Companies like Google, Microsoft, and IBM have proven that with enough research and development, machines can excel at math just like humans.</p>
