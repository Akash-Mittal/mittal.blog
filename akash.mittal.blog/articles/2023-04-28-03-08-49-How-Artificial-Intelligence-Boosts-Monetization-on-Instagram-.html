    <h2>The Rise of AI-Powered Monetization on Instagram</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time on Instagram, there was a problem: brands and advertisers were struggling to monetize their content on the platform. Despite having millions of users, Instagram's ad revenue was not as high as its potential. That was until the arrival of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) on the platform.</p>
    <p>With AI and ML, Instagram was able to offer personalized and targeted ad experiences to its users. By analyzing user behavior and preferences, AI algorithms were able to recommend the right products and services to the right people at the right time, leading to higher engagement, conversion rates, and ultimately revenue.</p>
