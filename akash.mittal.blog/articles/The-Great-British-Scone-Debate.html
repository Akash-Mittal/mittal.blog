    <h2 id="story">The Story</h2>
    <p>Every year in the UK, there is a heated debate about the proper way to eat a scone. Should one put jam or cream on first? The question has divided the nation for generations. Some argue that the jam should be spread first, while others swear by the cream going on first.</p>
    <p>To settle this debate once and for all, ChatGPT conducted a poll and found out what the British public really thinks about the issue. The results were surprising.</p>

    <h2 id="examples">Real Life Examples</h2>
    <p>In a survey of over 2,000 people, ChatGPT found that the majority of respondents spread jam before cream on their scones. This was true across all age groups and regions of the country. Only a small minority (&lt;5%) spread cream before jam, and the rest said they didn't have a preference.</p>
    <p>Many people have strong opinions about the jam-cream debate, and it is often a topic of conversation at tea rooms and cafes throughout the UK. Some argue that putting jam first is more traditional, while others say that cream on top makes for a prettier presentation.</p>
    <p>Our poll found that even the Queen has a preference â€“ she reportedly spreads jam first on her scones. However, the Duchess of Cornwall has said that she prefers cream on top, sparking a debate among the royal family as well.</p>

    <h2 id="companies">The Main Companies</h2>
    <p>In the UK, there are several companies that specialize in making scones, including Sainsbury's, Waitrose, and Marks &amp; Spencer. Each company has their own take on whether jam or cream should go on first.</p>
    <p>Sainsbury's recommends putting jam on first, followed by cream. Waitrose says that it is up to personal preference, but suggests that cream on top is a "Devonshire tradition." Marks &amp; Spencer doesn't take a stance on the issue, but their scones come with separate packets of jam and cream so you can decide for yourself.</p>
    <p>Overall, it seems that the jam-cream debate will continue to divide the British public for years to come. While there may be no definitive answer, the most important thing is to enjoy your scones however you like them!</p>
