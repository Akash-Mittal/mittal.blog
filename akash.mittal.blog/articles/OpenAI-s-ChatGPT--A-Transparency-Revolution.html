   <h2>An interesting story</h2>
   <p>Imagine talking to a chatbot that seems to understand everything you say and responds just like a human. The conversation flows smoothly, and you feel satisfied with the experience. But have you ever wondered what goes behind the scenes? Is the chatbot really transparent about its AI-driven responses? Well, the answer is no most of the time.</p>
   <p>However, OpenAI's ChatGPT is changing the game.</p>
   <h2>Real-life examples</h2>
   <p>ChatGPT is an AI-powered chatbot created by OpenAI, a research organization founded by tech luminaries such as Elon Musk and Sam Altman. It uses a natural language processing algorithm to converse with users on various topics.</p>
   <p>Recently, ChatGPT had to withdraw from the Italian market due to questions of transparency. Italian authorities demanded that OpenAI should ensure that users are aware of conversing with an AI-powered chatbot and not a human. After complying with the regulations and ensuring transparency, ChatGPT was allowed to resume service in Italy.</p>
   <p>ChatGPT's transparency in communication has also been demonstrated in its interactions with users on social media platforms. For example, when a user asked ChatGPT on Twitter, "Are you human?", its response was, "I'm not human, but I'm here to help you nevertheless."</p>
   <h2>Main companies</h2>
   <p>OpenAI is at the forefront of developing AI-driven applications and technologies that benefit humanity. Its mission is to create a safe and beneficial AI system that serves everyone.</p>
   <p>Another leading chatbot provider is Facebook AI. Its chatbots are used by businesses to interact with customers on the Facebook Messenger platform. Facebook AI chatbots are designed to assist with basic customer service and support issues and provide personalized recommendations.</p>
   <p>Google also offers an AI-powered chatbot called Google Assistant. It is integrated into Google's smartphones, smart home devices, and other platforms to provide users with quick and intelligent answers.</p>
