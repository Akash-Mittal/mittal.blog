  <p>It was the third game of the NBA Playoffs 2021 between the Milwaukee Bucks and the Miami Heat. The series was tied at 1-1, and everyone was waiting for a game-changing performance from Giannis Antetokounmpo. But, unfortunately, that didn't happen as Giannis was ruled out for the game due to an ankle injury.</p>
  <p>This was a big blow for the Milwaukee Bucks as Giannis is not only their best player but also the reigning NBA MVP. Without him, the Bucks had to rely on other players to step up and fill the void left by him.</p>
  <h2>Concrete Examples of the Game without Giannis</h2>
  <p>The absence of Giannis was clearly visible in the game. The Bucks struggled to find their offensive rhythm, and their defense also suffered. They lost the game by 15 points, and the series momentum shifted in favor of the Miami Heat.</p>
  <p>Khris Middleton, who is the second-best player on the Bucks team, scored 17 points, but it wasn't enough to lead the team to victory. Jrue Holiday, who was brought in the off-season to provide support to Giannis, also struggled and finished with only 9 points.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, the Miami Heat played an excellent game, and their star player Jimmy Butler stepped up and scored 17 points to lead the Heat to victory. Bam Adebayo also played a crucial role in the win, and the Miami Heat took a 2-1 lead in the series.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, Giannis Antetokounmpo's absence was a big blow to the Milwaukee Bucks, and they struggled to find their rhythm in the game. Without Giannis, other players need to step up and fill the void left by him. If Giannis returns for the next game, the Bucks will have a better chance of winning and leveling the series.</p>
