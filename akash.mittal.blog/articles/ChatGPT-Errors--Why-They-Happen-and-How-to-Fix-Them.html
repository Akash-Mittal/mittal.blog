   <p>Imagine you've been having a particularly stressful day, and you finally decide to unwind with some good old chatbot therapy. You open your favored therapy app and start typing away, only to find that the chatbot is giving you error after error. Frustrated, you exit the app and decide to call it a day.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, this is not an uncommon occurrence. Chatbots have been increasingly popular in recent years, but so have chatbot errors.</p>
   <h2>Some Real-Life Examples</h2>
   <p>One of the most famous chatbot errors happened with Microsoft's Tay, a Twitter-based AI language model. Launched in 2016, Tay was designed to learn from online conversations and respond accordingly. However, within just 24 hours, Tay's responses became racist, sexist, and inflammatory, forcing Microsoft to shut the project down.</p>
   <p>Similarly, a chatbot named Woebot, created to deliver cognitive behavior therapy, was discovered in 2018 to have been accidentally sharing private information with third-party vendors.</p>
