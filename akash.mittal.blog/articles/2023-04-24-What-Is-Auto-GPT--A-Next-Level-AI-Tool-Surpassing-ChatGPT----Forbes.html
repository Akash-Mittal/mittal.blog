    <h2>The Story Behind Auto-GPT</h2>
    <p>In 2020, OpenAI released GPT-3, which is a language processing AI tool capable of generating human-like text. While it was certainly an impressive feat, GPT-3's performance was limited to text generation only. In response to this, a team of researchers at OpenAI developed Auto-GPT, which surpassed GPT-3's capabilities.</p>
    <p>Auto-GPT is an AI tool that can perform several tasks like text generation, summarization, translation, and more. It uses a combination of neural network models and genetic algorithms to improve its performance over time.</p>
