    <h2>The Power of AI in Video Games</h2>
    <p>When Nathan from Florida started playing the popular game Skyrim, he quickly grew bored with the lackluster conversations between Non-Playable Characters (NPCs). As a computer science major, he decided to take matters into his own hands and create a mod that would use AI technology to enhance NPCs' intelligence and memory. He worked on the mod for several months and incorporated ChatGPT, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) AI tool, into his program.</p>
    <p>The results were astounding. NPCs now had a memory and could remember previous conversations with players, as well as bring up relevant topics based on a player's actions and choices. The NPCs would even initiate conversations on their own, providing endless opportunities for players to learn more about the game's lore and world-building.</p>
    <h2>Real-Life Applications</h2>
    <p>While this may seem like a fun mod for a video game, the implications of using AI in this way go beyond mere entertainment. Companies like Google and Amazon are already using similar NLP AI tools to improve their customer service interactions. These tools allow customer service reps to handle more complex inquiries and provide personalized recommendations to customers based on their past interactions and preferences.</p>
    <p>Additionally, AI-powered chatbots are becoming more common in a variety of industries. Banks use them to help customers check their account balances, schedule appointments, and even apply for loans. Retailers use chatbots to answer customer inquiries, provide product recommendations, and even process payments. As the technology improves, we can expect to see even more innovative applications of AI in our daily lives.</p>
    <h2>The Future of AI in Video Games</h2>
    <p>While the Skyrim mod may be one of the first instances of using AI to enhance NPC interactions, it certainly won't be the last. As game developers continue to look for ways to create immersive worlds for players, incorporating AI technology is an obvious choice. We can expect to see more games utilizing NLP tools to improve conversations and interactions between NPCs and players alike.</p>
