   <p>It's a common misconception that the dark-web is a haven for anonymity and privacy. While some users do enjoy these benefits, the majority of them use the dark-web for nefarious purposes. And that's why law enforcement agencies around the globe are cracking down on illicit activities taking place on the dark-web.</p>
   <p>In the latest operation, the French National Police, Europol, and the Dutch National Police managed to seize three dark-web marketplaces that were facilitating illicit crypto transactions. The operation dubbed DisrupTor has led to the arrest of 179 individuals and the seizure of more than $6.5 million worth of cash and cryptocurrencies.</p>
   <h3>Real-life Examples</h3>
   <p>The three marketplaces seized by the authorities were called Wall Street Market, Silkkitie (known as Valhalla), and German-based drug selling site, Cannazon. These marketplaces offered everything from drugs and weapons to stolen personal information.</p>
   <p>Wall Street Market, one of the largest dark-web marketplaces, had more than 1.15 million registered users and 5,400 vendors selling drugs, weapons, and malware. It had a turnover of more than $31 million in Bitcoin and Monero.</p>
   <p>Silkkitie, on the other hand, was a Finnish marketplace that specialized in the sale of drugs and fake IDs. It had more than 30,000 registered users and over 2000 vendors.</p>
   <p>Cannazon was a German-based drug-selling site that had more than 16,000 registered users. It offered a variety of drugs, including marijuana, ecstasy, and cocaine.</p>
   <h3>Companies Involved</h3>
   <p>The operation involved multiple law enforcement agencies from different countries. The French National Police, Europol, and the Dutch National Police were the main players. However, they were supported by several other agencies, including the United States' DEA and FBI, the UK's NCA, and Germany's BKA.</p>
   <p>The seizure of these marketplaces wouldn't have been possible without the support of several tech companies. In this operation, Blockchain analysis firms Elliptic and CipherTrace provided their expertise to the authorities. They helped to investigate the flow of cryptocurrencies, which aided in the identification of those involved in illicit activities.</p>
   <h3>Summary</h3>
   <p>The DisrupTor operation has been a significant blow to the dark-web's illicit activities. It has shown that law enforcement agencies are determined to tackle cybercrime and are willing to work together to achieve that.</p>
   <p>The operation has also highlighted the importance of Blockchain analysis firms in the fight against crypto-related crimes. Their expertise has been invaluable in identifying those involved and disrupting these criminal activities.</p>
   <p>However, while these seizures are significant, they are only a small fraction of the dark-web's illicit activities. More needs to be done to tackle cybercrime, and law enforcement agencies must continue to work together to achieve that.</p>
