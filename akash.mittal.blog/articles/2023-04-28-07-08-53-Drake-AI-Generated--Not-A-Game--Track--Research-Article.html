   <!-- Introduction -->
   <p>Picture this: Drake is in his studio, working on his latest album. But this time, he's not alone. He's accompanied by an AI program which is generating melodies and beats for him to work with. The result? His latest hit "Not A Game".</p><!-- Real Life Examples -->
   <p>Drake is not the only musician using AI to refine his music. In fact, many major music companies including Sony, Google, and IBM are investing in music AI research.</p>
   <p>One such company is Amper Music, which offers a platform that allows users to create custom music with the help of AI. Another example is Jukedeck, which uses AI to generate royalty-free music for businesses.</p><!-- Conclusion -->
