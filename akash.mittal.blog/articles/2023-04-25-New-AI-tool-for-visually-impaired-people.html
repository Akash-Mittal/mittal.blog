  <h1>An Incredible Change: AI Tool That Describes Surroundings to Visually Impaired People</h1> <img src="../images/2023-04-25-New-AI-tool-for-visually-impaired-people.jpeg" alt="+New AI tool for visually impaired people+">
  <p>Meet John, a visually impaired person who uses a white cane to navigate his way. John loves to travel, but because he cannot see, he is unable to appreciate the beauty around him. Going to new places is always a challenge since he has to depend on others to describe his surroundings. But now, things have changed for John and for millions of visually impaired people around the world.</p>
  <p>Thanks to artificial intelligence (AI), Google has developed a new tool that describes the surroundings to visually impaired individuals. The tool involves a phone camera and a set of headphones, and it works by using machine learning algorithms to recognize objects, read signs, and describe surroundings in a natural language.</p>
  <h2>Concrete Examples:</h2>
  <p>Imagine a visually impaired person walking towards an unfamiliar street. They can now point their phone camera to the street, and the AI tool will describe the surroundings to them in real-time that they could not see with their bare eyes earlier:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>"You are standing on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street."</li>
   <li>"There is a crosswalk ahead of you."</li>
   <li>"There is a coffee shop on your right."</li>
   <li>"There is a bus stop across the road."</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion in Three Points:</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>This AI tool is a game-changer for visually impaired people. It enhances their independence and allows them to enjoy new experiences like never before.</li>
   <li>The benefits of AI technology are immense, and this tool is yet another example of how it can drastically improve the quality of life for people with disabilities.</li>
   <li>We look forward to seeing more innovative AI-based tools that help individuals with disabilities achieve greater independence and enjoy life.</li>
  </ol>
