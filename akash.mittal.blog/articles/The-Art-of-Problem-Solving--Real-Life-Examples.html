    <h2>The Problem with the Lost Wallet</h2>
    <p>Have you ever lost your wallet? If so, you know the feeling of panic and frustration that comes with it. That's exactly what happened to John, a college student, one day on his way to class. He realized he had left his wallet at home and decided to run back to get it. When he returned to his dorm room, he realized his wallet was missing. He searched everywhere, but it was nowhere to be found.</p>
    <p>John knew he had to take action quickly. His wallet contained his ID, credit cards, and cash. He couldn't afford to lose any of it. He started to feel overwhelmed, until he remembered something his grandfather had told him: "Always approach a problem by breaking it down into smaller parts."</p>
