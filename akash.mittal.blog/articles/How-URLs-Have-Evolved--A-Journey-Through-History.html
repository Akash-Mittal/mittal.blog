    <h2>A Brief History of URLs</h2>
    <p>The first ever URL was created in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web. It was a basic hypertext page with links to other pages.</p>
    <p>As the web grew, URLs became more complex and structured. They consist of various parts such as the protocol, domain name, path, and fragment.</p>
    <p>Today, URLs play a crucial role in how we navigate the web. They allow us to easily access and share information across the globe.</p>

    <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
    <p>Let's take a look at some real-life examples of URLs:</p>
    <ul>
     <li><a href="https://www.google.com">www.google.com</a> - The most commonly used search engine.</li>
     <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com">www.facebook.com</a> - The world's largest social media platform.</li>
     <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com">www.amazon.com</a> - The largest online retailer in the world.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Future of URLs</h2>
    <p>As the web evolves, so do URLs. In the near future, we might see more secure URLs with the implementation of HTTPS, which encrypts data between the user and the server.</p>
    <p>There might also be a shift towards more visually-oriented URLs, with websites using images or icons instead of plain text.</p>
    <p>However, some argue that URLs might become obsolete in the future, with the rise of technologies such as voice search and AI assistants.</p>
