    <h2>The Story of Siri</h2>
    <p>In 2011, Apple introduced Siri, the virtual assistant that responds to voice commands and performs tasks like sending text messages and setting reminders. Siri was one of the first mainstream AI technologies to be integrated into a mobile device. Today, Siri is considered a household name, with over half a billion monthly active users. Apple continues to invest heavily in AI technology, and their recent acquisition of Xnor.ai, a startup focused on low-power AI algorithms, is just one example of their commitment to AI innovation.</p>
