  <h2>An Interesting Story: The Rise of Chatbots and Text-Based Apps</h2>
  <p>It's a simple truth: we are living in the digital age. Communication is all around us, and it's changing every day. In this constantly-evolving landscape, chatbots and text-based apps are fast becoming the go-to tools for businesses and consumers alike. They offer convenience, accessibility, and ease of use, all in one neat package.</p>
  <p>But where did this trend start? Who first recognized the power of text-based communication? To answer that question, we need to go back to the early 1990s, and the birth of the internet. As the web grew in popularity, so did the need for fast, efficient ways to communicate online. And that's where chatbots came in.</p>
  <p>Initially, these bots were simple, basic tools, designed to facilitate basic conversations between users. But as the technology evolved, so did the bots. Today, they are sophisticated programs, capable of understanding complex language, responding with intelligence and wit, and even learning from their interactions.</p>
  <h2>Concrete Examples: The Allure of Text Prompts</h2>
  <p>One company that has taken this technology to the next level is China's NetEase. The internet giant recently launched its own chatbot rival to Google's ChatGPT. But rather than focusing on complex AI algorithms, NetEase's product takes a simpler approach. It builds apps using text prompts, allowing users to create customized applications in minutes.</p>
  <p>For example, let's say you run a restaurant. You can use NetEase's app to create a chatbot that can take reservations, answer questions about your menu, and even place orders. All you need to do is enter a few prompts - "What would you like to order?", "What time would you like to make a reservation?" - and the app will take care of the rest.</p>
  <p>Another example is NetEase's chatbot platform for news organizations. With this tool, publishers can create bots that can provide readers with the latest headlines, alerts, and article summaries, all via chat. The bots can even answer questions about the stories, or provide background information.</p>
  <h2>An Eye-Catching Chatbots Are the Future of Digital Communication</h2>
  <p>It's clear that text-based chatbots are here to stay. They offer a powerful, flexible tool for businesses and consumers alike, and the technology is only getting better. Whether you're looking to make reservations, place orders, or keep up with the latest news, chatbots are fast becoming the go-to choice for digital communication.</p>
