   <h2>The Fascinating Story of Human-Computer Interaction</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>In a world where technology has advanced more rapidly than ever before, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become the most talked-about topic in recent years. Just as <a href="https://searchengineland.com/googles-algorithm-affecting-traffic-least-74708" target="_blank">Google's search algorithm</a> changed the way we look for information, AI is now changing the way we interact with technology.</p>
   <p>To illustrate the potential of AI, let us look at a real-life example. In 2011, IBM's Watson computer system competed against two human contestants on the game show Jeopardy, and won. This showcased the ability of machines to understand natural language, process vast amounts of data and reason with it.</p>
   <p>But it's not just about game shows or trivia. AI has the power to change the way we work, interact and live. Leading companies such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson" target="_blank">IBM Watson</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/assistant/" target="_blank">Google Assistant</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-And-Alexa-Devices/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=9818047011" target="_blank">Amazon Alexa</a> have already begun to disrupt various industries, including healthcare, finance, and retail.</p>
   <p>As amazing as AI technology may be, we need to be careful. We must keep an eye on the ethical and moral implications of AI and ensure there is transparency in the decision-making process. Nevertheless, the future of AI is highly promising, and we can expect to see more innovative applications that will change the way we live our lives.</p>
