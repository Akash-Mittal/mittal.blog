    <p>It was a typical Monday morning at KC Schools when Mark Condo walked in. However, the difference was, he wasn't a regular teacher. He was the new assistant superintendent. As he walked down the hallway, he noticed the chipped paint on the walls and the classroom doors that wouldn't shut properly. He knew that he had his work cut out for him.</p>
    <p>After a few weeks on the job, Mark discovered that there were larger issues at play. The students were struggling to learn in overcrowded classrooms with outdated technology. The teachers were exhausted and underpaid. Mark knew that he needed to make some changes, and fast.</p>
