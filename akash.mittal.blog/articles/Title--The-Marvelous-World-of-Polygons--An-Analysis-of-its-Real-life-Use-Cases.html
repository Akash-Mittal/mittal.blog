  <p>Have you ever looked at a stop sign or a book cover, and wondered how they were made? Have you ever wondered how they managed to look so good? Well, the answer lies in polygons �?? the building blocks of most 2D and 3D graphics.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The concept of polygons can be traced back to ancient civilizations, with the Babylonians being one of the first to use a system of "sexagesimal" numbers �?? based on sixty, which laid the foundation for modern computing. Fast forward a few millennia, and modern-day technology has taken the application of polygons to new heights.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Polygons have a variety of applications in the real world. They are used to create realistic graphics in video games and animated movies, intricate designs in jewelry, and complex patterns in fabrics. Polygon-based models have been used in architectural designs, allowing for the creation of realistic 3D models of buildings, and also in medical industry where doctors and researchers can get a better visualization of a human body.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One of the prominent examples of the use of polygons is in the development of Google Maps. Google Maps uses a technique called "tiling," which involves breaking up the map into small, square images that are then stitched together. Each image is made up of millions of tiny triangles, and Google Maps is comprised of millions and millions of these images. This makes it easier for users to zoom in and out of maps, without requiring too much loading time.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another company that uses polygons extensively is Pixar. Pixar has been responsible for some of the most iconic animated movies, and their renderings of complex 3D shapes, such as humans and animals, is remarkable. Their use of smooth curves, flowy hair, and intricate textures is only made possible through an extensive use of polygons.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, polygons have revolutionized the modern-day technology by providing a practical and versatile framework for creating graphics, 3D designs, and animations. From creating the stunning visuals in movies like Toy Story and Finding Nemo to assisting medical professionals with 3D printing human organs, polygons have an extensive range of applications.</p>
