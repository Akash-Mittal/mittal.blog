   <p>Imagine waking up one day to find that your country's currency has hyperinflated, leaving many people unable to afford basic needs. This scenario has played out in countries such as Venezuela and Zimbabwe, but could it happen to more developed nations?</p>
   <p>Enter Bitcoin, a decentralized form of currency that is immune to hyperinflation and government control. As the cryptocurrency industry continues to grow, it's important to consider its impact on the job market and how it is changing the way we work.</p>
   <p>Artificial intelligence is also becoming more prevalent in various industries, and it's not just manual jobs that are being replaced. White-collar jobs such as lawyers, accountants, and financial analysts could also be at risk of being automated.</p>
   <p>So, what does the future of the crypto biz hold? Here are three key points to consider:</p>
   <ol>
    <li><b>The rise of Bitcoin:</b> As more people start to lose faith in traditional currencies, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will continue to gain popularity. Companies such as Coinbase and Binance are leading the way in facilitating cryptocurrency transactions, and as the industry becomes more mainstream, we can expect to see more jobs in this sector.</li>
    <li><b>The impact of AI:</b> As artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated, more jobs will be replaced by machines. However, this also means that new jobs will be created in the tech sector, such as data scientists and AI engineers.</li>
    <li><b>The need for adaptability:</b> With the rapid pace of technological change, it's important for individuals and businesses to remain adaptable and open to new opportunities. Luddites will be left behind, while those who embrace change will thrive in the new economy.</li>
   </ol>
   <p>The future of the crypto biz is uncertain, but one thing is clear: change is happening, and we must be ready to adapt. As we move towards a more decentralized and automated future, it's up to us to ensure that we are prepared for whatever comes our way.</p>
