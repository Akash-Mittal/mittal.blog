   <p>Emily was excited to use her newly installed ChatGPT app on her smartphone. She was thrilled to have access to a range of features like voice, video, and group messaging. However, what she didn't realize was that this app was not the real one, but a malicious version disguised as ChatGPT.</p>
   <p>The impersonated app worked just like the original one but had some hidden functions that Emily wasn't aware of. Her personal information like contacts, passwords, and location was being tracked, and her conversations were being recorded. She didn't know that her phone was now infected with malware.</p>
   <p>This is not just Emily's story but has happened to thousands of people worldwide. Cybercriminals have found a new way to lure victims by creating fake apps and tricking them into downloading and installing the malware-infected version of popular apps like ChatGPT.</p>
   <p>In a report by CSO Online, it was found that this trend is on the rise, and people need to be cautious while installing any new app on their smartphones.</p>
   <h2>Real Life Examples</h2>
   <p>Recently, Google Play Store removed a fake ChatGPT app that was downloaded by over 10,000 people before it was detected. The app contained an adware script that displayed ads, collected data, and even drained the phone battery. The app creators made money by displaying ads and selling users' data to third parties.</p>
   <p>Another example is when the Indian Army reported that Chinese hackers were using fake Aarogya Setu apps to infiltrate and spy on Indian phones. The app looked, felt and worked like the genuine one, but the collected data was sent to Chinese-based servers.</p>

   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
