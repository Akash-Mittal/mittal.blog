    <h2>A Story of Frustration</h2>
    <p>It was just another lazy Sunday afternoon when Emily decided to check her Snapchat app. However, as soon as she opened it, she was taken aback by the changes. It seemed like the latest update had given her a newsfeed, full of stories and posts from strangers. The most frustrating thing was, she could hardly find the stories of her friends anymore!</p>
    <p>After a brief moment of trying to figure out the changes, she realized that Snapchat had added a new feature, called My AI. It was a personalized newsfeed that aimed to offer users the stories they would find interesting. Unfortunately, it seemed that Emily and many other users were not happy about it.</p>

    <h2>Concrete Examples of Users' Anger</h2>
    <p>Following the update, many Snapchat users expressed their frustration on Twitter and other social media platforms. Some users even went as far as flooding the App Store with negative reviews. Here are some of the examples:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>"What is happening to Snapchat? I can hardly find the stories of my friends anymore #BadUpdate #MyAI"</li>
     <li>"Snapchat, why did you fix something that was not broken? #BringBackOldSnapchat #MyAI"</li>
     <li>"My AI is the worst thing that happened to Snapchat. I don't need a newsfeed, I need my friends' stories #Uninstalling #NoAI"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Despite Snapchat's attempt to customize the user experience, it seemed that My AI was not well-received by many users. They felt like the update had taken away the original essence of Snapchat, which was all about the stories of their friends.</p>
