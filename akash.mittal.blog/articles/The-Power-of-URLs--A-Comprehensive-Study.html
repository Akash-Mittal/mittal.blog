     <h2>The URL that Changed Everything</h2>
     <p>On January 14, 2008, a seemingly innocuous tweet was sent out by a young entrepreneur named Jack Dorsey. "just setting up my twttr," he wrote, referring to a new social media platform that would soon take the world by storm.</p>
     <p>But it wasn't just the platform itself that would become a cultural phenomenon. It was also the URL that powered it: twitter.com. Short, sweet, and easy to remember, this URL became synonymous with the company and would eventually play a crucial role in its success.</p>

     <h2>Real-Life Examples of URL Power</h2>
     <p>Twitter is just one example of how a URL can make or break a brand. Consider the following:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>Amazon.com: The online giant's URL has become so ubiquitous that people often say "I'll just Amazon it" instead of "I'll search for it online."</li>
      <li>Google.com: The search engine's URL has become synonymous with finding information online. "Google it" is now a common refrain in everyday conversation.</li>
      <li>Facebook.com: While the company has undergone numerous controversies in recent years, its URL remains one of the most recognizable and widely-used on the internet.</li>
     </ul>

     <h2>The Importance of a Good URL</h2>
     <p>So why are URLs so important? For one thing, they impact a website's search engine ranking. If a URL is concise, descriptive, and contains relevant keywords, it's more likely to show up in search engine results pages (SERPs).</p>
     <p>Additionally, a clear and memorable URL can improve user experience and make it more likely that visitors will return to a site in the future. And as we've seen with Twitter, a strong URL can even become an integral part of a brand's identity.</p>
