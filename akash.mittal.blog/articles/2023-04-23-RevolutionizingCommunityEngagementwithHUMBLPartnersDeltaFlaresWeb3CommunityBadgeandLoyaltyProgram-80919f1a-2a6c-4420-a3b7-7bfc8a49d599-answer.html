  <p>Have you ever joined a community online but felt like you're not really a part of it? That you're just a passive observer with no real purpose there? This is a common issue for many people who participate in online communities. However, HUMBL Partners DeltaFlare's new web 3 community badge and loyalty program is set to change all that.</p>
  <p>A web 3 community badge is a unique digital badge that users can earn by contributing to a particular community. DeltaFlare's program rewards users for adding value to the community, whether that's through creating content, sharing knowledge, or engaging with others.</p>
  <p>This may sound like a small thing, but it has a big impact on community engagement. When users have a clear goal to work towards, they're more likely to engage with the community and contribute in meaningful ways. Plus, the badge serves as a visual representation of their contributions, which can instill a sense of pride and belonging.</p>
  <h2>Concrete Examples</h2>
  <p>Lynn joins a gardening community that's part of DeltaFlare's web 3 platform. She's a beginner gardener and has a lot of questions, but she's hesitant to ask because she doesn't want to seem clueless. However, once she learns about the community badge and sees that answering questions earns her points towards it, she starts engaging and asking questions without fear of judgment. Over time, she becomes an active member of the community who freely shares her knowledge with others.</p>
  <p>In another example, Alex is a member of a blockchain community that's part of DeltaFlare's platform. He'd like to start contributing code to the community, but he's not sure where to begin. However, once he sees that contributing code earns him a web 3 badge, he's motivated to start learning and contributing. He ends up creating a valuable piece of code that benefits the whole community.</p>
