   <p>Have you heard about the recent leak of a generative AI model by OpenAI? It was certainly a big news in the AI community. But what many people do not know is that companies are using generative AI models in various other ways as well. Let's explore some real-life examples.</p>
   <h2>1. The North Face</h2>
   <p>The North Face, an outdoor clothing and equipment brand, is using an AI-powered chatbot to help customers choose the right jacket for the right occasion. The chatbot asks a series of questions to understand the customer's preferences and needs, and then generates recommendations based on that data. This has not only improved customer experience, but has also reduced the number of returns due to wrong size or style choices.</p>
   <h2>2. Glitch</h2>
   <p>Glitch, a collaborative coding platform, is using a generative AI model to create new, unique soundscapes for its users. The model takes in user input such as keywords, themes, and moods, and generates a one-of-a-kind soundscape that can be used as a background for coding activities or relaxation.</p>
   <h2>3. Adobe</h2>
   <p>Adobe, the well-known software company, is using generative AI models to create and edit images for its users. For instance, its "Content-Aware Fill" feature allows users to remove an object from an image and automatically fills the empty space with background content that blends in seamlessly. Another example is its "Neural Filters" feature that applies different artistic styles to an image, based on the user's preferences.</p>
   <p>These are just a few examples of the many ways companies are using generative AI models to improve their products and services. While the recent leak by OpenAI raises concerns about the potential misuse of these models, it is important to also highlight their positive applications.</p>
