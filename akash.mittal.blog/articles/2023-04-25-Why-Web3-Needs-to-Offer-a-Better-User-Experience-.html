    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>Imagine you're a regular person who wants to invest in cryptocurrency, but you have no idea how to navigate the confusing world of blockchain and decentralized finance. You hear about Web3, the next generation of the internet that's supposed to make everything easier and more accessible, but when you try to use it, you're met with a frustrating and overwhelming user experience. You give up and decide that crypto is not for you.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, this scenario is not uncommon. Web3 has the potential to revolutionize industries and democratize access to information and services, but its poor user experience is holding it back.</p>

    <h2>Concrete Examples</h2>
    <p>Here are some examples of how Web3's user experience falls short:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Complicated wallet setups and confusing transaction processes prevent users from easily accessing and using their crypto.</li>
     <li>Decentralized applications (dApps) often have clunky interfaces and slow loading times, making it difficult to use them for everyday purposes.</li>
     <li>The lack of standardization in Web3 tools and protocols means that users have to constantly navigate different interfaces and learn new systems, which can be overwhelming.</li>
    </ul>
   </section>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>So, what needs to change for Web3 to attract more users?</p>
    <ol>
     <li>User-centered design: Web3 products need to prioritize user experience and create intuitive interfaces that are accessible to non-technical users.</li>
     <li>Standardization: Industry-wide standards and protocols need to be established to create a more cohesive Web3 ecosystem and reduce confusion for users.</li>
     <li>Education: To bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3, there needs to be more educational resources available to help users navigate the transition and understand the benefits of decentralized technology.</li>
    </ol>
