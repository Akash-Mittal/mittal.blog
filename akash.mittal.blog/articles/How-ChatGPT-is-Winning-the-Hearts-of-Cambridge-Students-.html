    <h2>The Interesting Story</h2>
    <p>It was a typical Monday morning and Emma, a first-year student at Cambridge, was struggling to understand a concept in her Economics course. She had tried reading the textbook, attending lectures, and even watching youtube videos but nothing seemed to make sense. As a last resort, she decided to give ChatGPT a try.</p>
    <p>ChatGPT is an AI-powered chatbot that can answer any academic or personal questions in a matter of seconds. It uses GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) AI model developed by OpenAI to understand and respond to natural language input.</p>
    <p>Emma was skeptical at first, but as soon as she started chatting with ChatGPT, she knew that this was the solution she was looking for. The chatbot not only understood her question but also provided her with a detailed explanation and relevant examples. Emma was amazed by how simple and easy it was to use ChatGPT and how quickly she could get the help she needed.</p>
    <p>Since that day, Emma has been using ChatGPT for all her academic and personal needs. She has recommended it to all her friends and classmates, and almost half of the Cambridge student population now use ChatGPT regularly. But how did ChatGPT become so popular among Cambridge students? Let's find out.</p>
