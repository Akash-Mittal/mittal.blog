    <h2 class="subheading">The Story Behind The Layoffs</h2>
    <p class="body-text">Last week, Dropbox CEO Drew Houston announced that the company would be laying off 11% of its workforce, amounting to about 500 employees. This decision came as a surprise to many, especially since Dropbox had been doing well financially. However, Houston stated that the layoffs were necessary for the company's long-term success and sustainability.</p>
    <p class="body-text">But what led to this decision? According to Houston, the COVID-19 pandemic played a significant role in the company's need to restructure. With more businesses shifting to remote work, Dropbox saw a surge in demand for its services. However, this also led to an increase in expenses, such as server costs and employee compensation. And with uncertainties about how long the pandemic will last, Houston believed it was better to act now.</p>

    <h2 class="subheading">Real-Life Examples</h2>
    <p class="body-text">Dropbox is not the only company that has had to make difficult decisions in the wake of the pandemic. Other tech giants such as Uber and Airbnb have also laid off thousands of employees. But smaller companies have not been immune either. Hustle, a startup that specializes in peer-to-peer texting, had to lay off 25% of its staff in June. The reason? The pandemic has caused many political campaigns to shift their focus away from texting and towards digital ads.</p>
    <p class="body-text">For some companies, the pandemic has actually led to increased business. For example, video conferencing software Zoom has seen enormous growth in the past few months. However, this growth has also brought challenges. In April, it was reported that Zoom had mistakenly given its users' data to Facebook. The company has since fixed the issue, but it highlights the risks of rapid expansion.</p>

    <h2 class="subheading">Critical Comments</h2>
    <ol class="body-text">
     <li>While the layoffs may be necessary for Dropbox's survival, it is still a difficult and painful decision for those affected. Losing a job during a pandemic can be devastating, both financially and emotionally.</li>
     <li>It remains to be seen if other tech companies will follow Dropbox's lead and begin to lay off workers. With the pandemic still ongoing, it is likely that more companies will need to make tough decisions about their workforce.</li>
     <li>Ultimately, this situation highlights the fragility of even the most successful companies in uncertain times. No business is immune to the effects of a global pandemic, and all must be willing to adapt and make tough decisions in order to survive.</li>
