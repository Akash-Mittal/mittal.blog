  <main>
   <p>Imagine a world where everything works seamlessly without any hiccups or downtime. A world where your personal assistant is a smart digital assistant that understands your needs and preferences better than you do. A world where your home is fully automated and responds to your voice commands. This is the world of technology that we are heading towards.</p>
   <p>As we move further down the path of digital transformation, technology is becoming an integral part of our lives. In this article, we delve into the latest trends and innovations in the world of technology through real-life examples and case studies.</p>
   <h3>Artificial Intelligence - The Future is Here</h3>
   <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been one of the most talked-about technologies in recent years. From chatbots to self-driving cars, AI has disrupted various industries and has made life easier for humans. One such example is the Watson Assistant by IBM.</p>
   <p>Watson Assistant is an AI-powered virtual assistant that uses natural language processing to understand and respond to customer queries. Hilton Worldwide has deployed Watson Assistant to provide personalized recommendations and information to their guests.</p>

   <h3>Cybersecurity - Protecting Your Digital Assets</h3>
   <p>With the increasing amount of data being generated and stored online, cybersecurity has become a critical aspect of technology. Cybercrimes such as data breaches, ransomware attacks, and phishing scams have affected millions of people worldwide. One such example is the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017.</p>
   <p>The WannaCry ransomware attack infected over 200,000 computers in 150 countries and caused an estimated $4 billion in damages. This attack highlighted the need for robust cybersecurity measures and the importance of keeping software up to date.</p>

   <h3>Big Data - The Power of Data Analytics</h3>
   <p>Big Data has revolutionized the way we collect, store, and analyze data. With the advent of machine learning and AI, businesses can now make better-informed decisions based on data insights. One such example is Netflix.</p>
   <p>Netflix uses big data and predictive analytics to recommend personalized content to its users. By analyzing user behavior and preferences, Netflix can suggest TV shows and movies that are most likely to be of interest to the user.</p>
