   <p>On a recent episode of Fox News Video, President Biden shocked viewers by asking ChatGPT, an AI chatbot, a question about the COVID-19 pandemic. The comment section of the video exploded with both outrage and admiration for the President's unique use of technology.</p>
   <p>As we dive deeper into this story, we'll explore the real-life impact of AI chatbots on society and how they're being used by companies and governments alike. Let's take a closer look at some of the main players:</p>
   <h2>Amazon</h2>
   <p>Amazon's AI chatbot, Alexa, has become a household name. Users can ask Alexa to play music, set timers, and even make purchases. However, the technology has underscored important questions about privacy and data collection.</p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lex/">Learn more about Amazon's AI chatbot Lex</a>

   <h2>Government</h2>
   <p>Governments are also utilizing AI chatbots to streamline services and reduce costs.

   <p>While there are certainly benefits to using AI chatbots, there are also potential pitfalls. For example, chatbots may not be able to provide accurate information or empathy in certain situations. Additionally, there are concerns about job loss as companies automate customer service roles.</p>

    <li>AI chatbots are becoming increasingly prevalent in both the private and public sectors.</li>
    <li>Despite their benefits, there are also potential drawbacks and ethical concerns to consider.</li>
