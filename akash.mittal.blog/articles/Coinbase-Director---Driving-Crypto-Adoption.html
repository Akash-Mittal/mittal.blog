    <h2>The Road to Making Cryptocurrency Mainstream</h2>
    <p>It was 2013 when the world first learned about Bitcoin. And while the idea of a decentralised digital-currency sounded enticing, most people were hesitant about investing in something they couldn't hold in their hands. It took a few years, but in 2017, the cryptocurrency market started gaining mainstream attention. People were making millions off Bitcoin, and the world was finally ready to embrace the idea of digital assets.</p>
    <p>That's also the year when the director of Coinbase, Balaji Srinivasan, stepped up to the plate. He believed in the potential of cryptocurrency, and his mission was to make it accessible to the masses. Srinivasan wanted to push the boundaries of traditional finance and bring the world closer to adopting a new way of transacting.</p>

   <section id="real-examples">
    <h2>Real-Life Examples of Srinivasan's Contributions</h2>
    <p>One of Srinivasan's first initiatives was to simplify the process of buying cryptocurrency. Coinbase, under his leadership, introduced a user-friendly app that made it easy for anyone to invest in digital assets. It removed the technical jargon and made the process as simple as buying stocks on a traditional exchange.</p>
    <p>Another hurdle in the adoption of cryptocurrency was the lack of trust between buyers and sellers. Srinivasan's team addressed this issue by establishing a robust security protocol that safeguarded user funds. They implemented a multi-layered security system that included features such as two-factor authentication, cold storage, and insurance coverage.</p>
    <p>As the demand for cryptocurrency grew, Srinivasan's team expanded Coinbase's offerings to include a variety of digital assets. They even introduced an API that allowed developers to build applications on top of the Coinbase platform.</p>
    <p>Srinivasan's vision didn't stop there. In 2018, he launched Coinbase Earn, a platform that offered users incentives for learning about different cryptocurrencies. It was a win-win situation for both the users and the crypto-community as a whole. Users got rewarded for educating themselves about cryptocurrency, and the community gained new members who understood the potential of digital assets.</p>
    <p>Through such initiatives, Srinivasan has contributed to driving crypto adoption and making digital assets accessible to the masses.</p>
