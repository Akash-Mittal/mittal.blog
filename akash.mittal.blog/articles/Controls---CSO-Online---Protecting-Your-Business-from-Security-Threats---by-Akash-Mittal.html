   <h2>The Importance of Controls in Cybersecurity</h2>
  </header>
  <article>
   <p>It was a seemingly normal day at the office until the company's servers suddenly crashed. Panic set in as employees realized they no longer had access to important files, data and applications. Upon further examination, it was discovered that the servers had been hacked and all data had been stolen.</p>
   <p>In today's digital age, cybersecurity is more important than ever. Cyber criminals are constantly finding new ways to compromise networks, steal data and wreak havoc on our businesses. However, with proper controls in place, companies can protect themselves from these attacks.</p>
   <p>Real life examples of companies with effective cybersecurity controls include Google, Microsoft and Amazon. Google's security team constantly monitors the company's networks for any unusual activity, and they are quick to respond to any potential threats. Microsoft has implemented multi-factor authentication and other security measures to protect their users' data. Amazon Web Services provides customers with a variety of security tools and features to help them secure their data and applications.</p>
   <p>By using controls such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, access controls and encryption, companies can fortify their networks and keep them secure from malicious actors. These controls are essential in protecting sensitive data and preventing security breaches.</p>

    <p><strong>3 Critical Comments:</strong></p>
    <ol>
     <li>While controls are necessary for cybersecurity, they are not foolproof and should not be relied on exclusively. Companies should also have a comprehensive cybersecurity plan that includes employee training, incident response planning and regular security assessments.</li>
     <li>Cybersecurity is a constantly evolving field, and companies must stay up-to-date with the latest threats and trends in order to effectively protect their networks and data.</li>
     <li>While larger companies like Google and Microsoft have the resources to implement advanced cybersecurity controls, smaller companies may face challenges in this area due to limited budgets and IT staff. However, there are still measures that small businesses can take to protect themselves, such as implementing firewall and antivirus software, training employees on cybersecurity best practices and regularly backing up data.</li>
