   <p>John was a high school student who always struggled with math. Despite his best efforts, he couldn't seem to score higher than a C on his exams. Feeling discouraged, he told his teacher, "I'm just not good at math." His teacher responded with a question that changed everything: "Do you think you're not good at math, or do you just not understand it yet?"</p>
   <p>Adding the word "yet" to your vocabulary can have a profound impact on your performance and success. It embodies the idea of a growth mindset, which is the belief that intelligence and abilities can be developed over time through hard work and dedication.</p>
   <div class="example">
    <p>For example, instead of saying, "I'm not a good public speaker," try saying, "I'm not a good public speaker yet." This small shift in language can make all the difference. It acknowledges that public speaking is a skill that can be improved with practice and experience.</p>
   </div>
   <p>Another example is in the workplace. Instead of saying, "I don't know how to do that job," try saying, "I don't know how to do that job yet." This demonstrates a willingness to learn and grow, which can be highly valued by employers.</p>
   <div class="example">
    <p>One more example is in personal goals. Instead of saying, "I can't run a marathon," try saying, "I can't run a marathon yet." This creates a sense of possibility and potential instead of limitation and defeat.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="conclusion">
    <p>Using the word "yet" can:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Promote a growth mindset.</li>
     <li>Cultivate a willingness to learn and improve.</li>
     <li>Create a sense of potential and possibility.</li>
    </ol>
