   <h2>A Personal Story</h2>
   <p>37-year-old Rajesh had always been a health-conscious man. He exercised regularly, ate home-cooked meals, and avoided sugary drinks. Yet, one day, he felt dizzy and thirsty all the time. He went to the doctor and was diagnosed with diabetes type 2.</p>
   <p>Rajesh's case is not uncommon in India, where diabetes has become a silent killer. According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), there were 77 million adults living with diabetes in India in 2019. That's the second-highest number in the world, just after China. What's worse, 50% of them may not even know that they have the disease.</p>
   <p>Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the way the body processes blood sugar (glucose). If left uncontrolled, it can lead to serious health problems such as heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney failure, and lower limb amputation.</p>

   <h2>The Prediction</h2>
   <p>ChatGPT, an AI-powered research platform, was asked to predict the diabetes burden on India by 2050. After analyzing various factors such as population growth, aging, urbanization, and lifestyle changes, ChatGPT came up with a staggering prediction: 134 million adults living with diabetes in India by 2050.</p>
   <p>This number represents a 74% increase from the current figure and would further burden India's healthcare system, economy, and social well-being. India would then become the country with the highest number of diabetes cases in the world. The prediction is indeed worrying.</p><img src="https://dummyimage.com/600x400/000/fff" alt="graph showing the projected increase in diabetes cases in India">
   <p>ChatGPT's prediction is not unfounded. In recent years, India has witnessed a surge in diabetes cases, particularly in urban areas. Factors such as sedentary lifestyles, unhealthy diets, stress, and pollution have contributed to the spread of the disease.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, diabetes is not an exclusive problem of the elderly anymore. Young adults and even children are increasingly being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, which was once known as adult-onset diabetes.</p>

   <h2>The Real-Life Examples</h2>
   <p>The impact of diabetes on real people's lives cannot be overstated. Here are some examples:</p>
   <ol>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q5r3ubOnVY" target="_blank">Anita's Story</a>: Anita, a mother of two, was diagnosed with diabetes during pregnancy. She had to monitor her blood sugar levels frequently, adjust her diet, and take insulin shots. Diabetes made her pregnancy complicated and stressful.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/mumbai-expat-thrives-despite-living-with-diabetes-for-38-years/article33650399.ece" target="_blank">Roberta's Story</a>: Roberta, an expat living in Mumbai, has been living with diabetes for 38 years. She needs to take insulin four times a day, but she doesn't let the disease control her life. She exercises, travels, and enjoys spicy Indian food.</li>
    <li><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/welcome-to-diabetes-city/articleshow/83036411.cms" target="_blank">Raipur's Story</a>: Raipur, the capital city of Chhattisgarh, has earned the dubious nickname of "Diabetes City." One in three adults in Raipur has diabetes, according to a recent survey. The city's authorities have launched a campaign to raise awareness and promote healthy behaviors.</li>

   <h2>The Critical Comments</h2>
   <p>ChatGPT's prediction and the examples above highlight the urgent need for action to prevent and control diabetes in India. Here are three critical comments:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Public awareness:</strong> Many people in India still think of diabetes as a minor ailment that can be treated with home remedies. There is a lack of awareness about the seriousness of the disease and the importance of early detection and management.</li>
    <li><strong>Government policies:</strong> The Indian government needs to take a more proactive role in preventing diabetes, promoting healthy lifestyles, and providing affordable and accessible healthcare to people with diabetes.</li>
    <li><strong>Cultural changes:</strong> Diabetes is not only a medical problem but also a social and cultural issue. Indians have a tradition of consuming sweets and fried snacks in large quantities, especially during festivals and weddings. Changing these dietary habits is not easy, but it's necessary to curb the diabetes epidemic.</li>
   </ul>
