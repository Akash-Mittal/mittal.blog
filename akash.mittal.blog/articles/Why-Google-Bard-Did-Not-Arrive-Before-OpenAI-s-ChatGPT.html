   <p>Once upon a time, there were two companies - Google and OpenAI - that were striving to create an AI language model that can generate human-like responses to conversational queries. Google was working on Bard and OpenAI was working on ChatGPT. Both the models had their pros and cons, but the latter gained popularity faster and outshined Bard as the go-to model for conversational AI. So, what went wrong with Bard? Why did it not arrive before ChatGPT?</p>
   <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
   <p>Google Bard was designed to use a completely different approach to generate conversational responses than traditional models. It relied on generating responses from a large-scale training dataset of text paired with images. With this, Google hoped to develop an intelligent AI that can understand both verbal and visual cues and could be used in various applications. However, the challenge was to train the model for a large number of parameters while keeping the computational cost relatively low.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, OpenAI's ChatGPT was based on a transformer architecture and could be fine-tuned based on the user's specific needs. This gave ChatGPT an edge over Bard in terms of flexibility and customization as it could generate responses depending on the context of the query. Moreover, ChatGPT was capable of generating realistic language and responses to a wide range of queries, including philosophical questions and stylistic literary texts. This made ChatGPT a powerful tool for chatbots, search engines, and virtual assistants.</p>
   <p>As a result, companies like Microsoft, Facebook, and Google chose ChatGPT for their conversational AI applications over Bard, which required more complex training and computational resources.</p>
   <h2>The Main Companies Involved</h2>
   <p>Google and OpenAI were the two main companies involved in the development of Google Bard and OpenAI's ChatGPT, respectively.</p>
   <p>Google's project was led by Jakob Uszkoreit, a Natural Language Processing researcher, while OpenAI's project was headed by Sam Altman, the CEO of the company. Both the companies had different approaches, and while Google Bard focused on audio and visual datasets to make responses, OpenAI's ChatGPT focused on language models to generate conversations.</p>
   <p>Microsoft, Facebook, and Google adopted ChatGPT for their conversational AI applications, while Google did not launch Bard yet. However, Google is still researching on how to make its AI model more suitable for text-to-image applications.</p>
   <h2>Critical Comments</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Google Bard's approach towards generating responses was innovative and had the potential to revolutionize conversational AI. However, it was too complex and resource-intensive, which made it less practical.</li>
    <li>OpenAI's ChatGPT was more flexible and efficient in generating responses, which gave it an edge over Bard.</li>
    <li>Google may still have a chance to bring Bard in the future as they continue their research in the field of text-to-image conversion.</li>
   </ul>
