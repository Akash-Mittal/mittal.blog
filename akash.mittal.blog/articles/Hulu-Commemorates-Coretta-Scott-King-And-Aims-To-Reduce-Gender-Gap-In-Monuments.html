    <p>Walking down the streets of Washington D.C., a group of tourists stumble upon a statue of Coretta Scott King. One of them turns to the guide and asks, "Who is she?" The guide replies, "She was an advocate for civil rights and the wife of Martin Luther King Jr." The tourist nods and takes a picture, but little does he know the struggle women face in being represented in monuments and memorials.</p>
    <p>In recent years, there has been a push to eliminate the gender gap in monuments, as only 8% of U.S. monuments depict a woman. Hulu, the popular streaming platform, has taken up this cause and pledged to support the creation of monuments and experiences that celebrate women's contributions to society. In addition, Hulu is partnering with historians, artists, and cultural institutions to help tell the stories of the unsung female heroes of the past, present, and future.</p>
    <p>Other major companies have also made efforts to promote gender equality in monuments. Apple funded a large-scale monument depicting Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, two pioneers of the women's suffrage movement, which was unveiled in Central Park in 2020. Google has also launched an online collection of historic women's stories, called "Women Will," which provides resources for educators and students to learn about women's contributions throughout history.</p>
    <p>These initiatives are a step towards a more inclusive society, but there is still work to be done. Women have been overlooked in the historical narrative for far too long, and it is important to acknowledge and celebrate their contributions. Through efforts like these, we can ensure that women's stories are told and inspire future generations.</p>
