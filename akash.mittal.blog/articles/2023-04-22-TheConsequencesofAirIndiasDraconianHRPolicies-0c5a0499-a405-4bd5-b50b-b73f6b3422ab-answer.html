    <h2 id="story">The Story</h2>
    <p>Air India, once one of the most successful airlines in India, has been struggling in recent years. One of the reasons for its downfall could be its HR policies that have been labeled as "draconian" by many. These policies have been in strong contrast to the principles followed by JRD Tata, who envisioned Air India as a company that would care for its employees, and his successor Ratan Tata, who emphasized the importance of employee satisfaction.</p>
    <p>Reports suggest that Air India's HR policies are not employee-friendly. The company has a history of frequently transferring its employees without their consent, denying leave applications without valid reasons, and even terminating their services without any prior notice. Such policies have resulted in a disheartened and demotivated workforce that is unlikely to deliver exceptional customer service.</p>

    <h2 id="examples">Concrete Examples</h2>
    <p>One of the most noteworthy examples of Air India's inconsiderate HR policies was the way that employees were treated during the company's merger with Indian Airlines. The employees of both airlines were unsure about their job security, and the management provided them with no clarity regarding their future prospects. In addition, Air India took a hardline stance and gave them a mere 15 days to accept the new transfer orders. Those who refused to accept them were terminated immediately, without any settlement or compensation.</p>
    <p>Some other examples of Air India's poor HR policies are:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Rejecting leave applications without legitimate reasons, creating a sense of fear and uncertainty.</li>
     <li>Transferring employees frequently and without their consent, which disrupted their lives and families.</li>
     <li>Denying the payment of salaries and other entitlements, which led to protests and strikes by employees.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, it can be said that Air India's HR policies have deviated from the principles laid down by its founders, JRD and Ratan Tata. The company's focus on profitability and cost-cutting has led to an environment where employees feel demotivated and dissatisfied. It is high time that Air India reconsiders its HR policies and ensures that they are employee-friendly, for they are the backbone of the company.</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Air India's HR policies need an overhaul for employee satisfaction.</li>
     <li>The company should follow the principles laid down by JRD Tata and Ratan Tata to prioritize workers.</li>
     <li>Emphasize employee satisfaction to create a loyal and motivated workforce that delivers exceptional customer service.</li>
    </ul>
