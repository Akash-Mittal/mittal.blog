  <p>Once upon a time, ChatGPT was just a small chatbot company started by a young entrepreneur. Fast forward a few years later, and ChatGPT has now become one of the most popular bots on the market. Its success is not only due to its advanced technology, but also its unique business model.</p>
  <p>Unlike its competitors, ChatGPT relies heavily on contractors who are paid $15/hour to provide customer support and improve the bot's capabilities. This model has allowed the company to operate on a lean budget while still providing quality service to its customers.</p>
  <h2>Real Life Examples</h2>
  <p>One example of ChatGPT's success is its partnership with Lyft. The ride-hailing company uses ChatGPT to communicate with its drivers and customers. ChatGPT's contractors provide support to Lyft users and help maximize the efficiency of Lyft's operations.</p>
  <p>Another example is ChatGPT's work with the US Army. The bot is used to answer questions and provide support to military personnel and their families. Because ChatGPT is available 24/7, troops can get the information they need at any time, from anywhere in the world.</p>
  <h2>Main Companies</h2>
  <p>Lyft - <a href="https://www.lyft.com/">https://www.lyft.com/</a></p>
