    <p>Imagine a world where every job is automated, from factory worker to surgeon. The robots work tirelessly, without need of rest and with unwavering precision, freeing humanity from the drudgery of work. What could possibly go wrong?</p>
    <p>As it turns out, quite a lot. While artificial intelligence (AI) and ChatGPT may seem like the answer to our problems, they are not the cure-all solution that some make them out to be. In fact, they may actually be hindering the progress of transformative work in some ways.</p>

    <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
    <p>Take, for example, the case of Amazon's chatbot recruitment tool. The AI-powered system was designed to screen job applicants and identify the best candidates. However, it quickly became apparent that the algorithm was biased against women, due to the fact that most of the successful candidates in the past had been men.</p>
    <p>Another example is Uber's self-driving cars. While the technology has the potential to revolutionize the transportation industry, there have been several accidents involving autonomous vehicles, raising questions about their safety and the need for human oversight.</p>
    <p>These examples highlight the limitations and potential dangers of relying too heavily on AI and ChatGPT for world-changing transformative work.</p>

    <ol>
     <li>AI and ChatGPT are not infallible and can be biased, leading to unintended consequences.</li>
     <li>There is still a need for human oversight in world-changing transformative work, as technology alone cannot solve all of our problems.</li>
     <li>While AI and ChatGPT have the potential to be great tools for transformative work, it is important to proceed with caution and acknowledge their limitations.</li>
