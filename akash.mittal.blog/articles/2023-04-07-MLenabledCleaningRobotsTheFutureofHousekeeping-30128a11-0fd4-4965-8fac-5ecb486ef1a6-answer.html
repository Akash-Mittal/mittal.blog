   <p>Alexandra had always been someone who took pride in keeping her home spotless. She would spend hours every weekend cleaning, sweeping, and dusting every nook and cranny of her apartment. However, as she moved up the corporate ladder, she found that she no longer had the time or energy to keep her home as clean as she wanted it to be. That was until she discovered the wonders of cleaning robots.</p>
   <p>At first, Alexandra was skeptical. She had heard horror stories of robots malfunctioning and making a bigger mess than they were meant to clean up. But then, she stumbled upon a cleaning robot that was powered by machine learning. This robot was equipped with advanced sensors and algorithms that allowed it to navigate around her apartment and clean every surface with precision and care.</p>
   <section>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>The Roomba i7+ robot vacuum can clean an entire level of a home, and it uses machine learning to map out the floor plan and avoid obstacles.</li>
     <li>The Ecovacs Deebot N79S robot vacuum can be controlled by voice using Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant, and it uses sensors to detect and navigate around furniture.</li>
     <li>The Neato Botvac Connected D7 robot vacuum uses lasers to scan and map out a home, and it can be controlled through a smartphone app.</li>
    </ul>
   </section>
   <p>Now, Alexandra's home is cleaner than ever before. She no longer has to spend hours every weekend cleaning, and she can enjoy her free time doing the things she loves. ML-enabled cleaning robots are changing the game of housekeeping, and they are becoming more affordable and accessible with each passing year.</p>
