   <p>It's a well-known fact that scammers are always on the lookout for new ways to deceive unsuspecting victims. However, it seems that some crooks are turning back to the old-fashioned con, without the help of AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT.</p>
   <p>One such example is a recent case of a fraudulent scheme that targeted small business owners in the UK. The scammers approached the victims with a tempting offer to invest in a new product, promising high returns. In return, the victims were asked to provide their bank account details and make a deposit to secure their place. Unfortunately, the product was non-existent, and the crooks disappeared with their money.</p>
   <p>Another example comes from the US, where a tech support scam targeted elderly people. The crooks posed as representatives of a well-known tech company and claimed that the victim's computer was infected with a dangerous virus. They then asked the victim to pay for a software program that would allegedly remove the virus. In reality, the software was useless, and the crooks had access to the victim's personal information.</p>
   <p>Both cases show that scammers don't need fancy chatbots to trick their victims. They rely on the same old tactics of offering something too good to be true, creating a sense of urgency, and exploiting the victim's trust.</p>
   <p>The sad truth is that these scams are still prevalent, despite the efforts of law enforcement agencies and consumer protection groups. So, it's up to individuals to protect themselves by being vigilant and informed.</p>
