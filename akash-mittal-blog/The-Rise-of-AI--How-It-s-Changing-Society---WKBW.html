    <h3>The Chatbot that Changed Everything</h3>
    <p>In 2016, Facebook introduced its Messenger Platform, which allowed businesses to create chatbots to interact with customers. One of the first companies to take advantage of this new technology was Sephora, a cosmetics retailer.</p>
    <p>They launched a chatbot that customers could use to find products based on their preferences and order them directly through the bot. The bot could also provide tips and tutorials on makeup application.</p>
    <p>The response was overwhelming. Customers loved the convenience of being able to shop through Facebook Messenger, and Sephora saw an increase in sales and customer satisfaction. The success of this chatbot paved the way for other companies to follow suit.</p>
