  <p></p>
  <p>As I drive down a dirt road leading to a cattle ranch in Texas, I can't help but appreciate the vastness of the land and the hard work that goes into raising cattle. The sun is setting, and the rancher, Sam, and I are discussing the current state of the beef industry.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Sam tells me that the recent report shows that the cash cattle market is steady to 2 higher, while the cattle on feed (COF) report shows a decrease of 3%. This news is encouraging for ranchers like Sam, who have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic and its ripple effects.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable Examples:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The cash cattle market has been volatile, to say the least, as a result of the pandemic. However, according to the USDA, the cash cattle market has been steady to 2 higher in recent weeks, with an average of $1.11 per pound for live cattle and $1.78 per pound for dressed cattle.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The COF report shows a decrease of 3%, which is important because it indicates that fewer cattle are being placed into feedlots, which could eventually lead to a decrease in supply and an increase in prices.</p>

  <p>1. Despite the challenges of the pandemic, the beef industry is resilient and continues to produce high-quality beef.</p>
  <p>2. The recent cash cattle market and COF reports are encouraging signs for ranchers and consumers alike.</p>
  <p>3. As the industry continues to navigate the pandemic, it is important to support local ranchers and buy beef that is raised sustainably and ethically.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>As a meat lover, I've always been curious about the beef industry and how it operates. Meeting with Sam, a rancher with years of experience, gave me a newfound appreciation for the hard work that goes into raising cattle and producing high-quality beef.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Sam told me about the challenges of the pandemic, from supply chain disruptions to decreased demand for beef products. Despite these challenges, he remains optimistic about the future of the industry and is confident that it will continue to produce some of the best beef in the world.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Practical Tips:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Support local ranchers by buying beef that is raised sustainably and ethically. Look for labels that indicate the beef is grass-fed or pasture-raised, and ask questions about how the animals are treated.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Consider buying in bulk or joining a meat CSA to save money and support local agriculture. Many ranchers offer discounts for larger purchases, and a meat CSA allows you to receive a variety of cuts of meat each month.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Try new recipes and cuts of beef to support the industry and add some variety to your diet. Don't be afraid to ask your local butcher or rancher for recommendations on how to best prepare different cuts.</p>
