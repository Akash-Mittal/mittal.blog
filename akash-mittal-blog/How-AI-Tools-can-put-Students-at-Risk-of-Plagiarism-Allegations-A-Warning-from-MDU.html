    <p>John is a college student who is struggling to complete a research paper on time. He turns to an AI writing tool to help him finish the task quicker, but little does he know that it can lead to plagiarism allegations from his professor.</p>

    <p>According to a survey conducted by Turnitin, a plagiarism detection tool, there has been an increase in the use of AI-powered writing tools, and more than 25% of the students who use these tools have received plagiarism warnings from their professors.</p>
    <p>In another study, a group of scientists found that several paraphrasing tools, which use AI to rewrite text, tend to produce substandard content unfit for academic purposes, while others still produce accurate paraphrases but are still prone to plagiarism allegations if not used carefully.</p>

    <h2>Why AI Tools Can Be Risky</h2>
    <p>The reason behind the growth of AI-powered writing tools is the convenience they provide to students, as they can help them save time and effort in researching and writing long assignments. However, these tools can pose serious risks to academic integrity and reputation, as they tempt students who lack necessary writing skills or have hectic schedules to resort to content scraping, copying someone else's work, or taking shortcuts instead of learning.</p>
    <p>Moreover, as AI tools generate texts that are functionally similar to the source materials, it can be challenging for instructors to detect plagiarism, leading to a suspicion of academic dishonesty, which can affect the student's academic or professional pursuits negatively. This is why the Medical Defence Union (MDU) warns students against the dangers of using AI-powered writing tools indiscriminately.</p>

    <h2>How Students Can Avoid Plagiarism Allegations</h2>
    <p>Although AI tools can be helpful in many ways, they are not substitutes for authentic learning experiences, academic skills, or critical thinking, which are essential in avoiding plagiarism and maintaining academic integrity.</p>
    <p>Therefore, to avoid plagiarism allegations, students can take several critical measures, including:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Cite all sources correctly and consistently</li>
     <li>Understand the assignment instructions and write in their words</li>
     <li>Avoid procrastination and allow enough time to research and write</li>
     <li>Use AI tools only as a supplement, not a replacement for their efforts</li>
    </ol>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>To sum up, AI tools may offer some benefits to students, including convenience, speed, and accuracy in writing assignments, but if used indiscriminately, they can put them at risk of plagiarism allegations and hurt their academic or professional reputation.</p>
    <p>Therefore, it is crucial for students to be aware of the dangers of relying solely on AI tools and take the necessary actions to cultivate essential academic skills, avoid plagiarism, and maintain academic integrity.</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Avoid relying too heavily on AI tools, and use them only for supplementary purposes</li>
     <li>Learn, Practice and master basic academic writing skills, including citation and paraphrasing</li>
     <li>Be mindful of the risks of plagiarism and take preventative measures to avoid it</li>
    </ol>
