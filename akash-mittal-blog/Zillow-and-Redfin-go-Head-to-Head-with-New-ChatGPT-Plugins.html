   <p>When Sarah was in the market for a new home, she turned to popular real estate websites Zillow and Redfin for help. However, she found herself getting overwhelmed by the amount of information she had to sift through. That was until she discovered ChatGPT. This new plugin, powered by artificial intelligence, allowed her to converse with a virtual assistant to get personalized recommendations and answers to her questions.</p>
   <p>As it turns out, Sarah was not the only one impressed by ChatGPT. Zillow and Redfin have both recently integrated the plugin into their websites to improve the user experience. With ChatGPT, users can ask the virtual assistant questions, get personalized recommendations, and even set up home tours.</p>
   <p>The integration of ChatGPT into the real estate websites of Zillow and Redfin is just one example of how artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the industry. Here are three key takeaways from the developments:</p>
   <ol>
    <li><a href="https://www.zillow.com/">Zillow</a> and <a href="https://www.redfin.com/">Redfin</a> are two leading competitors in the real estate market. By integrating ChatGPT into their websites, both companies are seeking to improve the user experience and gain an edge over the other.</li>
    <li>The integration of artificial intelligence into the real estate industry is not new. However, ChatGPT takes it to the next level by allowing for personalized interactions and recommendations.</li>
    <li>ChatGPT has the potential to completely change the way people search for and purchase homes. With its ability to interact with users in a conversational manner, it provides a more human-like experience.</li>
   </ol>
