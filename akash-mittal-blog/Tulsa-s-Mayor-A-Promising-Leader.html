   <p>It was a sunny afternoon in downtown Tulsa when I first met the city's mayor, G.T. Bynum. I was walking around the city center, admiring the beautiful art deco buildings and the vibrant atmosphere, when I saw a man in a suit riding a bike. He stopped in front of me and said, "Hi, I'm G.T. Bynum, the mayor of Tulsa. How can I help you?"</p>
   <p>I was taken aback by the mayor's friendliness and approachability. I introduced myself and mentioned that I was a journalist covering local politics. He smiled and said, "Great, I would love to chat with you. How about we grab some coffee and talk about Tulsa's future?"</p>
   <p>That conversation with Mayor Bynum was one of the most inspiring moments of my career. He talked passionately about his vision for Tulsa, which included boosting the economy, creating jobs, improving the education system, and making the city more livable for all residents. What struck me the most was the mayor's humility and dedication to serving the people of Tulsa. He clearly didn't see himself as an authority figure, but as a public servant who had a responsibility to make Tulsa a better place.</p>
   <p>Fast forward a year later, and Mayor Bynum is making good on his promises. Under his leadership, the city's economy is thriving, with an unemployment rate of just 4.1%. Tulsa is also becoming a hub for tech and entrepreneurship, with startups like Mainsail and Joovv calling the city home. In addition, the mayor has launched several initiatives to improve education, including the Tulsa TIP program, which provides financial assistance to students attending Tulsa Community College.</p>
   <p>But perhaps what sets Mayor Bynum apart from other leaders is his commitment to making Tulsa a more diverse and inclusive city. He understands that in order to attract top talent and businesses, Tulsa needs to be welcoming to people of all backgrounds. That's why he launched the Tulsa Equality Indicators, a data-driven initiative that measures the city's progress in areas such as LGBTQ rights, racial and ethnic equity, and immigrant and refugee integration. Through this initiative, Mayor Bynum hopes to create a city where everyone feels valued and supported.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, Mayor G.T. Bynum is a promising leader who embodies the values of servant leadership. He is a humble and approachable figure who cares deeply about the city of Tulsa and its citizens. Under his leadership, Tulsa is becoming a more prosperous, innovative, and inclusive city. If you're ever in Tulsa, I highly recommend chatting with the mayor and seeing firsthand what makes him such a special leader.</p>
