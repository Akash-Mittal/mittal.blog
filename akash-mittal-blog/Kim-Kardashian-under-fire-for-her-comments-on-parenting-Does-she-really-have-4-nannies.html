   <p>Parenting is a tough job and everyone has their own way of dealing with it. However, when you are a celebrity and have millions of followers, your comments and actions are always under scrutiny. Recently, Kim Kardashian has been in the news for her controversial comments on parenting and allegations of her use of 4 nannies. Let's take a closer look at what's going on.</p>
   <h2>The Controversial Comments</h2>
   <p>In a recent interview, Kim Kardashian talked about her parenting style and how she doesn't believe in being a strict mom. She said, "I am definitely way more laid back. My kids are good kids; they are not such bad kids." Her comments received a lot of backlash from parents who criticized her for being too indulgent and not setting proper boundaries for her children.</p>
   <h2>The Allegations of 4 Nannies</h2>
   <p>While Kim Kardashian has not confirmed or denied the allegations of her use of 4 nannies, it has been reported by various sources that she has a team of nannies to take care of her children. Some reports even suggest that each of her children has their own personal nanny. While having help with childcare is not unusual for celebrities, the idea of having 4 nannies for 4 children has raised some eyebrows.</p>
   
   <p>According to a survey conducted by Care.com, the average number of nannies a family hires is 1.6. Having 4 nannies is definitely not the norm and raises questions about Kim Kardashian's parenting style and her ability to handle her own children without outside help.</p>
   
   <p>As a working mother myself, I understand the importance of having help with childcare. However, I also believe that raising children is one of the most fulfilling experiences of life and should not be completely outsourced. While having nannies can provide some relief and support, it should not be a substitute for quality time and attention from parents.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>After reviewing the controversy surrounding Kim Kardashian's parenting style and use of 4 nannies, it is clear that there are valid concerns. Here are 3 key takeaways:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Parenting is a personal choice and there is no right or wrong way to do it. However, it is important to set proper boundaries and provide guidance to children.</li>
    <li>Having help with childcare is not unusual for busy parents, but it should not be a substitute for quality time and attention from parents.</li>
    <li>Celebrities, like everyone else, should be mindful of their comments and actions as they have a powerful influence on their followers.</li>
