    <p>In the early hours of a Saturday morning, a group of young football players gathered on the oval. They were there to train in the hopes of becoming professional AFL players. Among the group was a young girl, Lily, who was the only girl in her team. The boys had always overlooked her, but she was determined to prove them wrong.</p>
    <p>During the training session, the coach noticed that Lily seemed to be struggling with the drills. He asked her to stay behind after the session. She was scared, thinking she had done something wrong. But the coach had other plans.</p>
    <p>He told Lily about a new program the Adelaide Football Club had launched, the Kuwa Circles Program. It was a mentorship program that aimed to provide support and guidance to young football players from diverse backgrounds. The coach thought it would be an excellent opportunity for Lily to gain confidence, build relationships, and develop her skills.</p>
    <p>Lily was amazed. She had always felt like an outsider in her team. But now, she was being given a chance to shine.</p>
