  <p>As parents, we know how important it is to bond with our children and give them the attention they need. In today's world, however, many parents are struggling to find time for their kids due to work, technology, and other distractions.</p>
  <p>That's where playful parenting comes in. By incorporating play into our daily routines, we can strengthen our bond with our children, help them learn new skills, and provide an outlet for their creativity and imagination.</p>
  <p>But how can we promote playful parenting when we're unable to be physically present with our children, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic? As many families are now relying on remote modalities to stay in touch, the challenges of promoting playful parenting are even greater.</p>
