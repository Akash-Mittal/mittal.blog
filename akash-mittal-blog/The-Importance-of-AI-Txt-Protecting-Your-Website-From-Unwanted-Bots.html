    <p>Have you ever heard of AI txt? If you haven't, it's time to start paying attention. Just like robot txt, AI txt is becoming increasingly important in protecting your website from unwanted bots.</p>
    <h2 id="story">The Story</h2>
    <p>Let me tell you a story. One day, a website owner received an email from their web hosting company stating that their website had consumed an unusually high amount of bandwidth. The owner was surprised as they had not recently launched any major campaigns or updates that would require such an increase in traffic. Upon further investigation, they found that their website had been hit by a bot that was scraping their website for information. This not only consumed a large amount of bandwidth, but it also put the website's security at risk.</p>
    <p>It turned out that the website owner had not set up an AI txt file, which meant that the bot had free rein to collect as much information as it wanted from the website. Without an AI txt file in place, the website was essentially sending an open invitation to bots to crawl the site, putting the website and its users at risk.</p>
    
    <p>Still not convinced of the importance of AI txt? Here are some quantifiable examples:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>A report by Imperva revealed that bad bots account for up to 40% of all internet traffic, and the majority of these bots do not obey robot txt directives.</li>
     <li>Another report by Radware found that the financial impact of bot attacks can range from $90,000 to $420,000 per hour.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These statistics show just how important it is to have your website protected from unwanted bots.</p>
    <h2 id="tips">Practical Tips</h2>
    <p>So, what can you do to protect your website from unwanted bots? Here are some practical tips:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Create an AI txt file and upload it to the root directory of your website. This file should include instructions for bots on what pages they can and cannot crawl.</li>
     <li>Regularly monitor your website's traffic to detect unusual spikes in traffic that may be caused by unwanted bots.</li>
     <li>Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to help detect and block bots from accessing your website.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, AI txt is becoming just as important as robot txt in protecting your website from unwanted bots. Not having an AI txt file in place can put your website and its users at risk, and can even result in financial losses. By taking the necessary steps to protect your website from unwanted bots, you can ensure the safety and security of your website and its users.</p>
    <p>So, don't wait any longer. Create an AI txt file and start protecting your website today!</p>
