    <p>It was an ordinary day. I was using my smartphone to order groceries when I noticed an unusual prompt. The app had started suggesting items I hadn't even thought of buying. "Did you forget something?" it asked. I scrolled down to see that it had added a few extra items to my cart, items that it thought I might need based on my previous purchases and browsing history.</p>
    <p>At first, I was impressed by the app's foresight. But then it hit me: this was artificial intelligence at work. The app had studied my habits, preferences, and tendencies and analyzed them to predict what I might need next. It knew me better than I knew myself. That's when the fear set in.</p>
    <p>AI scares the bejesus out of me. And I'm not alone.</p>
    <h2> AI Gone Awry</h2>
    <p>It's one thing to worry about AI in the context of sci-fi movies like <i>The Terminator</i>, where robots take over the world and enslave humans. But it's another to see its real-world impacts.</p>
    <p>Let's look at some examples of how AI has gone awry in recent years:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>The Facebook algorithm scandal of 2018, where the platform's algorithm was used to target political propaganda during the US elections, resulting in the manipulation of millions of users.</li>
     <li>The Uber self-driving car accident of 2018, where an autonomous vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian. The accident raised questions about safety, regulation, and the ethics of self-driving technology.</li>
     <li>The Microsoft Tay experiment of 2016, where the company's AI chatbot was trained to communicate with humans through Twitter. Within hours of its launch, the bot began spewing out racist and sexist remarks, demonstrating how easily AI can absorb and amplify negative human biases.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Magnetic Title</h2>
    <p>There's no denying that AI has incredible potential to make our lives better, easier, and more efficient. But we must acknowledge its risks and drawbacks, or we risk creating a future that is dystopian, not utopian.</p>
    <p>That's why we're calling attention to the scary side of AI. We want people to understand the implications of this technology and to make informed choices about how to use it.</p>
    <p>Our title, "Why AI Scares The Bejesus Out Of Me," reflects our mission. It's provocative, memorable, and attention-grabbing. We want people to read our article and share it with others, so that we can start a conversation about AI that's both honest and informed.</p>
    <h2></h2>
    <ol>
     <li>AI is not inherently evil, but it is powerful, complex, and potentially dangerous.</li>
     <li>We need to approach AI with caution, skepticism, and critical thinking, and we need to prioritize transparency, accountability, and ethical considerations in its development and deployment.</li>
     <li>We can't ignore the risks and drawbacks of AI for the sake of progress or convenience. We must be aware of its potential impacts on individuals, societies, and the environment, and we must work together to build a future that is both advanced and humane.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2> and Practical Tips</h2>
    <p>As a tech journalist, I've seen firsthand the ways in which AI is changing our world, both for better and for worse. I've also spoken with experts in AI, ethics, and policy, who have shared their insights and solutions to the challenges we face.</p>
    <p>Here are some practical tips that I've picked up along the way:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Take a critical and informed approach to AI. Don't blindly accept the claims and promises of AI developers and marketers. Ask questions, do research, and seek out diverse perspectives.</li>
     <li>Hold AI accountable for its impacts. Encourage transparency, regulation, and oversight of AI technologies and applications, and advocate for policies that promote social and environmental justice.</li>
     <li>Be proactive in shaping the future of AI. Get involved in AI initiatives and communities, and contribute to the development of AI tools and services that reflect our values and priorities as a society.</li>
    </ul>
