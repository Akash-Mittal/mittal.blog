     <p>One student, Alex, came to UNE with a dream of becoming a nurse. However, she struggled with the science courses that were required for her major. Alex reached out to her academic advisor for help and was directed to the Student Success Center.</p>
     <p>At the Student Success Center, Alex was matched with a peer tutor who was also a nursing major. The two worked together regularly, developing study strategies and reviewing material until Alex felt confident enough to take her exams. Thanks to the assistance of her tutor, Alex was able to succeed in her courses and graduate with honors.</p>
