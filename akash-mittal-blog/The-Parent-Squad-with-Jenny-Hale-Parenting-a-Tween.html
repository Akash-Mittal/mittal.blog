    <p>When my son turned 11, I thought I was prepared for whatever challenges parenting a tween would bring. I had read all the books, talked to the experts, and had a game plan in place. But no amount of preparation could have fully prepared me for the rollercoaster ride that is parenting a tween.</p>
    <p>One day everything is going smoothly, and the next it feels like you're walking on eggshells. It can be exhausting and frustrating. But it can also be incredibly rewarding. Watching your child grow into their own person, with their own thoughts and opinions, is a beautiful thing to witness.</p>
    
    <p>One of the biggest challenges of parenting a tween is dealing with their mood swings. One minute they're singing and dancing, and the next they're slamming doors and crying. According to a survey by Common Sense Media, 78% of parents say that managing their child's emotions is the most challenging part of parenting a tween.</p>
    <p>Another challenge is screen time. According to a study by Pew Research Center, 95% of teens have access to a smartphone, and 45% say they are online almost constantly. That's a lot of screen time, and it can be tough for parents to know how to regulate it.</p>
    <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
    <p>So how can parents navigate these challenges? Here are three practical tips:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Stay Calm: When your tween is having a meltdown, it can be easy to get swept up in their emotions. But staying calm can help deescalate the situation. Take a deep breath, validate their feelings, and try to talk through the issue.</li>
     <li>Set Boundaries: Screen time can be a tough issue to navigate, but setting clear boundaries can help. Decide on a reasonable amount of screen time for your child, and stick to it. You can also use apps and parental controls to help manage their access to technology.</li>
     <li>Stay Connected: One of the best things you can do as a parent of a tween is stay connected to them. Take an interest in their hobbies, ask them about their day, and carve out quality time together. This can help strengthen your relationship and build trust.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>When my son turned 12, he suddenly wanted nothing to do with me. He would barely speak to me, and when he did, it was with attitude. I tried everything to connect with him - playing video games, watching his favorite shows - but nothing seemed to work. It was hard not to feel rejected and hurt.</p>
    <p>But one day, I decided to take him out for ice cream. We sat down together, and I asked him how he was doing. To my surprise, he opened up to me about some of the things he'd been dealing with at school. It was a small moment, but it meant the world to me. It reminded me that even when our tweens seem distant, they still need us.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, parenting a tween can be a wild ride. But with patience, empathy, and a willingness to listen, it can also be incredibly rewarding. Remember to stay calm, set boundaries, and stay connected with your child. And above all, remember that you're not alone.</p>
