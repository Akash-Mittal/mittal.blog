    <h2>A Surprising Start</h2>
    <p>In 1993, Jen-Hsun Huang co-founded Nvidia with two other colleagues. At the time, the company focused on producing graphic processing units (GPUs) for the gaming industry. Huang had a bold vision: that GPUs could also be used for general computing, particularly for artificial intelligence (AI). This idea was ahead of its time and went against the conventional wisdom of chip makers at the time.</p>
    <p>Fast forward to 2021, and Huang's vision has become a reality. Nvidia is now a trillion-dollar company thanks to the AI boom.</p>

    <h2>The Power of AI</h2>
    <p>AI is transforming almost every industry, from healthcare to finance to transportation. And Nvidia is at the forefront of this revolution. The company's GPUs are used to power AI applications, including self-driving cars, medical imaging, and natural language processing.</p>
    <p>One example of Nvidia's impact on AI is its collaboration with Mercedes-Benz. Together, they developed an AI-powered car that can drive itself in complex urban environments. The car, called the Mercedes-Benz AVTR, uses Nvidia's GPUs to process massive amounts of data from sensors and cameras in real time. This allows the car to make split-second decisions, such as when to brake or accelerate, to avoid accidents.</p>
    <p>Another example is Nvidia's work with medical imaging. By using AI and GPUs, healthcare professionals can detect diseases earlier and with greater accuracy. This is especially important for conditions like cancer, where early detection can make a significant difference in a patient's prognosis.</p>

    <h2>The Numbers Speak for Themselves</h2>
    <p>Nvidia's success is not just anecdotal. The numbers show just how valuable the company has become:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Nvidia's stock price has increased more than 20-fold since 2015</li>
     <li>The company's revenue for the fiscal year 2021 was $16.7 billion</li>
     <li>Nvidia's market capitalization is over $400 billion</li>
     <li>The company has over 20,000 employees worldwide</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, Nvidia's success is a testament to the power of AI and the vision of its co-founder, Jen-Hsun Huang. The company's GPUs are transforming industries and creating new opportunities for innovation.</p>
    <p>Here are three key takeaways from Nvidia's rise:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Don't be afraid to go against conventional wisdom. Huang's belief that GPUs could be used for more than just gaming was ahead of its time, but he pursued it anyway and changed the industry.</li>
     <li>Invest in the future. Nvidia's focus on AI may not have paid off immediately, but the company's long-term vision has paid off in spades.</li>
     <li>Innovate with purpose. Nvidia's work with industries like healthcare and transportation is helping to solve real-world problems and make the world a better place.</li>
    </ol>
