   <p>Once upon a time, there was a pilot named Rahul who had been working with Air India for nearly a decade. He loved his job and was proud to be a part of the national flag carrier. However, his happiness turned into dismay when he came to know about the HR policies of the airline that were deemed unethical and draconian by pilot bodies.</p>
   <p>The policies included a bond period of 5-10 years, non-payment of dues to those who resigned during the bond period, forced leave without pay, etc. These policies were criticized by pilots and other airline professionals for being regressive and against the principles of natural justice.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, Rahul's story is not unique. Many other pilots have faced similar hardships due to Air India's HR policies. Despite repeated requests and protests by pilot bodies, the airline management has not shown any willingness to review or modify these policies.</p>
   <h2>Concrete Examples</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>In 2015, 47 pilots resigned due to these policies and refused to serve the bond period. However, Air India refused to pay their dues worth Rs.200 crore and initiated legal action against them.</li>
    <li>In 2016, Air India issued a circular mandating all its pilots to take a leave without pay for at least five days every month.</li>
    <li>In 2019, Air India grounded seven pilots for five days without pay for protesting against these policies.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Air India's HR policies have been criticized by pilot bodies for being draconian and unethical.</li>
    <li>These policies have resulted in hardships for pilots and other airline professionals.</li>
    <li>The airline management has shown no willingness to modify or review these policies, despite repeated protests.</li>
   </ol>
