  <p>Once upon a time, search engine optimization (SEO) was a fairly straightforward process. You would optimize your website content with keywords, meta tags, and backlinks and voila, you would rank on top of search engine results pages (SERPs).</p>
  <p>However, with the ever-increasing penetration of AI and machine learning in various industries, things are changing, and so is SEO. AI has the ability to learn from vast amounts of data, which means it can quickly adapt and improve search algorithms, leading to an entirely new approach to SEO.</p>
  <h2>Quantifiable examples</h2>
  <p>One major impact of AI on SEO is the increasing use of voice search. According to Google, 20% of searches on any mobile device are conducted with voice commands. As AI assistants like Siri and Alexa become more ubiquitous, this figure is expected to rise even more. This means that SEO professionals need to optimize their content to include conversational language and natural sentence structures.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, AI-based algorithms have become smarter and more discerning in interpreting user intent. Google's RankBrain algorithm is one such example that can now analyze search queries' context and semantic meaning to produce more accurate and relevant results.</p>
