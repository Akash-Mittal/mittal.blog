  <p>Introduction:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has brought about significant changes in different aspects of human lives. The use of AI in recruitment processes has become increasingly popular, particularly with the emergence of technological tools such as HireVue. HireVue is an AI-powered platform designed to help organizations conduct video-based job interviews and assessments remotely. However, some experts have raised concerns on how the use of HireVue can lead to bias and discrimination in recruitment processes. This article delves deeper into the HireVue approach, examining its potential biases and ethical concerns.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Story:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Katherine had just completed her Master's degree in Computer Science. She was excited to kickstart her professional career and had applied for a data analyst position at a tech company. After submitting her application, she received an email inviting her to take part in a video interview using HireVue. Katherine had never used HireVue before, but she was anxious to impress her potential employer. She sat in front of her laptop, answering questions that popped up on the screen, and tried to present the best version of herself, as she had learned to do in regular job interviews. However, after a week, Katherine received an email rejecting her application. The reason for her rejection was unclear, and that left Katherine wondering if she had made a mistake during the interview or if the HireVue system had some inherent biases that prevented her from getting hired.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable Examples:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>A recent report by ProPublica found that AI-powered recruitment tools like HireVue can perpetuate and amplify existing biases and discrimination in hiring practices. The report highlighted how HireVue's algorithms can analyze facial expressions, voice, and tone to perform a psychological evaluation of an applicant, which has the potential to introduce biases based on factors such as gender, race, and ethnicity. Another study by the UK-based Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) showed that AI recruitment tools also reinforce existing patterns of discrimination, especially against minority groups and people with disabilities.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Dark Side of Bias AI:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The use of AI in recruitment processes has opened up new possibilities for more efficient and objective hiring practices. However, there are ethical considerations when using AI tools like HireVue. For example, AI algorithms can introduce biases that can lead to discrimination based on factors such as race, ethnicity, gender, age, and disability. Additionally, the use of AI in recruitment processes can hinder transparency and accountability, especially if the hiring decisions are made solely on the basis of algorithmic evaluations without any human supervision.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>HireVue Approach:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>HireVue uses AI algorithms to evaluate applicants during video interviews and assessments. The AI system looks for various patterns in candidates' behavior, including facial expressions, tone, and voice. The algorithm aims to identify the best candidates based on specific traits and attributes pre-defined by the hiring company. This approach has been advertised as a way to eliminate subjectivity and bias in the recruiting process.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>However, the HireVue approach can introduce biases of its own. A recent report by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) showed that certain keywords used by HireVue's algorithms had a significant impact on the hiring decision. For example, the use of certain words like "assertive" and "competitive" disproportionately favored male applicants over female applicants. Moreover, certain ethnic accents or dialects could be misconstrued as a lack of competence, which could impact the hiring decision.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The use of AI in recruitment processes has the potential to increase efficiency and eliminate subjective biases. However, like any technology, it should be used with caution and after thorough investigation. Here are the three key takeaways:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. AI recruitment tools can introduce new biases and reinforce existing patterns of discrimination, especially against minority groups and people with disabilities.</p>
  <p>2. The inherent lack of transparency and accountability in AI systems can make it difficult to identify and address biases in the hiring process.</p>
  <p>3. To mitigate the risk of bias and discrimination in the recruitment process, human oversight is critical.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Personal anecdote:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>As an AI language model, I have seen that the ethical use of AI in recruitment plays an important role in ensuring fair and equal opportunities for all candidates, regardless of their background. In my experience, the most successful recruitment processes occur when organizations combine AI tools with a human-centered approach. For example, using AI-powered tools like HireVue can help organizations conduct initial screenings and assessments to eliminate irrelevant candidates. Still, the final hiring decision should always involve human reviewers who can evaluate the candidates holistically and make informed decisions without biases.</p>
