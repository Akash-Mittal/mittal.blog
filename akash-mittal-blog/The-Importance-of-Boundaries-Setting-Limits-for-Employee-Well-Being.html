    <p>At the beginning of her career, Maria was proud to be a dedicated employee who was always available to help her colleagues. She would answer emails and take calls late into the night, even on weekends. She believed that this was the best way to show her commitment to the company and her team. However, after a few months, she started to feel burnt out and overwhelmed. She was constantly tired and stressed, and her personal life was suffering.</p>
    <p>Maria's situation is not uncommon. Many employees, especially those who are new to the workforce, feel pressure to always be available and to go above and beyond their job descriptions. However, this can have serious consequences for their well-being and productivity.</p>
    <h3>Why Boundaries and Limits are Important</h3>
    <p>Boundaries and limits are guidelines that help individuals maintain their physical, emotional, and mental health. Without boundaries, people can become overwhelmed, exhausted, and resentful. This applies not only to personal relationships but also to work relationships.</p>
    <p>Setting boundaries and limits is especially important in the workplace, where employees are expected to manage their time and energy effectively to meet their job requirements. It is essential for employees to learn how to say no when they are overextended or when a request is outside of their job description. Setting boundaries also allows employees to maintain a healthy work-life balance, which can reduce stress and increase job satisfaction.</p>
    <h3>Examples of Quantifiable Benefits</h3>
    <p>Research has shown that setting boundaries and limits can have a positive impact on employee well-being and productivity. Here are some examples:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>A study by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health found that employees who felt they had control over their work schedules experienced less stress and had better physical and mental health.</li>
     <li>In a survey by the Society for Human Resource Management, 89% of human resource professionals reported that flexible work arrangements positively impacted employee retention and job satisfaction.</li>
     <li>A study by the Association for Psychological Science found that taking regular breaks throughout the workday can increase productivity and focus.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Practical Tips for Setting Boundaries and Limits</h3>
