    <h2>An interesting story to start</h2>
    <p>Comedian Bert Kreischer recently declared Oreos to be an essential part of parenting in a YouTube video that went viral. In the video, Kreischer recounts a time when his daughter was having a meltdown and nothing seemed to calm her down. Desperate for a solution, he offered her an Oreo and just like that, she was suddenly happy and content. Kreischer goes on to explain that Oreos have become a go-to tool for him as a parent, something he never thought he would rely on but has found to be incredibly effective.</p>
    <h2>Quantifiable examples</h2>
    <p>Kreischer isn't alone in his belief that Oreos are an essential part of parenting. A quick search on social media platforms like Instagram and Twitter reveals countless parents sharing stories of how Oreos have saved the day. Some examples include:</p>

     <li>A dad who uses Oreos as a bribe to get his kids to do their homework</li>
     <li>A parent who uses Oreos to distract their kids during long car rides</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are just a few examples, but they illustrate just how versatile Oreos can be when it comes to parenting. The cookies can be used as incentives, distractions, rewards, and so much more.</p>
    
    <p>Kreischer also shares some personal anecdotes about his own use of Oreos as a parenting tool. For example, he often uses them as a way to bribe his daughters into taking pictures with him, something they're not always eager to do.
