    <p>Kim Kardashian, the reality TV star and businesswoman, has received backlash over parenting complaints in her newly launched podcast. Kardashian, who has four children, has been criticised for her parenting methods and has been accused of showing a lack of sensitivity towards her children's emotions.</p>
    <p>Listeners of the podcast voiced their concerns over Kardashian's comments regarding her six-year-old daughter's desire to wear make-up. Kardashian reportedly laughed off the request in the podcast, saying that her daughter loves make-up and it's what she's passionate about. She also defended her decision to share provocative photos on social media, saying that it's her body and she can do what she wants with it.</p>
    <p>This is not the first time Kardashian has come under fire for her parenting decisions. In 2018, she faced criticism for allowing her then-two-year-old daughter to wear giant hoop earrings. Critics accused her of sexualising her child and setting a bad example. Kardashian defended her decision, saying that her daughter is just a baby and doesn't know what people are saying about her earrings.</p>
    
    <p>The criticism of Kardashian's parenting decisions highlights the ongoing debate about what is considered appropriate behaviour when it comes to children. A recent survey conducted by the parenting website Netmums found that over 60% of parents have been criticised by others for their parenting style. Of these, 20% said that criticism had come from family members and another 20% from strangers. The survey also found that parents are most likely to be criticised for allowing their child to have too much screen time, not disciplining their child enough, and for being overprotective.</p>
    <p>It's clear that parenting decisions can be a contentious issue and everyone has their own opinion. However, it's important for parents to remember that they know their children best and should make decisions based on their individual needs.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, Kim Kardashian's parenting complaints have sparked controversy and debate in the media. However, it's important for parents to remember that they are the best judge of their children's needs and should make decisions accordingly. Parents should also remember that criticism comes with the territory and they should not be too quick to take it to heart. With the right support and guidance, parents can make informed decisions that are in the best interests of their children.</p>
