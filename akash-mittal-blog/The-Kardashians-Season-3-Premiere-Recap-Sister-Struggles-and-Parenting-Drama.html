    <p>It's another season of The Kardashians, and the drama is already at an all-time high. The sisters are struggling to maintain their relationships, while also dealing with parenting challenges.</p>
    <p>In the season premiere, Khloe and Kourtney are at odds over their kids' birthday parties. Khloe wants to go all out for her daughter True's first birthday, while Kourtney wants a more low-key celebration for her sons Mason and Reign.</p>
    <p>The tension between the sisters escalates when Khloe accuses Kourtney of not being a supportive sister. Kourtney fires back, saying that Khloe has a habit of being too controlling. The argument ends with Khloe storming out of the room.</p>
    <p>This is just one example of the sister struggles that have been a constant theme throughout the season. Kim is also dealing with her own relationship issues with her husband Kanye, which is putting a strain on her relationship with her sisters.</p>
    <p>But it's not all drama and fights. The season also shows the sisters coming together to support each other in tough times. When Kim's daughter North has a health scare, her sisters rally around her to make sure she's okay.</p>
    <p>The season finale is an emotional one, as the family comes together to celebrate Kourtney's 40th birthday. Despite their previous conflicts, the sisters put their differences aside and bond over their love for each other and their family.</p>
    
    <p>Throughout the season, the sisters tackle a number of parenting challenges. From sleepless nights to discipline issues, they open up about the struggles of raising kids in the public eye. Kim admits that she sometimes feels guilty for being a working mom, while Kourtney struggles with finding a balance between being a mom and her work on her lifestyle brand, Poosh.</p>
    <p>The season also showcases the extravagant lifestyle of the Kardashians. From the over-the-top parties to the designer clothes, it's clear that money is not a concern for this family. However, it's also clear that their wealth comes with its own set of challenges, such as maintaining their image and dealing with constant media scrutiny.</p>
