  <h1>The Economic Fallout of Russia-Ukraine Conflict on Pakistan</h1> <img src="images/The-Economic-Fallout-of-Russia-Ukraine-Conflict-on-Pakistan.jpeg" alt="+The-Economic-Fallout-of-Russia-Ukraine-Conflict-on-Pakistan+">
  <p>Once upon a time, there was a small but growing Pakistani business that had just secured a customer in Ukraine. Everything was going smoothly until the conflict between Russia and Ukraine erupted and the Pakistani business suddenly found itself at risk of losing the customer due to the economic fallout of the conflict. This story is just one small example of the impact that the conflict in Eastern Europe has had on Pakistan.</p>
  
  <p>The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has had a number of quantifiable impacts on Pakistan, including:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Decreased exports - Pakistan's exports to Ukraine have decreased by 66% since 2013, largely due to the economic impact of the conflict.</li>
   <li>Decreased remittances - Around 60% of Pakistanis working in Ukraine have returned home due to the conflict, resulting in a significant decrease in remittances from that country.</li>
   <li>Increased energy costs - Pakistan has had to look to other countries for energy imports, which has led to increased costs for businesses and consumers.</li>
  </ul>

  </ol>
  <h2> and Practical Tips</h2>
  <p>One Pakistani business owner, who previously exported goods to Ukraine, has had to completely shift his focus to other markets in order to stay afloat. He recommends that other Pakistani businesses do the same, as relying on the Ukrainian market is no longer a reliable option.</p>
  <p>Another Pakistani citizen, who worked in Ukraine for several years before returning home due to the conflict, has had to find alternate sources of income since his remittances have decreased significantly. He advises other workers to be cautious about seeking employment in countries that are currently experiencing conflict or instability.</p>
