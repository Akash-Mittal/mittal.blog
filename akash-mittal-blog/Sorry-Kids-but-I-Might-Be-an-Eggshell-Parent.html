  <p></p>
  <p>It was a classic case of "first-time jitters" when I brought my bundle of joy home. I don't think I slept a wink that first night, constantly checking on my newborn to ensure their safety. As the days turned into weeks, my anxiety only grew. I found myself constantly worrying about everything from what my baby was eating to what toys they were playing with.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Fast forward ten years, and I'm still the same anxious parent. Except now, my child is a tween, and I've come to realize that this parenting style has a name- "eggshell parent". An eggshell parent is one who is overly protective and shields their child from any potential harm, making sure they do not get their feelings hurt or face any form of failure.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>As I dug deeper into my parenting style, I discovered that I'm not alone. And it's no surprise, with the rise of social media and the constant stream of information, it's easy to feel the pressure to be the perfect parent. But being an eggshell parent can have some damaging consequences for both the parent and child.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Here are my top three reasons why I need to break out of my eggshell-parenting style.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Lack of Resilience and Self-Confidence in Children</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>By shielding children from any form of failure, we inhibit their ability to build resilience and self-confidence. It's important to remember that failure is a part of life and a crucial element in character building. The more we protect them, the more we undermine their ability to learn from their mistakes and grow.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>For example, if my child gets a low score on a test, my first instinct as an eggshell parent is to "protect" them from the disappointment of poor grades. However, this only teaches my child that there is no value in effort, and it's okay to give up on something they're not good at. By allowing them to experience the low score and encouraging them to try harder next time, they learn that failure is not the end of the road but rather a stepping stone towards success.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Over-Dependency on Parental Guidance</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Eggshell parenting creates a situation where the child is overly dependent on parental guidance, leaving them ill-equipped to make decisions for themselves. Shielding them from making choices on their own inhibits their capacity to develop autonomy and self-reliance.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>An excellent case in point is how I handle my child's school projects. I often get overly involved in every aspect of the project, from choosing the topics to helping them create the final output. Even though I think I am doing this to help them, this approach cripples my child's capacity to think critically and creatively. Empowering them to make decisions on their own shows that we trust their judgment, and this can help build their self-esteem.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. It's Not a Sustainable Parenting Style</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Let's face it, being an eggshell parent is not a sustainable parenting style. It's mentally and emotionally exhausting, and eventually, the pressure will take a toll on our wellbeing. That's why it's important to find a balance between being nurturing and supportive while allowing our children to experience life's ups and downs.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>To move away from eggshell parenting, we can start by letting our children face small challenges and be okay with the possibility of failure. We can also encourage them to be independent and make decisions for themselves. With time, they will learn how to navigate life's challenges, building resilience and independence along the way.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, I need to break out of my eggshell-parenting cocoon and embrace a more balanced approach to parenting. I now realize that I am not protecting my child as much as I am holding them back. By encouraging my child to take risks, fail, and learn from their mistakes, I build their resilience and self-confidence, helping them become successful adults.</p>
