   <p>Former Nickelodeon star, Drake Bell, has taken to social media to warn his fans of the death threats he's been receiving after being accused of 'paedo' abuse.</p>
   <div class="quote">
    <p>"I will not allow these disgusting allegations to take over my life and to continue to be spewed on my name with no basis, facts or evidence."</p>
    <p>- Drake Bell's statement on Twitter</p>
   </div>
   <p>Bell, who rose to fame on the hit TV show "Drake &amp; Josh" has been accused of grooming and sexually abusing a minor. While he denies these claims, web trolls have been attacking him relentlessly on social media, threatening his life.</p>
   <p>This is not the first time Bell has faced allegations of this nature. In 2018, he pleaded guilty to attempted child endangerment and was sentenced to two years probation.</p>
   <p>While it's important to take allegations of abuse seriously, it's equally important to remember that people are innocent until proven guilty. Bell's case is still under investigation and until there is concrete evidence to support the accusations, it's unfair to jump to conclusions.</p>
   <div class="conclusion">
    <h3>In conclusion, here are three important points to remember:</h3>
    <ul>
     <li>Drake Bell has been accused of 'paedo' abuse but denies the claims.</li>
     <li>Web trolls have been threatening him with death, which is unacceptable.</li>
     <li>Like all individuals accused of a crime, Bell is innocent until proven guilty.</li>
    </ul>
