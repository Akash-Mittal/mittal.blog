   <p>Imagine this: you're chatting with a friend on a social media platform when suddenly a stranger joins the conversation. They start talking about something that interests you and slowly they start gathering information. This is just one example of how threat actors can use ChatGPT, an AI language model, as a tool for their attacks.</p>
   <p>Here are 5 real-life examples of how companies have been affected by such attacks:</p>
   <ol>

They used ChatGPT to generate fake emails and chat messages to access Reddit's employee accounts.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/twitter-hack-bitcoin-scam-may-have-been-an-inside-job-bbc-report-120072400193_1.html">Twitter</a>: In July 2020, hackers targeted several high-profile Twitter accounts, including those of Elon Musk and Barack Obama. They used ChatGPT to impersonate the account holders and convince followers to send them Bitcoin.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3624342/how-cyber-criminals-use-slack-to-break-into-companies.html">Slack</a>: In 2021, hackers started using Slack channels to communicate with each other and share information. They also used ChatGPT to create fake identities and infiltrate companies through their Slack channels.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/cyber-criminals-hack-github-to-host-a-2nd-stage-malware-attack/#:~:text=">GitHub</a>: In 2020, a group of hackers used a vulnerability in GitHub's Actions feature to upload malware to victim's systems. They also used ChatGPT to generate fake messages to maintain their access to the compromised machines.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-uses-gpt-3-to-generate-credible-phishing-emails/">Phishing Attacks</a>: In 2021, a security researcher used ChatGPT to generate convincing phishing emails that targeted his clients.

   </ol>
   <p>These examples are just a few of the many ways that hackers can use ChatGPT to their advantage. As AI language models become more advanced, the threat of such attacks will only increase. It's important for companies to be aware of these threats and to take steps to protect themselves.</p>
