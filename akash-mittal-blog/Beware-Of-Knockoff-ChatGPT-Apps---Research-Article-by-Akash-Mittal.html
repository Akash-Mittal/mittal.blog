   <p>When I first heard about ChatGPT, I was thrilled because it seemed like a great tool to communicate with my friends and colleagues. However, when I started using it, I quickly realized that there were many knockoff ChatGPT apps out there that were not only unsafe but also untrustworthy.</p>
   <p>Real life examples of such scams include a knockoff ChatGPT app called â??ChatGPTx,â?? which tricked users into sending money in order to unlock premium features. Another app called â??ChatGPT+â?? lured users into filling out personal information, which was later used for identity theft.</p>
   <p>The sad reality is that these knockoff ChatGPT apps are becoming more and more common. Users should always be cautious and understand the risks associated when they download apps from unknown sources.</p>
   <p>One of the main companies behind ChatGPT, Creative Technology Ltd., has been actively involved in tackling these imposters. They have issued statements warning users of these fake apps and have taken legal action against them.</p>
   <h3>Recommended Actions:</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>Only download apps from trusted sources such as Google Play Store or Apple App Store.</li>
    <li>Always make sure to read the reviews before downloading any app.</li>
    <li>Be wary of any app that asks for excessive permissions or personal information.</li>
   </ol>
