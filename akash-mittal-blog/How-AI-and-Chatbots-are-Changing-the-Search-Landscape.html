  <h1>A Trip to the Mall</h1> <img src="images/How-AI-and-Chatbots-are-Changing-the-Search-Landscape.jpeg" alt="+How-AI-and-Chatbots-are-Changing-the-Search-Landscape+">
  <p>It was a typical Saturday afternoon and I decided to head to the mall to do some shopping. As I walked in, I was greeted by a friendly chatbot on a digital kiosk that asked me if I needed any help finding anything. I chuckled and thought to myself, "This is interesting!".</p>
  <p>After browsing for a bit, I headed to a clothing store and was greeted by a sales associate who asked me what I was looking for. I responded by saying I needed a dress for a wedding. The sales associate then asked me follow-up questions to better understand my style preferences and what I needed the dress for.</p>
  <p>As she went to look for dresses to show me, I glanced over to see her using a tablet with a chatbot-like interface to help her find what I was looking for. She quickly found a couple of options and showed them to me. I tried them on, made my purchase and left the store impressed by the personalized and efficient customer service.</p><!-- End of Interesting Story --> <!-- Start of Quantifiable Examples -->
