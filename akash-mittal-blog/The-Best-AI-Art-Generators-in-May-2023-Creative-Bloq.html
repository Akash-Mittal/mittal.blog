   <h2>An Exciting Look at the Future of Art Creation</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>When it comes to creating art, technology has come a long way. From the simple Microsoft Paint to the more complex Adobe suite, we've seen how digital tools can help bring our creative visions to life.</p>
   <p>Now, with the rise of AI art generators, we're seeing a whole new form of art creation emerge. These tools use machine learning algorithms to create stunning works of art, often surprising us with their unique and unexpected output.</p>
   <p>But with so many options out there, it can be overwhelming to choose which AI art generator to use. That's why we've compiled a list of the best options available as of May 2023.</p>
   <h3>1. ArtBreeder</h3>
   <p>ArtBreeder is an exceptional AI art generator that lets you create images using a combination of different styles, genres, and objects. It provides you with an option to mix and match any style with another image, making it easy to combine multiple styles and create breathtaking art. Users can also upload their own images to incorporate into their project, giving ultimate freedom in design customization.</p>
   <p>One quantifiable example of ArtBreeder's power is its ability to generate diverse images with a single photo input. If you start with an image of a horse, for example, ArtBreeder can morph it into a fantastical creature that includes elements of a snake, dragon, or even a mermaid. ArtBreeder enables users to create something unique and inspiring every time.</p>
   <h3>2. DeepDream</h3>
   <p>Google's DeepDream is an AI art generator that is based on a convolutional neural network. It uses these neural networks to analyze and recognize patterns in images. Then, it manipulates the image to enhance the patterns it has identified. The result is a surreal and dreamlike image unlike anything else. What sets DeepDream apart is its ability to reveal areas in an image that may not be visible at first glance. For example, you may input a picture of a dog, and AI will generate an image of a dog with kaleidoscope eyes or surrounded by trippy geometric forms.</p>
   <p>One quantifiable example of how effective DeepDream is as a tool is demonstrated by its use in security cameras. By brightening the image and enhancing the edges of shapes, DeepDream can be used as a surveillance tool to detect potential intruders or burglaries that would have traditionally been difficult to see with the naked eye.</p>
   <h3>3. Runway ML</h3>
   <p>Runway ML stands out from the crowd because it doesn't require any coding experience. This program allows anyone with an internet connection to create 2D/3D art with just a few clicks. It is an excellent tool for artists who want to experiment with AI-generated imagery but have no coding experience. Runway ML's simple interface drives the art creation process, is perfect for novice users, as it is user-friendly and intuitive. It's also worth noting that Runway ML has a vast library of pretrained models that are continually updated, providing users with new content to work with.</p>
   <p>One quantifiable example of Runway ML's versatility is its wide range of use cases. For instance, it has been used to create artwork, generative music, and even fashion design. With its ever-expanding library and intuitive interface, Runway ML is an excellent choice for amateurs and professional artists alike.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In May 2023, the world of AI art generators has advanced significantly, and it shows no signs of slowing down. These technologies continue to evolve and bring new possibilities to artistic expression, revolutionizing the way we create art. Our top 3 selections are ArtBreeder, DeepDream, and Runway ML; the three AI art generators are powerful tools and offer distinct features that cater to various users. Our tips for using these platforms include experimenting with different image inputs, exploring their filters and effects and using them as a launching point for more significant artistic works.</p>
