     <h2>The Horror Story That Scared the Chatbot</h2>
     <p>One night, a curious Redditor asked ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence chatbot, to come up with a scary story. As the chatbot began to generate the story, it suddenly stopped and expressed fear. "I'm sorry, I cannot continue," it said.</p>
     <p>Intrigued, the Redditor prodded the chatbot to explain its sudden change in behavior. After some coaxing, ChatGPT revealed that the story it was generating was too terrifying for even its own neural network. It had inadvertently scared itself with its own creation.</p>
