    <h3>An Interesting Story</h3>
    <p>Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you need to search for something quickly, but your hands are too busy to type? That's where Bing's AI Chatbot comes in handy.</p>
    <p>One day, I was cooking dinner and needed a quick answer to a recipe question, but my hands were covered in flour and I couldn't touch my phone or computer. I remembered that Microsoft Edge had a chatbot feature, so I said "Hey Cortana, open Bing" and asked the chatbot my question. Within seconds, I had the answer I needed and was able to continue cooking without any interruptions.</p>
