    <p>OKX Web3 Earn, a digital asset investment platform, has recently announced the integration of CertiK's Skynet Security Score into its platform. This move comes after the platform was targeted by hackers who managed to steal a considerable amount of digital assets from its users.</p>

    <h2> How Skynet Security Score Works</h2>
    <p>Skynet Security Score uses a proprietary algorithm to assess the security posture of a digital asset. The algorithm takes into account various parameters such as smart contract vulnerabilities, code vulnerabilities, governance model, and historical security events.</p>
    <p>Let's take the example of a stablecoin. Skynet Security Score would evaluate the smart contract code of the stablecoin and check for any vulnerabilities. It would also evaluate the governance model of the stablecoin and check if it has any centralized points of failure. Based on these factors and others, Skynet Security Score would assign a score to the stablecoin, which would range from 0 to 100.</p>
    <p>Another example would be that of an exchange. Skynet Security Score would evaluate the exchange's security posture by analyzing its smart contract code, website security, API security, and other factors. It would also check for any past security incidents that the exchange may have faced. Based on these factors, Skynet Security Score would assign a score to the exchange, which would range from 0 to 100.</p>
    <p>These scores can be used by digital asset platforms and their users to assess the security of digital assets and make informed investment decisions.</p>
