    <p>My mother-in-law was never a great parent. She constantly put her own needs before those of her children, leaving them to fend for themselves. When I entered the picture as her daughter-in-law, her neglectful behavior began to affect me as well. I was constantly forced to pick up the slack and take care of her children because she couldn't be bothered to do so.</p>
    <p>As time went on, I realized that living in the wreckage of her crappy parenting was taking a toll on me. I was exhausted from constantly being on high-alert and taking care of those who couldn't take care of themselves. It wasn't until I took a step back and evaluated the situation that I realized things needed to change.</p>
