   <h2>Practical Tips for Using ChatGPT</h2>
   <p>If you're a college student who wants to give ChatGPT a try, here are some practical tips to help you get started:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Take advantage of the chatbot's 24/7 availability. You can access ChatGPT anytime, anywhere, which makes it a great tool for late-night study sessions or last-minute assignment help.</li>
    <li>Be specific when asking questions. The more information you provide to ChatGPT, the better it can help you. For example, instead of asking, "How do I solve this problem?" try asking, "Can you help me understand how to use the quadratic formula to solve this problem?"</li>
    <li>Don't rely solely on ChatGPT. While the chatbot can be incredibly helpful, it's important to also seek help from your professors or study with peers. ChatGPT should be seen as a supplement to other forms of academic support.</li>
