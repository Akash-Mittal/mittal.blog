    <h2>How It All Started...</h2>
    <p>Years ago, I was introduced to the world of video games by my older brother. He spent entire days playing "Super Mario Bros." and "The Legend of Zelda" on his Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). I was always jealous of his skills and the fact that he had unlimited coins. As I grew older, I found myself immersed in the world of gaming and discovered new worlds through the screen.</p>
    <p>Nowadays, video games have become a massive industry and the source of entertainment for millions of people worldwide. From the classic arcade games to the modern consoles, gaming has evolved into a cultural phenomenon. That's the reason ChatGPT has compiled a list of the top 10 video games of all time. This list consists of the games that have made the most impact on the industry and provided gamers with hours of entertainment.</p>
