    <h3>The Rise of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Web Development</h3>
    <p>As we enter the 21st century, the way we interact with the web is fundamentally changing. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are set to become key drivers in the development of the web over the next decade. One example of this is chatbots, which have seen a surge in popularity in recent years.</p>
    <p>Companies such as Nike and Bank of America now use chatbots to interact with customers online. These bots are powered by AI and are capable of responding to customer inquiries and even making recommendations. The use of chatbots is just one example of how AI and ML are transforming the web into a more interactive and personalized experience for users.</p>
    <h4>Quantifiable Example:</h4>
    <p>According to a recent study by Grand View Research, the global chatbot market is expected to reach $1.25 billion by 2025. This is due to the increasing demand for automated customer support and the need to reduce human error in customer service.</p>

    <h3>The Advent of Progressive Web Apps</h3>
    <p>Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web applications that work like native apps. They can be installed on a user's mobile device and offer a fast, responsive, and engaging user experience. PWAs are set to become the future of the web as they offer the perfect combination of the web and the native app experience.</p>
    <p>PWAs are fast, reliable, and provide users with push notifications, offline access, and the ability to add them to their home screens. Companies such as Twitter, Forbes, and Alibaba have already adopted PWAs and have seen increased user engagement and conversions.</p>
    <h4>Quantifiable Example:</h4>
    <p>A study by Google showed that PWAs can increase conversions by up to 52%. Alibaba saw a 76% increase in conversions after implementing a PWA, while Forbes saw a 100% increase in engagement and a 43% increase in sessions per user.</p>

    <h3>The Need for More Inclusive Website Design</h3>
    <p>The web is becoming more inclusive as designers and developers become more aware of the need for accessible websites. Accessibility is not only important for those with disabilities, but also for those with slow internet connections and for those using mobile devices.</p>
    <p>Websites that are designed with accessibility in mind are easier to use and provide a better user experience for everyone. This includes features such as text alternatives for non-text content, keyboard accessible navigation, and clear and consistent headings.</p>
    <h4>Quantifiable Example:</h4>
    <p>A study by WebAIM showed that 98.1% of the homepages of the top one million websites had detectable WCAG 2 failures. These failures included missing alternative text for images, missing form input labels, and low contrast text.</p>
