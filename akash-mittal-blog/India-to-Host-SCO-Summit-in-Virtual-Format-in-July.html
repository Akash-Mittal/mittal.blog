    <h2>What is the SCO?</h2>
    <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) is a Eurasian political, economic, and security alliance consisting of eight member states: China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, India, and Pakistan. Its main objectives are to promote cooperation in various fields, including political, economic, military, and humanitarian, while also dealing with terrorism, separatism, and extremism in the region.</p>
    <p>The SCO was established in 2001 and has since then become an influential forum for regional cooperation. Its members account for around 42% of the world's population, and 23% of global GDP, making it an essential part of the global economy.</p>
    <h2>Impact of the Summit</h2>
    <p>The SCO summit is crucial for India, especially during these uncertain times. As one of the newest members of the organization, India has a great opportunity to strengthen its relations with Russia, China, and other Central Asian countries. The summit provides India with a platform to showcase its economic, political, and cultural prowess and demonstrate its willingness to work towards regional and global security.</p>
    <p>The summit's virtual format comes at a time when most countries are adopting online platforms to conduct meetings and conferences. Virtual summits are becoming the new normal, and this trend is likely to continue, given the ongoing pandemic. The virtual format also increases accessibility, making the SCO summit more inclusive and able to engage with a more extensive range of people across the globe.</p>
