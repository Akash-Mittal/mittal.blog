  <p>In the fast-paced world of finance, where investors are constantly on the lookout for the best deals, a new player has emerged - ChatGPT. Founded in 2020, ChatGPT is a conversational AI platform that allows investors to automate their investments, receive financial advice, and gain insights into their portfolio. While still relatively unknown, the platform has been gaining traction, and some experts believe that it could pose a serious challenge to big fund managers in the near future.</p>

With the help of ChatGPT, Lisa's clients were able to maximize their returns and minimize their risks in a way that was impossible with traditional methods.</p>
