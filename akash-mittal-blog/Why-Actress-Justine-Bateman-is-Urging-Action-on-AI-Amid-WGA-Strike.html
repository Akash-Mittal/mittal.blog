   <h2>An Eye-opening Story of AI and Hollywood Industry</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>It was a busy day on the set of the popular sitcom, Family Ties, back in the 80s. Everyone was getting ready to shoot the last scene for the day when something strange happened. The main protagonist, Michael J. Fox, couldn't recollect his lines properly and kept messing up the scene. No matter how many retakes they did, the scene just wasn't working like it was supposed to.</p>
   <p>It turns out, Michael was actually having an off day, and his brain just wasn't functioning properly. The director and the writers didn't know what to do. They were all getting frustrated by the wasted time and none of them had a solution. That's when a young Justine Bateman, who played Michael's sister on the show, came up with an idea that changed the course of the shooting that day and possibly changed the future of the Hollywood industry.</p>
   <p>Justine suggested that they use a computer program that could analyze Michael's past performances and come up with his dialogue and mannerism on the spot. The rest of the crew was hesitant at first, but they had nothing to lose at that point. The AI program turned out to be a game-changer and they managed to complete the scene without any further problems. The director and the writers were so impressed by the technology that they put it to use on several occasions after that day.</p>
   <p>Fast forward to 2021, Justine Bateman has partnered with AI experts to develop a program similar to the one she suggested back in the day. She believes that AI can revolutionize the entertainment industry in a bigger way, beyond just helping actors on set. Bateman thinks AI could optimize the entire process of content creation, from casting to post-production.</p>
   <h3>Quantifiable Examples of AI in Entertainment Industry</h3>
   <p>AI has already started to make a massive impact on the entertainment industry in several ways. Here are some examples that illustrate the extent of AI's influence:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Netflix uses AI algorithms to personalize its recommendations to each user's viewing history.</li>
    <li>MGM uses AI to predict box office revenue for a movie before its release.</li>
    <li>Warner Bros. is using AI to analyze movie trailers and predict audience reactions before the release of the film.</li>
    <li>IBM Watson helped the team of “The Next Rembrandt” to create an AI human face that looked like a Rembrandt portrait.</li>
    <li>Walmart used AI to create scripts for commercials that performed better than ads created by humans in A/B testing.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Why the Current WGA Strike is Relevant to AI</h3>
   <p>Justine Bateman has been an active participant in the current WGA strike, which has been going on since Nov 2021. The Writers Guild of America is striking over their dispute with the big media conglomerates such as Disney and Warner Bros. regarding compensation and working conditions. Bateman believes that AI can play a significant role in resolving the issues that the WGA is protesting about.</p>
   <p>According to Bateman, AI can be used to democratize the content creation process by eliminating the need for studios to prioritize their wealth and reputation over the creative process. AI could be used to analyze the script, cast actors based on their acting abilities instead of their box office draw, and even help writers optimize their drafts for the audience's interests.</p>
