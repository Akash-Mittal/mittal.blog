  <p>However, a new browser called Arc is bringing back the MySpace-style customization to the web, and it's gaining traction among tech enthusiasts and social media users alike.</p><img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/12/09/17/24/smartphone-1087228_1280.jpg" alt="Arc Browser" width="800" height="533">
