  <p>Have you ever wished for a robot to do your house chores for you? Well, a Japan AI startup has just released a robot that can do just that!</p>
  <p>The startup, called RoboHouse, has spent the last two years developing a robot that can clean floors, do laundry, and even make meals. The robot, called RoboHome, is set to revolutionize the way we do housework.</p>
  
  <p>According to RoboHouse, the RoboHome can clean a room in half the time it would take a human to do so. It can also do laundry for a family of four in just one hour, and cook a meal in under 20 minutes.</p>
  <p>Based on these examples, it's clear to see how the RoboHome can save people a lot of time and effort when it comes to household chores.</p>
