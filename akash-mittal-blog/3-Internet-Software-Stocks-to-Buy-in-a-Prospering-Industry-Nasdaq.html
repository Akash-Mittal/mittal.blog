  <p>Have you ever heard of the saying "The early bird catches the worm"? Well, in the world of investing, it's definitely true. The earlier you invest in a prospering industry, the better chances you have of reaping the benefits.</p>
  <p>Technology is constantly evolving, and with that comes a thriving industry of internet software. As more and more businesses turn to online platforms, investing in internet software stocks can be a smart move. Here are three internet software stocks that are worth considering:</p>
  <h2>1. Microsoft</h2>
