   <p>Co-parenting with an ex-spouse can be challenging, but it doesn't have to be. With the right mindset and some practical tips, it is possible to maintain a healthy relationship with your ex for the sake of your children. Jennifer Garner and Sheryl Lee Ralph are two celebrity moms who have successfully navigated co-parenting with their exes. Here are some of their tips:</p>
   <h2>Tip #1: Put Your Children First</h2>
   <p>Both Jennifer Garner and Sheryl Lee Ralph agree that the most important thing in co-parenting is prioritizing your children's needs. This means putting aside any personal issues or negative feelings towards your ex and focusing on what is best for your kids. Jennifer has said, "You don't have a choice about whether or not your kids come first in your life. You do have a choice about how you explain that to them."</p>
   <p>Quantifiable Example: When Jennifer and her ex-husband, Ben Affleck, separated in 2015, they made a conscious effort to co-parent their three children, Violet, Seraphina, and Samuel. They even went on a family vacation together after their divorce was finalized, showing that it is possible to put your differences aside and prioritize your children's happiness.</p>
   <h2>Tip #2: Communicate Effectively</h2>
   <p>Effective communication is key to successful co-parenting. Sheryl Lee Ralph emphasizes the importance of being honest and open with your ex, while also being respectful. She says, "Listen to your ex, don't interrupt, don't be dismissive. Just because you're not together doesn't mean you can't be co-parents and talk about your child's welfare."</p>
   <p>Quantifiable Example: Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck have been known to attend therapy sessions together to work on their co-parenting relationship. This shows that they value effective communication and are willing to put in the effort to make their co-parenting arrangement work.</p>
   <h2>Tip #3: Be Flexible</h2>
   <p>Co-parenting requires a great deal of flexibility, as schedules and plans can change at a moment's notice. Jennifer Garner advises parents to be open to compromise and to not let their own ego get in the way of what is best for their children. She says, "If you're a control freak, co-parenting is really hard. You have to be willing to not be in control."</p>
   <p>Quantifiable Example: Sheryl Lee Ralph has been known to adjust her work schedule around her children's school activities and events. She also maintains a flexible approach to sharing custody with her ex-husband.</p>
