  <p>As a reality TV star and mother of three, Joy-Anna Duggar has faced her fair share of criticism when it comes to parenting. However, in recent months, the Counting On alum has been breaking away from traditional parenting norms and redefining what it means to be a good mom. Here's how:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>An Interesting Story:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>When Joy-Anna Duggar announced her pregnancy, fans were quick to speculate that something seemed different this time around. In previous pregnancies, Joy-Anna had always been vocal about eagerly anticipating the arrival of her child. Yet this time, she seemed hesitant, even a little scared. In an Instagram post, Joy-Anna shared that she was experiencing "anxiety and fear" about her upcoming birth.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Despite her fears, Joy-Anna went on to deliver a healthy baby boy named Gunner in July 2021. However, it was what happened next that really caught fans' attention.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable Examples:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In the weeks following Gunner's birth, Joy-Anna made a series of unconventional parenting decisions that sparked conversation on social media. For example:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>- Instead of immediately giving birth updates to fans, Joy-Anna waited several days to post photos of her new baby. This decision was met with praise from fans who appreciated the Duggar's newfound emphasis on privacy.</p>
  <p>- Joy-Anna opted to exclusively breastfeed her newborn son, despite previous struggles with breastfeeding her two older children. She documented her journey on social media, even sharing a photo of herself nursing Gunner in public.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>- Joy-Anna also chose to forgo the use of a pacifier, instead soothing her baby with skin-to-skin contact and gentle rocking. This decision received mixed reactions from fans, with some praising Joy-Anna for encouraging natural soothing techniques and others expressing concern about Gunner's ability to self-soothe.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Despite these criticisms, Joy-Anna has remained steadfast in her parenting decisions, continuing to prioritize what is best for her family and her children's well-being.</p>
