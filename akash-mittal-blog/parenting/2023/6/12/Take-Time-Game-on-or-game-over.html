    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Shaurya was a 12-year-old boy who loved playing video games. Every day after school, he would come home, finish his homework and turn on his console to play his favourite games. Initially, his parents didn't mind as they thought it was just a phase. But soon, they realised that Shaurya was spending more time playing games than doing any other activity. He stopped going out to play with his friends, lost interest in studies and barely got any physical exercise. His parents soon realised that this was a serious issue and decided to take measures to help him overcome his addiction to online gaming.</p>
    <p>This is not an isolated case. With the rise in popularity of online gaming, there has been an increase in the number of children and teenagers who are addicted to it. Online gaming addiction is a serious issue and can have detrimental effects on a child's physical and mental health. In this article, we will discuss the effects of online gaming, its addiction among children and what parents can do to help.</p>

    <h2>Effects of online gaming on children</h2>
    <p>Online gaming can have both positive and negative effects on children. On the positive side, it can help improve cognitive function, hand-eye coordination and problem-solving skills. It can also be a form of stress relief and a way for children to socialise with other players.</p>
    <p>On the negative side, online gaming addiction can have a number of detrimental effects on a child's physical and mental health. Children who spend excessive amounts of time playing games may experience eye strain, headaches, backaches and sleep disorders. They may also become socially isolated and experience a decline in academic performance. In extreme cases, online gaming addiction can lead to depression, anxiety and even suicidal thoughts.</p>

    <h2>Statistics on online gaming addiction among children</h2>
    <p>According to a study by the National Institute on Media and the Family, children who play video games for more than 3 hours per day are more likely to suffer from attention problems, lower academic grades, and a higher risk of obesity than children who play for less than an hour a day.</p>
    <p>A survey conducted by the National Center for Health Research found that 8.5% of children aged 8 to 18 years old are addicted to video games. The study also found that 88% of American teenagers between the ages of 13 and 17 play video games, with 45% of them reporting that they play for three or more hours per day.</p>
    <p>These statistics highlight the need for parents to be aware of the risks associated with online gaming addiction and to take measures to prevent their children from becoming addicted.</p>
