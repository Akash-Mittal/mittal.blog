    <p>John, a thirty-five-year-old software engineer, was diagnosed with a brain tumour last year. The news came as a shock to him and his family. The doctors advised him to undergo surgery and follow it up with chemotherapy. However, John decided to add something else to his treatment plan - exercise.</p>
    <p>He started working out every day, switching between different types of physical activity - yoga, aerobic exercise, strength training, walking, cycling and swimming. He noticed that following exercise, he felt more alert and focused, and had a positive outlook on life. Six months after the surgery, John's scans showed that the tumour had shrunk, and he was on his way to recovery.</p>
    <p>This is just one example of how exercise can play a significant role in preventing brain tumours and aiding in recovery.</p>

    <p>According to a study published in the Journal of Health Psychology, regular exercise can help reduce the risk of brain tumours by up to 40%. Another study published in the Journal of Neuro-oncology found that patients who exercised regularly during and after their treatment showed improved cognitive function, better quality of life and fewer side effects of treatment.</p>
    <p>These studies show that exercise can provide quantifiable benefits for both prevention and recovery from brain tumours.</p>

    <h2>Types of Physical Activities for Brain Health</h2>
    <p>Here are six types of physical activities you can incorporate into your routine for good brain health:</p>
    <ul>
     <li><strong>Yoga:</strong> Yoga is a low-impact exercise that combines gentle movements with breathing exercises and meditation. It can reduce stress and improve mental clarity.</li>
     <li><strong>Aerobic Exercise:</strong> Aerobic exercise involves activities that increase heart and breathing rate. These include jogging, biking, swimming and dancing. Aerobic exercise has been shown to improve brain function and reduce cognitive decline.</li>
     <li><strong>Strength Training:</strong> Strength training involves using weights or resistance bands to build muscle and bone strength. It can improve balance, coordination, and cognitive function.</li>
     <li><strong>Walking:</strong> Walking is a simple yet effective exercise that can improve cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of dementia. A brisk walk for 30 minutes a day can make a significant difference in brain health.</li>
     <li><strong>Cycling:</strong> Cycling is a low-impact exercise that can improve cardiovascular health and reduce stress. It can also help with anxiety and depression.</li>
     <li><strong>Swimming:</strong> Swimming is a full-body workout that can improve cardiovascular health and build endurance. It can also improve mood and reduce stress.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is essential to incorporate a variety of exercises into your routine to target different muscle groups, maintain interest and challenge yourself.</p>
