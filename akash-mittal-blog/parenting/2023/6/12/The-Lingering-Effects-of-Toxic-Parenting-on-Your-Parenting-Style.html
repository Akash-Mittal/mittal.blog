     <p>As a new parent, you may have spent a lot of time trying to figure out what kind of parent you want to be. You may have even thought about the kind of parent you DON'T want to be. However, sometimes we may find ourselves parenting unconsciously and being triggered by our own experiences as children, even if we don't want to be.</p>
     <p>Here's an interesting story that illustrates how our upbringing can impact our parenting:</p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>"Growing up, Alice had a difficult relationship with her mom. Her mom was emotionally distant, had high expectations, and was critical of Alice's performance in school and sports. As a result, Alice often felt like she couldn't do anything right and internalized these feelings of inadequacy. Fast forward to when Alice has her own children- she finds herself being ultra-critical of her kids and having very high expectations for them. Her partner notices that Alice sometimes uses words her mom would say like 'you're not trying hard enough' or 'you could do better if you really wanted to'. It's only when Alice recognizes that her own experiences are affecting her parenting that she's able to make changes and become more supportive and less demanding."</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>Alice's story is not uncommon. When we have difficult experiences in our childhood, they can shape our beliefs about the world and ourselves. Here are some examples of how toxic parenting can affect children into adulthood and how it could manifest in your own parenting:</p>
     <h2>The Emotional Effects</h2>
     <p>A child who is raised by a difficult parent may develop negative beliefs about themselves such as "I'm not lovable" or "I'm not good enough", which can make them feel unworthy of love, attention, and affection. This can lead to a number of emotional difficulties such as low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression. If these emotional difficulties go unresolved, they can be passed down to the next generation.</p>
     <h3>Examples:</h3>
     <ul>
      <li>Parenting unconsciously: For instance, if you were raised to believe that your needs weren't important, you may find yourself neglecting your own needs as a parent and putting your child's needs above your own all the time, even when it's not necessary or healthy.</li>
      <li>Becoming emotionally unavailable: Alternatively, you may shut down emotionally and withdraw from your child, just like your own parent did. This can leave your child feeling confused, rejected, and alone.</li>
      <li>Being overprotective: Or, you may become overly protective of your child and not allow them to experience failure or disappointment, wanting to shield them from some of the pain that you went through.</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>The Behavioral Effects</h2>
     <p>If a parent is critical, harsh, controlling or abusive, a child may internalize these behaviors and carry them into their own parenting. Sometimes, this can lead to a cycle of abuse where the abused becomes the abuser. Without intervention, this cycle can continue across many generations.</p>
     <h3>Examples:</h3>
     <ul>
      <li>Becoming the abuser: You may find that you have a low tolerance for your child's mistakes or misbehaviors and use harsh words or punishment to discipline them, just like your own parent did to you.</li>
      <li>Becoming the victim: Alternatively, you may be so afraid of being like your parent that you become a victim of your child's bad behavior, giving in to their demands and not enforcing any rules or boundaries.</li>
      <li>Becoming controlling: In some cases, you may become a controlling parent in order to prevent the chaos you experienced in your own childhood. This can make you feel like you're protecting your child, but can prevent them from learning, growing, and making mistakes on their own.</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>The Cognitive Effects</h2>
     <p>A difficult upbringing can also affect the way a child thinks about the world and others. They may find it difficult to trust, form close relationships, or believe that the world is a safe place. If these beliefs are not challenged, they can continue to shape the child's outlook on life well into adulthood.</p>
     <h3>Examples:</h3>
     <ul>
      <li>Hypervigilance: If you grew up with a parent who was emotionally volatile, you may be hypervigilant for cues that someone in your household is about to explode. This can cause you to be overly reactive and sensitive to anything that could be a potential threat, making it difficult for you to let your guard down and relax.</li>
      <li>Difficulty with intimacy: Alternatively, if you grew up feeling emotionally neglected or abandoned, you may have difficulty forming close, trusting relationships as an adult. This can impact your ability to connect with your child and may make it harder for you to be vulnerable and open with your partner or friends.</li>
      <li>Perfectionism: If you grew up in a home where your grades or achievements were highly valued, you may have developed a need to be perfect in everything you do, with little room for error. This can make it difficult for you to accept your child's imperfections and may cause you to have unrealistic expectations for them.</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>Coping Mechanisms</h2>
     <p>If you recognize any of these effects in your parenting style, there is hope. You can break these patterns and heal from the past. Here are some practical tips:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>Talk about it. Share your experiences and feelings with someone you trust. This can help you gain new insights and perspectives.</li>
      <li>Practice self-reflection. Think about your own beliefs and values around parenting and question whether they are serving you and your child or whether they are based on your own unresolved issues.</li>
      <li>Be intentional. Decide what kind of parent you want to be and make conscious choices that reflect your values, even if they challenge your old patterns of behavior.</li>
     </ol>
