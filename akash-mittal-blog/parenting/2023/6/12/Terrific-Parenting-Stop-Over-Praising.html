    <p>When my daughter was in second grade, she came home one day and told me about a peer who had been praised by the teacher for every little thing, including getting out of his chair to get a pencil. Rachel, my daughter, felt that it was unfair since she and others in the class got out of their chairs "all the time and no one seemed to care."</p>
    <p>Over-praising can create a sense of entitlement, lack of self-awareness, and self-esteem that is dependent on external factors such as praise and approval. It sets unrealistic expectations and leads to a mindset of perfectionism, where anything less than perfect is seen as a failure.</p>
    <h2>Quantifiable examples of over-praising</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>A child is awarded a trophy for just showing up at a sports event, regardless of their performance.</li>
     <li>A child is praised for every little thing they do, even tasks that are expected of them.</li>
     <li>A child is given a prize for completing a task, regardless of the quality of their work.</li>
     <li>A child receives a high grade for an assignment, even though it is clear that the work was not up to par.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Why over-praising can be harmful</h2>
    <p>Over-praising creates unrealistic expectations and sets the child up for disappointment when they face life's challenges, which are not always easy or pleasant. It can also lead to a sense of entitlement, where the child believes that they are entitled to praise and rewards for every little thing they do. This can lead to a lack of motivation and a sense of complacency that is detrimental to their personal growth and success.</p>
    <p>Over-praising also breeds a fear of failure, as children become overly dependent on external validation and lose confidence in their own abilities. This can lead to a lack of resilience and perseverance, which are essential skills for success in any endeavor.</p>
    <h2>Three points to consider</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>Be specific with your praise. Instead of saying, "Good job!" or "You're amazing!", tell your child exactly what they did well. For example, "I am so proud of you for working so hard on that project. Your determination and creativity really paid off!"</li>
     <li>Acknowledge effort, not just results. Instead of praising your child only when they succeed, acknowledge their effort and hard work, even when they don't succeed. This helps them develop a growth mindset and a sense of self-worth that is not dependent on external factors.</li>
     <li>Encourage self-reflection. Teach your child to reflect on their own efforts and progress, and to set their own goals. This helps them develop self-awareness, an essential skill for personal and social development.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Over-praising is a common parenting mistake that can have negative consequences for your child's development. By being specific with your praise, acknowledging effort, and encouraging self-reflection, you can help your child develop a healthy sense of self-worth and resilience that will serve them well in all aspects of their lives.</p>
