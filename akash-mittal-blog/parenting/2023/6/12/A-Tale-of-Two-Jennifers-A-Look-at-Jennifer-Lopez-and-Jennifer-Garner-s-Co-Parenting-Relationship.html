   <p>It's not often that two Hollywood leading ladies are linked by something other than their craft. But in the case of Jennifer Lopez and Jennifer Garner, it's their relationship with Ben Affleck that has brought them together. Aside from being Ben's former flames, the two are also bonded by the fact that Lopez's two children, Emme and Max, are step-siblings to Garner's three children, Violet, Seraphina and Samuel.</p>
   <p>While one might assume that a situation like this could lead to drama, both women have taken a mature approach and have embraced the situation, forming a close bond and co-parenting their children together. Here's a closer look at their relationship, and what other blended families can learn from their example.</p>
   <h2>Quantifiable examples of their co-parenting relationship</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Both Lopez and Garner have regularly been seen attending their children's events together, such as soccer games and birthday parties, putting aside any differences they may have had for the sake of their children's happiness.</li>
    <li>In a 2018 interview with PBS NewsHour, Garner spoke about Lopez's involvement in her children's lives, stating that the singer and actress has "been a great support to me and to the kids."</li>
    <li>Lopez has also spoken about her relationship with Garner, stating in a 2017 interview with HOLA! USA, "I have so much respect for her. I think she's a great mother, she's a great actress, a great friend."</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>The benefits of co-parenting</h2>
   <p>While co-parenting can be a challenging notion for some, the benefits for the children involved are immeasurable. Here are just a few of the advantages:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Children benefit from having consistent rules and routines, and co-parenting ensures that both households are on the same page.</li>
    <li>Children are able to maintain important relationships with all of their parents, ensuring a stronger sense of security and stability.</li>
