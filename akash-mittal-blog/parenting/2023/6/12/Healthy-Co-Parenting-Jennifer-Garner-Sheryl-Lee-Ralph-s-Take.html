    <h2> Healthy Co-Parenting</h2>
    <p>According to a study by University of Virginia, children whose parents have an amicable relationship after divorce have fewer mental health issues and academic struggles. This is exactly what Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck are trying to achieve with their three kids, Violet, Seraphina, and Samuel. Despite their divorce in 2018, they have been co-parenting effectively and are often seen attending family events together.</p>
    <p>Sheryl Lee Ralph, on the other hand, has been co-parenting with her ex-husband Eric Maurice for over 30 years and has a son, Etienne Maurice. They have maintained a cordial relationship and have even celebrated holidays together. Ralph believes that co-parenting is not just about the parents but also about the children.</p>
    <p>A study by American Sociological Review found that kids of separated parents have higher chances of emotional distress, behavioral problems, and low academic performance. However, co-parenting done right can make all the difference. Another study by The Journal of Pediatrics showed that children of divorced parents who had joint physical custody had better mental health, self-esteem, and family relationships compared to those who had sole custody.</p>

    <h2> and Practical Tips</h2>
    <p>Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck have been a role model for many divorcing couples who aspire to co-parent effectively. Garner, in an interview with Today, said that their top priority is their children and they even have a "family meeting" where they discuss anything and everything related to their kids. She also revealed that they make a conscious effort to not speak badly about each other in front of their children and to be present for important events like concerts and sports games.</p>
    <p>Sheryl Lee Ralph also believes in being respectful and keeping the children's interests above everything else. She told Essence that when they got divorced, they had a conversation about the type of relationship they wanted to have for their child and decided to be flexible and patient with each other. She further added that they also made a conscious effort to not involve their son in any conflict or negative conversations.</p>
    <p>Here are some practical tips for healthy co-parenting:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Communicate clearly and frequently about important events, schoolwork, and medical appointments</li>
     <li>Be respectful of each other and do not involve the children in any negative conversations or arguments</li>
     <li>Stay flexible and be open to compromise</li>
     <li>Ensure that the children spend equal time with each parent, if possible</li>
     <li>Maintain a cordial relationship with each other's families</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is the responsibility of both parents to create a healthy co-parenting dynamic that puts the children's needs first.</p>
