     <p>When Sarah and her husband found out they were expecting their first child, they were thrilled. They had been planning and hoping for a baby for years and were excited to start this new chapter of their lives.</p>
     <p>But pregnancy turned out to be more challenging than they had anticipated. Sarah experienced severe morning sickness and exhaustion throughout the first trimester, and struggled with anxiety and depression as her due date approached.</p>
     <p>It was during this time that Sarah first heard about the Central Hawke's Bay Ruahine Whakawhanau Tamariki, or the Pregnancy and Parenting Hub. The Hub is a community organization that provides a range of supports to parents and caregivers in the Central Hawke's Bay area, from prenatal education and midwifery services to postpartum care and parenting classes.</p>
     <p>At first, Sarah was hesitant to get involved. She was worried that she would be judged or that the Hub would be too clinical or impersonal. But after attending a few events and workshops, she realized that the opposite was true.</p>
     <p>"The people I've met through the Hub have been so warm and welcoming," she says. "They've helped me feel more confident in my abilities as a mom, and have given me practical advice and support throughout my pregnancy and postpartum journey."</p>
     <p>The Hub has also given Sarah and her husband the opportunity to connect with other parents in the community. They've attended playgroups and social events, and have made friends with people who understand the joys and challenges of parenthood.</p>
     <p>"It's been such a lifeline for us," Sarah says. "Knowing that we have this amazing network of people who care about us and are there for us has made all the difference."</p>
