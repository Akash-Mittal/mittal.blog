    <h2>A New Way of Creating Families</h2>
    <p>For many, the traditional model of family building may no longer be the only option or even the most desirable one. Platonic co-parenting offers an opportunity for individuals to create a family with someone they trust, love and respect, without the baggage of romantic complications.</p>
    <p>The practice is widespread, the number of people driving international co-parenting agreements has risen 10 percent annually since 2015. While there are no reliable statistics on the number of children created through platonic co-parenting, the trend has been growing for several years. According to the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, online platforms for co-parent connections have increased globally by 1700% since 2010.</p>

    <h2>The Benefits of Co-Parenting</h2>
    <p>Although platonic co-parenting may not be for everyone, it has several benefits. For one, it offers a chance to share the financial and emotional responsibilities of raising a child. It also allows for a more flexible lifestyle, as the co-parents can work out their schedules to suit each other. Besides, it makes parenting accessible to individuals who are not ready for marriage or face legal challenges due to gender, marital status or sexual orientation. Co-parenting can create a supportive environment for children, bringing together a community of individuals who have a shared love for them.</p>
    <p>Laura Steinberg, a 30-year-old New Yorker, is a single mother who entered into a co-parenting arrangement with a gay couple, Bill and Kelly. Laura says their arrangement has been a beautiful and heartwarming experience for her and her son. "Our son is being raised by a village that loves and cares for him. We share everything and the burden is lighter".</p>

    <h2>Things to Consider Before Co-Parenting</h2>
    <p>Before entering into a platonic co-parenting relationship, it is critical to consider the following:</p>
    <ul>
     <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> The co-parents must share the same values, goals and parenting styles</li>
     <li><strong>Legal and Medical Considerations:</strong> As with all parenting decisions, there are legal and medical considerations to consider, such as custody, support agreements and medical decisions for the child.</li>
     <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Communication is key in any relationship, but it is even more so in co-parenting. Make sure you have open and honest communication with your co-parent about everything concerning the child, from discipline to education to medical care.</li>
    </ul>
