Shaurya was a 12-year-old boy who loved playing video games. Every day after school, he would come home, finish his homework and turn on his console to play his favourite games. Initially, his parents didn't mind as they thought it was just a phase. But soon, they realised that Shaurya was spending more time playing games than doing any other activity. He stopped going out to play with his friends, lost interest in studies and barely got any physical exercise. His parents soon realised that this was a serious issue and decided to take measures to help him overcome his addiction to online gaming.
This is not an isolated case. With the rise in popularity of online gaming, there has been an increase in the number of children and teenagers who are addicted to it. Online gaming addiction is a serious issue and can have detrimental effects on a child's physical and mental health. In this article, we will discuss the effects of online gaming, its addiction among children and what parents can do to help.
Online gaming can have both positive and negative effects on children. On the positive side, it can help improve cognitive function, hand-eye coordination and problem-solving skills. It can also be a form of stress relief and a way for children to socialise with other players.
On the negative side, online gaming addiction can have a number of detrimental effects on a child's physical and mental health. Children who spend excessive amounts of time playing games may experience eye strain, headaches, backaches and sleep disorders. They may also become socially isolated and experience a decline in academic performance. In extreme cases, online gaming addiction can lead to depression, anxiety and even suicidal thoughts.
According to a study by the National Institute on Media and the Family, children who play video games for more than 3 hours per day are more likely to suffer from attention problems, lower academic grades, and a higher risk of obesity than children who play for less than an hour a day.
A survey conducted by the National Center for Health Research found that 8.5% of children aged 8 to 18 years old are addicted to video games. The study also found that 88% of American teenagers between the ages of 13 and 17 play video games, with 45% of them reporting that they play for three or more hours per day.

When my daughter was in second grade, she came home one day and told me about a peer who had been praised by the teacher for every little thing, including getting out of his chair to get a pencil. Rachel, my daughter, felt that it was unfair since she and others in the class got out of their chairs ""all the time and no one seemed to care.""
Over-praising can create a sense of entitlement, lack of self-awareness, and self-esteem that is dependent on external factors such as praise and approval. It sets unrealistic expectations and leads to a mindset of perfectionism, where anything less than perfect is seen as a failure.
Over-praising creates unrealistic expectations and sets the child up for disappointment when they face life's challenges, which are not always easy or pleasant. It can also lead to a sense of entitlement, where the child believes that they are entitled to praise and rewards for every little thing they do. This can lead to a lack of motivation and a sense of complacency that is detrimental to their personal growth and success.
Over-praising also breeds a fear of failure, as children become overly dependent on external validation and lose confidence in their own abilities. This can lead to a lack of resilience and perseverance, which are essential skills for success in any endeavor.
Over-praising is a common parenting mistake that can have negative consequences for your child's development. By being specific with your praise, acknowledging effort, and encouraging self-reflection, you can help your child develop a healthy sense of self-worth and resilience that will serve them well in all aspects of their lives.

It's Saturday morning and you're about to enjoy your first cup of coffee of the day. But before you can take a sip, your child reminds you that they have a game at 9 a.m. and they can't find their uniform. Suddenly, your heart starts racing and your adrenaline kicks in. You know that finding that uniform is the only thing that matters right now.
This scenario is all too familiar for parents who have children involved in sports. It's not just about the early morning games and the endless practices, it's also about the chaos that can ensue when something goes missing. Whether it's a missing uniform, a forgotten water bottle, or a lost ball, the adrenaline of searching for these items can be overwhelming.
According to a survey conducted by the National Alliance for Youth Sports, parents spend an average of $671 per year on their child's sports activities. This includes uniforms, equipment, fees, and travel costs. But more than just the financial investment, parents also invest a lot of time and emotional energy into their children's sports experiences.
Another study found that parents spend an average of 6 hours per week on their child's sports activities, including transportation, practice time, and game time. That's a significant amount of time that could be spent on other pursuits, but for many parents, it's worth it to see their child excel in their favorite sport.

Imagine two parents who are struggling to raise their child. They love their child dearly and want nothing but the best for him/her, but sometimes they fall short. They argue, they yell, they punish. It's not that they don't care, it's just that they don't know how to be good parents.
Unfortunately, this is a scenario that plays out in households around the world. Despite the potential for love and understanding, the dynamic between children and parents is extremely complex, fraught with the risk of hurt and pain on both sides. It is also -- unsurprisingly -- the source of many emotional difficulties we face in life.
So what is the best kept secret of healthy parenting? It's quite simple, actually. The best kept secret is that there is no secret at all. No magic formula or method that can guarantee success. Rather, healthy parenting requires a combination of factors, including:
By incorporating these factors into your parenting style, you can create a healthy and loving environment for your child to grow up in. But don't just take my word for it, let's look at some quantifiable examples.
Studies have shown that children who grow up in healthy environments have:
These are just a few examples, but they demonstrate the positive impact that healthy parenting can have on a child's life.
In conclusion, healthy parenting is not a secret at all. It involves a combination of love, structure, positive reinforcement, communication, and good role modeling. By incorporating these factors into your parenting style, you can create a healthy and loving environment for your child to grow up in.
Remember, parenting is a journey, not a destination. You won't get it right all the time, but as long as you keep trying and keep your child's best interests in mind, you'll do just fine.
When my child was going through a difficult phase, I found that incorporating positive reinforcement into our daily routine made a huge difference. Instead of focusing on the negative behaviors, I would praise her for the good things she did. Over time, her behavior improved and our relationship grew stronger.

Once upon a time, in Hollywood, two women named Jennifer met each other under unusual circumstances. They were both previously married to the same man, Ben Affleck. Jennifer Lopez was engaged to him in 2002 and was known as ""Bennifer"" at the time. Meanwhile, Jennifer Garner was married to him from 2005 to 2018 and had three children with him.
Years later, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck rekindled their romance and became one of the hottest celebrity couples of 2021. However, what's interesting is how their relationship has affected Jennifer Garner and Jennifer Lopez's dynamic as co-parents. Instead of becoming rivals, they chose to support each other, and their children, together.
According to sources close to the situation, Jennifer Lopez and Jennifer Garner have developed a ""true friendship."" They're not just co-parenting out of obligation to their children's father; they genuinely enjoy each other's company and have bonded over the challenges of blended families.
This friendship has manifested in various ways, such as:
Additionally, Jennifer Lopez has gone out of her way to show respect for Jennifer Garner as a mother figure to her stepchildren. In an interview with ""HOLA! USA,"" J.Lo said, ""It was important for me to get to know [Jennifer]. She's a lovely person, and I'm lucky to have her in my life."" She also said that she hopes to set an example for her own children about how to treat their step-siblings and their parents.
While Jennifer Lopez and Jennifer Garner's co-parenting relationship is unique in some ways, it's not uncommon for blended families to face similar challenges. Here are a few case studies and anecdotes to illustrate this:
Sharon and Tom got divorced when their son was six years old. A few years later, Sharon started dating a man named James, and they eventually got married. Tom got remarried to a woman named Rachel, and they had two children together. As a result, their son has four parents: Sharon, James, Tom, and Rachel.
At first, communication between all parties was strained. Sharon and Tom had unresolved issues to work out, and James and Rachel felt like outsiders in the equation. However, they all agreed that their son's well-being was their top priority.
Over time, they learned that open and honest communication was key to making things work. They started having regular family meetings where they could discuss schedules, concerns, and any issues that arose. They also made an effort to attend school events, sports games

Have you ever been amazed by an image that looks like something else until it suddenly changes before your eyes? Or have you ever stared at a pattern that seemed to move or warp even though it stayed still? If so, you have encountered an optical illusion.
Optical illusions are images that deceive our brains into perceiving something that is not there or that is different from what is actually there. They challenge our minds by tricking our visual perception, forcing us to see the world in a different way. These illusions are not just eye candy, they are also tools for testing our problem-solving, observation, and analytical skills.
Let's explore this fascinating world of optical illusions and understand how they work.
Optical illusions are created when our eyes send conflicting signals to our brain. The eyes see one thing, but the brain interprets it as something else. This is because our brains rely on past experiences and expectations to make sense of what we see. When there is a discrepancy between what we see and what we expect to see, the brain tries to reconcile the difference by altering or distorting our perception.
There are many different types of optical illusions, but they all exploit some aspect of our visual system. Some illusions play with our sense of depth and distance, while others manipulate our perception of motion, size, or color. Some illusions are based on hidden images or ambiguous figures that can be interpreted in multiple ways.
Here are some well-known optical illusions that demonstrate how our brains can be tricked:
These examples show how illusions can fool our brains into perceiving something that is not actually there, or into misjudging the properties of an object or scene.
Optical illusions are not just a fun diversion, they also offer benefits for our brains. Some of the benefits of engaging with optical illusions include:
If you want to create your own optical illusions or explore existing ones, here are some tips to keep in mind:
Optical illusions are more than just entertaining tricks for the eyes. They are windows into the complex workings of our visual system and opportunities to challenge our minds and creativity. By exploring the fascinating world of optical illusions, we can learn how our brains make sense of the world and how we can use our perception to create new and interesting experiences. So the next time you come across an optical illusion, take a moment to appreciate the wonders of the human mind.

Have you ever been amazed by an image that looks like something else until it suddenly changes before your eyes? Or have you ever stared at a pattern that seemed to move or warp even though it stayed still? If so, you have encountered an optical illusion.
Optical illusions are images that deceive our brains into perceiving something that is not there or that is different from what is actually there. They challenge our minds by tricking our visual perception, forcing us to see the world in a different way. These illusions are not just eye candy, they are also tools for testing our problem-solving, observation, and analytical skills.

It was Saturday morning, and all was quiet in the house. I had just poured myself a cup of coffee and was about to take a sip when I heard a shout from my son's room. ""Mom! I can't find my uniform!""
My heart sank. This was not unusual. In fact, it happened almost every weekend during sports season. But somehow, the panic in my son's voice made me feel like this time was different. I sighed, took a sip of my coffee, and got up to help him look.
The next hour was a blur of searching through laundry baskets, checking the car for any forgotten bags, and calling other parents to see if they had an extra uniform. We finally found it buried under a pile of clothes in my son's closet. As I collapsed onto the couch, exhausted from the search, I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of it all.
Parents all over Twitter also know the struggle of searching for a lost uniform:
These examples show just how common and relatable the struggles of parenthood can be. It's comforting to know that we're not alone in feeling overwhelmed or frustrated.

It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon when the father, John, decided to take his two sons, Mark and Luke, to the park. The little boys were excited, jumping up and down with anticipation for the fun they were about to have. John noticed their excitement and couldn't help but think about his own childhood memories of going to the park with his dad. As he watched his sons run and play, he knew that he wanted to instill the same love and values in them that his father had instilled in him.
Parenting is not an easy job. It is a privilege and a responsibility that requires dedication, patience, and unconditional love. Christian parenting, in particular, presents unique challenges as it involves not only raising children but also teaching them how to live a life based on biblical principles. As Mark Houck, founder of The King's Men, states, ""It begins and ends with the father.""
Research has shown that fathers play a critical role in the upbringing of their children. Fathers who are involved in their children's lives have children who are more likely to succeed academically, socially, and emotionally. They also have a lower incidence of behavioral problems, substance abuse, and juvenile delinquency.
However, the role of the father in Christian parenting extends beyond these benefits. Fathers are called to be spiritual leaders in their families, to teach their children the word of God, and to model the love and compassion of Jesus Christ. This is not an easy task, but it is a necessary one.
So, how can fathers effectively carry out their role in Christian parenting? Here are some practical tips:
John watched as his sons played together, laughing and having fun. He knew that his role as a father was critical to their growth, both as individuals and as Christians. He embraced this role with joy and determination, knowing that the rewards were immeasurable.
As Christian fathers, we have the power to shape the lives of our children in a profound way. Let us embrace this responsibility with dedication, humility, and love. Let us be the fathers God has called us to be.
To summarize, Christian parenting begins and ends with the father. The role of the father is critical to the upbringing of children, both in terms of their academic and emotional well-being and their spiritual growth. By leading by example, teaching the word of God, being present in our children's lives, and showing unconditional love, we can fulfill our role as fathers and raise children who will li

At a recent parenting convention, Jennifer Garner, the Hollywood actress and mother of three, gave a heartfelt speech that left the audience deeply touched. She spoke about how despite the messy, chaotic, and often-exhausting experience of parenting, it is still the most beautiful and fulfilling thing she has ever done.
Jennifer began her talk by sharing a personal anecdote about how after a long and tiring day on set, all she wanted to do was go back home and snuggle with her kids. She spoke about how the love and joy that comes from being a parent are not just limited to the good days but are often amplified during the tough times. It is the late-night feedings, the tantrums, and the endless laundry that make parenting a messy but joyful experience.
Following her anecdote, Jennifer spoke about how parenting, like most worthwhile things in life, involves a willingness to embrace the unknown. Each day as a parent comes with its unique set of challenges, but it's how we choose to approach those challenges that define the experience. Jennifer believes that the messy parts of parenting are not something to be avoided or suppressed but, rather, should be celebrated for the role they play in shaping our children and ourselves as parents.
""Parenting is a gift,"" she said, ""It's an opportunity to love someone unconditionally, to teach and guide them, and to experience the joy that comes from watching them grow.""
While Jennifer's speech was full of emotion and heart, she didn't shy away from the practicalities of parenting. She spoke about some of the quantifiable ways in which parenting can have a positive impact on our lives, including:
After listening to Jennifer's speech, it's clear that she sees parenting as a joyful mess of ups and downs, a gift that offers us the opportunity to grow and learn alongside our children. While there are undoubtedly difficult moments, the love and joy that come from being a parent more than make up for them. For those of us who are parents, it's a reminder to embrace the messiness and to find joy in even the toughest moments.
In conclusion, here are three key takeaways from Jennifer's speech:

As a new parent, you may have spent a lot of time trying to figure out what kind of parent you want to be. You may have even thought about the kind of parent you DON'T want to be. However, sometimes we may find ourselves parenting unconsciously and being triggered by our own experiences as children, even if we don't want to be.
Here's an interesting story that illustrates how our upbringing can impact our parenting:
""Growing up, Alice had a difficult relationship with her mom. Her mom was emotionally distant, had high expectations, and was critical of Alice's performance in school and sports. As a result, Alice often felt like she couldn't do anything right and internalized these feelings of inadequacy. Fast forward to when Alice has her own children- she finds herself being ultra-critical of her kids and having very high expectations for them. Her partner notices that Alice sometimes uses words her mom would say like 'you're not trying hard enough' or 'you could do better if you really wanted to'. It's only when Alice recognizes that her own experiences are affecting her parenting that she's able to make changes and become more supportive and less demanding.""
Alice's story is not uncommon. When we have difficult experiences in our childhood, they can shape our beliefs about the world and ourselves. Here are some examples of how toxic parenting can affect children into adulthood and how it could manifest in your own parenting:
A child who is raised by a difficult parent may develop negative beliefs about themselves such as ""I'm not lovable"" or ""I'm not good enough"", which can make them feel unworthy of love, attention, and affection. This can lead to a number of emotional difficulties such as low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression. If these emotional difficulties go unresolved, they can be passed down to the next generation.
If a parent is critical, harsh, controlling or abusive, a child may internalize these behaviors and carry them into their own parenting. Sometimes, this can lead to a cycle of abuse where the abused becomes the abuser. Without intervention, this cycle can continue across many generations.
A difficult upbringing can also affect the way a child thinks about the world and others. They may find it difficult to trust, form close relationships, or believe that the world is a safe place. If these beliefs are not challenged, they can continue to shape the child's outlook on life well into adulthood.
If you recognize any of these effec

If a parent is critical, harsh, controlling or abusive, a child may internalize these behaviors and carry them into their own parenting. Sometimes, this can lead to a cycle of abuse where the abused becomes the abuser. Without intervention, this cycle can continue across many generations.
A difficult upbringing can also affect the way a child thinks about the world and others. They may find it difficult to trust, form close relationships, or believe that the world is a safe place. If these beliefs are not challenged, they can continue to shape the child's outlook on life well into adulthood.
If you recognize any of these effects in your parenting style, there is hope. You can break these patterns and heal from the past. Here are some practical tips:

When Joo-yeon Kim, a 29-year-old marketing manager in Seoul, got married last year, she and her husband decided not to have children right away. Instead, they chose to focus on their careers and enjoy their newlywed life as a double income, no kids (DINK) couple.
""We both have demanding jobs and we like to travel and try new things. Having children would mean sacrificing a lot of our time and money, and we are not ready for that yet,"" Kim said.
Kim is not alone in her decision. According to a recent survey by Shinhan Life Insurances, more and more young Koreans are choosing to delay or forego parenthood due to the high cost of raising children and shifting personal values.
Raising a child in South Korea is one of the most expensive endeavors for young couples. The cost of education, daycare, healthcare, and housing can easily exceed the average household income, making it financially challenging for many families to have more than one child.
According to a report by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, the cost of raising a child from birth to age 18 in South Korea averages around 260 million won ($226,000), which is one of the highest in the world.
For young couples like Kim and her husband, who are just starting their careers and have high student debts, raising a child seems like an unaffordable luxury.
Besides financial constraints, young Koreans are also reevaluating their personal values and priorities, which are no longer centered around traditional family dynamics.
South Korea has a rapidly aging population and a low birthrate, which has prompted the government to encourage more young couples to have children. However, many young Koreans see parenthood as a burden rather than a blessing.
According to the same Shinhan Life Insurances survey, 42% of respondents said they would prefer not to have children, citing reasons such as loss of freedom, fear of the future, and lack of interest in childrearing.
The DINK lifestyle, which originated in the 1980s in the United States, refers to a couple who both work and have no children by choice. This lifestyle has become increasingly popular among young Koreans who value their personal and professional independence.

It's never easy when your child starts using foul language. Whether they picked it up from friends, TV shows, or just the general environment, parents don't want to hear their six-year-olds using words that no kid should know. But how do you stop your little one from swearing when they don't seem to listen? Here's a guide to help you manage a potty-mouthed child.
Jenny, a mother of three, had always tried to watch her language around her kids. But no matter how careful she was, her six-year-old, Max, started using the F-word regularly. At first, she thought it was a harmless phase, but as time went on, he continued to use the word frequently. Jenny had tried everything from logical explanations to punishment, but nothing seemed to work. She was at a loss for what to do.
If you've been in a similar situation, don't despair. Here are some tips to manage a child's foul-mouth:
Talk to your child about why using certain words is not okay and how it can be hurtful to others. Make sure you use language they can understand and be honest about your feelings. You can also use books or examples to help your child understand the importance of using respectful language. Remember to have an open dialog with your child, ask them to share their thoughts on why they use certain words, and try to figure out what triggers them to do so.
Let your child know that using inappropriate language is not acceptable and explain the consequences if they repeat it. These consequences should be clear and consistent, and not too severe that they hurt your child's self-esteem. Consequences may include short-term punishments like taking away privileges or being grounded. It's essential to explain to your child that using respectful language shows maturity, respect, and kindness, which are values you want your child to have.
Make sure you praise your child when they use respectful language, especially in challenging situations. Positive reinforcement can go a long way in not only creating good behavior but also improving your relationship with your child. You can also come up with fun games or rewards that encourage your child to use respectful language more often.
As a parent myself, I know how difficult it can be to manage your child's behavior. My son, Jake, started using inappropriate language when he was seven. At first, I didn't know how to react, but after sitting down with him and talking about why it wasn't okay, he slowly stopped swearing. I also made sure to positively rein

As Sarah gazed at the beautiful sunset from her balcony, she realized that her life was not the same anymore. She was married, had a good job, and lived in a nice apartment. But, she and her husband Jake had decided not to have any children. This decision was not easy for them, but they both felt that they were not ready to give up their freedom and their lifestyle. Sarah knew that her decision was not unique. According to a recent report, millennial parents are having fewer babies, even in Utah, the state with the highest birth rate in the United States.
The report revealed that Utah's birth rate has been declining steadily for the last few years. In 2019, Utah had a birth rate of 11.2 per 1,000 people, which is slightly higher than the national average of 10.5. However, the birth rate in Utah has been declining consistently since 2007, when it was at 19.0 per 1,000 people.
One of the main reasons for this decline in the birth rate is that America is becoming less religious. Religion is pro-family because it fosters norms, infrastructure, and culture that make parenting easier. Religious communities provide social support, childcare options, and a sense of belonging. However, millennials are less religious than their parents and grandparents. According to a recent study, only 42% of millennials identify as religious, compared to 70% of baby boomers and 62% of Gen Xers.
Another reason for the decline in the birth rate is the rising cost of living. Millennials face higher student debt, higher housing costs, and lower wages than previous generations. They are delaying major life milestones, such as marriage and having children, because they cannot afford them. In addition, they want to pursue their careers and travel, and having children does not fit into their plans.
Emily was a 32-year-old millennial who lived in San Francisco. She had a good job, but she was struggling with the high cost of living. She had already postponed her wedding because she could not afford it, and having a child was simply out of the question. She said, ""I would love to have a child, but I cannot afford to pay for the childcare, the healthcare, and the education. I also want to travel and enjoy my life, and having a child would limit my options.""

As an accomplished actress, comedian, and writer, Jennifer Coolidge is widely recognized for her talent on screen. But the GQ interview with Coolidge took a turn when the topic of parenting came up, and she proclaimed that it does not necessarily make one ""mature.""

As a society, we often idealize parenting as a hallmark of maturity. However, the reality is that having children does not guarantee personal growth or emotional maturity. Here are three points to debunk Coolidge's perspective and explain why parenting is not a prerequisite for maturity.

1. Maturity stems from personal development, not external factors

Maturity is not something that can be attained by checking off certain life events, such as getting married or having children. Rather, it is a state of mind that is achieved through personal growth and introspection.

While parenting can certainly be a catalyst for personal development, it is not the only path to maturity. Some people may find maturity through travel, volunteer work, or pursuing their passions. It is important to recognize that everyone's journey to maturity is unique, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach.
