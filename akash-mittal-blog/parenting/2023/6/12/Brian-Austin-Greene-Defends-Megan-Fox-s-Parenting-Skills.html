   <h2>The Story</h2>
   <p>Megan Fox and Brian Austin Greene were married for 10 years and have three children together. Despite their divorce, they have maintained a healthy co-parenting relationship for the sake of their kids. However, when film director Robby Starbuck attacked Fox's parenting skills on Twitter, Greene came to her defense.</p>
   <p>Starbuck tweeted, "Megan Fox is a terrible mother. She only posts pics of her in lingerie and her kids are nowhere in sight. Why did Brian Austin Greene give his son a female name? Weird." Greene responded, "It's very unfortunate that you have to attack my ex wife in the same breath that you try to spread awareness about a legitimate issue. It's not news that Megan has a great body. What is news is the fact that you're a stranger criticizing my parenting skills for no reason whatsoever."</p>
   <p>Greene's response was applauded by many on social media, with some even thanking him for being a good co-parenting partner.</p>
   
   <ul>
    <li>In a survey of divorced parents, only 12% listed "getting along with ex-spouse" as a priority, yet studies show that when parents are able to co-parent successfully, children experience fewer behavioral problems and have healthier relationships in their adult lives.</li>
    <li>Research has also shown that children of high-conflict divorced parents are more likely to experience depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues.</li>
    <li>On the other hand, children of co-parenting partnerships tend to have higher self-esteem, better academic performance, and lower rates of substance abuse.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2></h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Co-parenting can be challenging, but it's important for the well-being of your children.</li>
    <li>Maintaining a positive relationship with your ex-spouse can benefit your children in countless ways.</li>
    <li>Defending your ex-partner, when appropriate, can help reinforce that positive relationship and set a good example for your children.</li>
   </ul>
   
   <p>When my parents got divorced, they could not have been more different in their parenting styles. My dad was strict, regimented, and focused on discipline. My mom was more laid-back, permissive, and focused on having fun with us.</p>
   <p>It was a difficult transition, to say the least. But despite their differences, they both made a concerted effort to get along and co-parent effectively. They attended events together, communicated openly about our well-being, and made sure we never felt like pawns in their divorce.</p>
   <p>In the end, I can honestly say that I am grateful for their efforts. While it wasn't always easy, having two parents who were dedicated to our well-being, even after they split up, made a huge difference in my life.</p>
   <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Put aside your differences and focus on your children's well-being.</li>
    <li>Communicate openly and respectfully with your ex-partner about your children's needs and schedules.</li>
    <li>Acknowledge and praise your ex-partner's good parenting when appropriate.</li>
    <li>Try to attend events together, such as school plays or sports games, to show your children that you can still be a united front.</li>
    <li>Consider seeing a co-parenting counselor if you're struggling to make it work.</li>
   </ul>
