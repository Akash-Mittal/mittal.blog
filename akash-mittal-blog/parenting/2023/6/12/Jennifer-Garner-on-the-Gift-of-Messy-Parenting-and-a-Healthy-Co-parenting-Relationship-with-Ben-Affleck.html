  <p>Introduction:</p>
  <p>It's not uncommon for celebrities to make headlines with highly publicized, acrimonious divorces and messy co-parenting relationships. However, Jennifer Garner has been an exception to this norm. Instead, she has repeatedly spoken about the joys and challenges of parenting and co-parenting, even in the face of divorce. In a recent interview with Sheryl Lee Ralph on Variety's Actors on Actors series, Garner revealed that she considers the mess of parenting to be a gift, and shared insights into her healthy co-parenting relationship with ex-husband Ben Affleck.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Interesting Story:</p>
  <p>Garner's journey with parenting started almost 15 years ago when she welcomed her first child, Violet. She has since gone on to have two more children with Affleck: Seraphina and Samuel. In the interview, Garner spoke about how parenting has been one of the hardest things she has ever done. She recounted a story where she was on a plane with her husband and crying baby and just wanted to disappear into thin air. However, she expressed the view that all the messiness of parenting is what makes it a true gift.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable examples:</p>
  <p>Garner has been open about her parenting journey, showing that celebrities are not immune to the everyday struggles of raising children. She has shared about going to therapy to cope with the challenges of parenting, including her fears of passing on negative traits to her kids. Garner also remains very involved in her kid's education and extracurricular activities, despite her demanding schedule. She often posts on social media about her kids' sports games or school events that she's attending.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Garner and Affleck have also been exemplary in their co-parenting relationship. They have often been seen together attending events and dropping off and picking up their kids from school, showing that they are united in their parenting roles. The pair make sure their kids have a stable home environment by spending holidays and vacations together as well.</p>

  <p></p>
  <p>1. Embrace the messiness of parenting: Jennifer Garner sees parenting as a gift, even in the midst of its messy nature. Whether you're a celebrity or not, parenting is hard, but it's important to remember that the messiness is what makes it worthwhile.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Focus on what matters: Garner and Affleck's co-parenting relationship focuses on what matters most - their kids' well-being. They set aside their personal differences to work together in their roles as parents.</p>
  <p></p>
