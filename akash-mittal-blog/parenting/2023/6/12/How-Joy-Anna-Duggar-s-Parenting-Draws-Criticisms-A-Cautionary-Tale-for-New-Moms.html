  <p>Having a new baby can be both exciting and nerve-wracking. As a new mom, you want to be sure to take the best care of your baby. But even with all the books, websites, and advice out there, it can be a daunting task. For reality TV star Joy-Anna Duggar, it's no different. But with being a public figure comes the added pressure of scrutiny from fans and critics alike. Recently, Joy-Anna was called out by some Duggar critics for a decision she made about her newborn son, Gunner.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In a set of photos posted on Instagram, Joy-Anna can be seen holding Gunner while shopping at a store. Some people noticed that the baby wasn't wearing shoes. While this may seem like a small detail, it sparked criticism over Joy-Anna's parenting skills. Some commenters suggested that not having shoes on a baby could lead to health problems, especially if the baby is exposed to germs or cold surfaces.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>It's important to note that there isn't a one-size-fits-all rule for dressing babies. The decision to put shoes on a newborn depends on the situation and the baby's needs. In this case, Joy-Anna may have made a conscious choice not to put shoes on Gunner because he was comfortable and not at risk of catching a cold or infection.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>But this incident highlights a common challenge that new moms face â€“ dealing with unsolicited opinions and criticisms from outsiders. It's easy to get overwhelmed by the abundance of information out there about baby care. What works for one baby may not work for another. Every baby is unique and has different needs.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>So how can new moms navigate this? Here are some practical tips:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Trust your instincts. As a mother, you have a natural instinct to protect and care for your child. If something feels off or wrong, listen to that voice inside you. You know your baby better than anyone else.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Seek advice from trusted sources. It's okay to ask for help and advice from family, friends, or medical professionals who have experience with babies. Just be sure to take their advice with a grain of salt and adapt it to your own situation.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Don't compare your baby to others. It's easy to fall into the trap of comparing your baby's development, habits, or appearance to others. But this can lead to unnecessary stress and worry. Remember that every baby is unique and will grow and develop at their own pace.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In the end, being a new mom is a learning experience. You'll make some mistakes along the way, but that's okay. What matters most is that you love and care for your baby to the best of your ability.</p>
