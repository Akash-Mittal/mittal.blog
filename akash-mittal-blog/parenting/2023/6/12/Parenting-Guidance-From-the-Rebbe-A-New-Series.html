  <p>As a mother of four young children, I often find myself seeking guidance on how to navigate the challenges of parenting. I am not alone in this pursuit. In fact, there is a new series from JEM (Jewish Educational Media) that has been released, entitled "Parenting Guidance From the Rebbe." This series offers valuable insight and advice for parents of all ages, based on the teachings of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One story that stood out to me was about a mother who approached the Rebbe seeking advice on how to raise her children. The Rebbe asked her what she did when her children misbehaved, to which she replied that she would scold them or even spank them. The Rebbe then asked her what she did when they did something good. Surprised, the mother replied that she didn't do anything special. The Rebbe then advised her to praise her children when they did something good, and to try to focus on positive reinforcement rather than punishment.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This story highlights a common parenting mistake: focusing too much on discipline and not enough on praise and positive reinforcement. In my own experience, I have found that when I make a point to acknowledge my children's good behavior, it not only encourages them to continue that behavior, but it also strengthens our relationship.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable examples of positive reinforcement might include offering verbal praise, hugs and physical affection, small rewards or treats (such as stickers or extra screen time), or simply taking the time to play with your child and show them that you value their company. These small gestures can go a long way in building a child's self-esteem and sense of worth.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Other advice from the Rebbe includes the importance of instilling a sense of responsibility and independence in your children from a young age. This can be done through giving them age-appropriate chores or tasks, allowing them to make decisions for themselves (within reason), and empowering them to take ownership of their own actions and behaviors.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In addition, the Rebbe emphasized the importance of spending quality time with your children. This means putting down your phone and other distractions and giving your child your full attention. Whether it be reading a book together, going on a walk, or simply engaging in conversation, making time for your child can have a profound impact on their emotional well-being and overall development.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, the series "Parenting Guidance From the Rebbe" offers valuable advice and insight for parents of all ages. By focusing on positive reinforcement, instilling a sense of responsibility and independence, and spending quality time with our children, we can create stronger, healthier relationships with our children and help them to become confident, capable individuals.</p>
