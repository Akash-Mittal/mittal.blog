    <section id="introduction">
     <p>Divorce is never easy, especially when children are involved. Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck were one of the most talked-about couples in Hollywood, with many fans rooting for their happy ending. Despite their split years ago, the two have remained committed to co-parenting their children and working together for their well-being. In a recent interview with Sheryl Lee Ralph, Garner opened up about the "mess of parenting" with an ex-spouse and how it can actually be a gift.</p>
     <blockquote>
      "When you have children with somebody, you're checking in with each other for the rest of your life," Garner said.
     </blockquote>
     <p>Not all co-parenting relationships are as successful as Garner and Affleck's, but the actress's words are a reminder that it is indeed possible to make it work.</p>

     <h2>Finding Common Ground</h2>
     <p>Garner and Ralph spoke at length about their experiences with parenting and co-parenting, and the two women realized they had a lot in common. Both had to navigate complicated relationships with their exes while prioritizing the best interests of their children.</p>
     <blockquote>
      "I know my kids and I are getting the best version of my ex-husband and he's getting the best version of me because that's what our kids need," Garner said.
     </blockquote>
     <p>It can be difficult to put aside any animosity or hurt feelings towards an ex-spouse, but it's important to focus on the bigger picture: your children's well-being. Finding common ground can help to create a more peaceful and positive co-parenting relationship.</p>

    <section id="quantifiable">
     
     <ul>
      <li>According to a study by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, children who had positive relationships with both parents after a divorce had better emotional and behavioral outcomes.</li>
      <li>Children in shared-custody arrangements had fewer behavior problems than those in sole-custody arrangements, according to a study by Linda Nielsen, a professor of adolescent and educational psychology.</li>
      <li>In a survey conducted by the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, 57% of respondents reported an increase in joint custody agreements.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>These quantifiable examples show the benefits of positive co-parenting relationships. Putting the needs of your children first can lead to better outcomes for them, both emotionally and behaviorally.</p>
