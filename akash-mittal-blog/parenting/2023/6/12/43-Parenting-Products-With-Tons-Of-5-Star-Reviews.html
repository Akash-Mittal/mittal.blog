   <li>Consider purchasing products that are versatile and can be used in multiple ways. This can save you money and storage space.</li>

This pillow has over 4,000 5-star reviews on Amazon, and is perfect for keeping my baby comfortable and supported while he naps or lounges.

  <p>Another great product that has helped me as a parent is the OXO Tot Perch Booster Seat. This booster seat has over 900 5-star reviews on Amazon, and is perfect for when we're eating out or at a friend's house. It's compact and easy to transport, and it allows my toddler to sit at the table just like everyone else.</p>
