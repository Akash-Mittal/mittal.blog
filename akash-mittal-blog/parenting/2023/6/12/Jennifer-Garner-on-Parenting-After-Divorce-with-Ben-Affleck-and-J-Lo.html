   <p>Divorce affects not only the couple involved but also their children. It causes emotional stress, financial struggles, and changes in lifestyle. For Hollywood celebrities, divorce is not just a personal matter but also a public spectacle. In the most recent episode of Variety's Actors on Actors series, Jennifer Garner and Sheryl Lee Ralph spoke about their experiences of parenting after divorce.</p>
   <p>Jennifer Garner, known for her roles in Alias, Juno, and Love, Simon, was married to Ben Affleck from 2005 to 2018. The couple has three children together: Violet, Seraphina, and Samuel. Ben Affleck is currently dating Jennifer Lopez, whom he previously dated in the early 2000s.</p>
   <p>When asked about co-parenting with Ben Affleck and J.Lo, Jennifer Garner said, "We have something really beautiful and we have created something that we are all really proud of. We are definitely a modern family. We're doing really well." She went on to say that co-parenting requires "a lot of communication" and "a lot of generosity." It also takes "putting the children first," she added.</p>
   <p>Sheryl Lee Ralph, known for her roles in Dreamgirls, Sister Act 2, and Ray Donovan, shared her own story of co-parenting after divorce. She and her ex-husband have two children, a son and a daughter. She said that co-parenting is "not always easy" but it is "worth it" for the sake of the children. She stressed the importance of "praying and meditating" to stay centered and focused.</p>
   <p>While every divorce and co-parenting situation is different, there are some quantifiable examples of what works and what doesn't in co-parenting after divorce.</p>
   <h2> Co-Parenting After Divorce</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Communication: The more communication there is between co-parents, the better. This includes sharing information about the children's school, activities, health, and well-being. It also means being responsive to each other's messages and requests.</li>
    <li>Flexibility: Co-parenting after divorce requires flexibility in scheduling, parenting styles, and decision-making. It means being willing to compromise and adapt to changes in circumstances.</li>
    <li>Consistency: While flexibility is important, consistency in parenting is also important. Children need stability and predictability in their routines and rules. Co-parents should strive to have consistent expectations and consequences for their children.</li>
    <li>Respect: Co-parents should show respect for each other as parents and as individuals. This includes avoiding negative comments about the other parent in front of the children, and not using the children as messengers or spies.</li>
    <li>Support: Co-parents should support each other in the role of parenting. This means acknowledging and appreciating each other's contributions and being willing to help out in emergencies or unexpected situations.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>These examples are not exhaustive or prescriptive, but they provide some guidelines for successful co-parenting after divorce.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Co-parenting after divorce is possible, but it requires effort, communication, and cooperation.</li>
    <li>Successful co-parenting benefits the children and creates a positive model for future relationships.</li>
    <li>With the right attitude, tools, and support, co-parenting after divorce can be a gift, as Jennifer Garner puts it.</li>
   </ol>
   <p>Personal anecdotes and case studies can further illustrate the challenges and benefits of co-parenting after divorce. Practical tips can also help co-parents navigate through difficult situations and maintain a healthy relationship for the sake of their children.</p>
