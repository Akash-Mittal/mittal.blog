    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>It wasn't until I became a parent that I realized the extent of the trauma I had experienced. As I navigated the challenges of raising a child while battling complex PTSD, I began to understand how it had shaped my life. The everyday experiences of parenting, such as making meals, helping with homework, and dealing with tantrums, triggered memories of past traumas and left me feeling overwhelmed and powerless.</p>
    <p>It wasn't easy to admit to myself and others that I was struggling with PTSD. Even though I had never defined my experiences as traumatic, they had left a deep impact on my mental and emotional well-being. I realized that denying the impact of trauma only made it harder to heal and move forward. As I began to acknowledge and process my trauma, I learned valuable lessons about parenting with PTSD.</p>

    <p>Parenting with complex PTSD can be challenging in many ways. Here are a few quantifiable examples that may help others understand what it's like:</p>
    <ul>
     <li><strong>Frequent flashbacks:</strong> As a parent with PTSD, it's common to experience intense flashbacks triggered by everyday activities. For example, taking your child to the park may remind you of a traumatic event that happened in a similar setting.</li>
     <li><strong>Inability to cope:</strong> Parenting can be chaotic and stressful, even for those without PTSD. However, for someone with complex PTSD, the inability to regulate emotions and cope with stress can make parenting feel insurmountable.</li>
     <li><strong>Dissociation:</strong> It's common for those with PTSD to feel disconnected from reality or dissociated from their surroundings. This can make it difficult to engage with your child and be present in the moment.</li>
    </ul>
