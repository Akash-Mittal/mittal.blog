   <h2>Mixed Messages Around Formula Milk Are a Minefield for Mums</h2>

  <main>
   <section>
    <p>As a new parent, I found myself overwhelmed by the conflicting advice, opinions, and marketing messages regarding formula milk. On one hand, experts and healthcare providers stressed the importance of breastfeeding and the superiority of breastmilk. On the other hand, formula brands promised convenience, accessibility, and nutrition that could rival or even surpass breastmilk. Somewhere in the middle, I was trying to navigate my own unique circumstances, preferences, and resources.</p>
    <p>But for many parents, the choice of whether or not to use formula is not just a matter of personal preference or ideology. It's a matter of survival, security, and well-being. When access to breastmilk is limited or impossible, formula can be a lifesaver for babies and families. However, the cost and availability of formula can also be a source of stress, shame, and desperation for parents who cannot afford or find enough for their children.</p>
    <p>This became painfully clear to me when I read about the recent rise in milk theft from supermarkets and pharmacies in the UK and other countries. These incidents involve parents who steal tins of formula milk from stores, either for themselves or to sell on the black market, due to financial and social pressures. Some of them risk getting caught, fined, banned, or even jailed, while others resort to diluting or adulterating the formula, which can have severe health consequences for babies.</p>

    <h3>The Formula for Change</h3>
    <p>It's clear that the status quo regarding formula milk is not sustainable or equitable. Parents shouldn't have to steal or gamble with their babies' health to get the nutrition they need. Yet simply telling them to breastfeed or shaming them for using formula is not a helpful or compassionate solution. What we need is a new formula for supporting families, respecting their choices, and ensuring their access to safe and affordable baby milk.</p>
    <h4>Here are three key elements that could be part of this new approach:</h4>
    <ol>
     <li><strong>Food security:</strong> Governments, NGOs, and businesses can work together to ensure that formula milk is treated as a basic necessity, not a luxury or a profit-making product. This could involve subsidies, discounts, donations, or other forms of support for parents who cannot afford formula, as well as measures to prevent hoarding, wastage, or theft.</li>
     <li><strong>Evidence-based information:</strong> Healthcare providers, educators, and media should provide accurate, relevant, and non-judgmental information about infant nutrition that reflects the diversity of families and their needs. This could include debunking myths and misconceptions about breastfeeding and formula feeding, addressing common concerns and questions, and highlighting the risks and benefits of different options.</li>
     <li><strong>Parental empowerment:</strong> Parents should have the right and the resources to make informed choices about how to feed their babies, based on their own values, goals, and circumstances. This could involve providing emotional and practical support for breastfeeding, recognizing and respecting the reasons for using formula, and offering counseling and assistance for resolving any difficulties or challenges related to feeding.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Role Models and Resources</h3>
    <p>As an advocate for maternal and child health, I have seen firsthand the positive impact of empowering, educating, and supporting parents on their feeding journeys. One of the most effective ways to do this is through personal stories and examples of other parents who have faced similar challenges and found solutions that worked for them.</p>
    <p>For example, I recently interviewed a mother who struggled with breastfeeding due to medical issues and lack of support, but was able to find a formula that suited her baby's needs and her own values. She shared her experience on social media and received an outpouring of support and gratitude from other parents who felt validated and encouraged.</p>
    <p>I also recommend resources such as lactation consultants, community groups, online forums, and helplines that can provide guidance, reassurance, and connections to other parents and experts. By creating a culture of sharing, listening, and empathy, we can break down the barriers and biases that prevent parents from accessing the help and information they need.</p>

    <h3>The Cost of Inaction</h3>
    <p>The issue of formula milk is not just a matter of personal choice or preference. It's a matter of social justice, public health, and human rights. When parents are forced to steal or compromise on their babies' nutrition due to poverty, stigma, or lack of support, we are failing them and their children. When the media portrays formula feeding as inferior or shameful, we are perpetuating harmful myths and stereotypes that harm families and communities. When governments and businesses prioritize profit over people's basic needs, we are perpetuating systemic inequality and injustice.</p>
    <p>It's time to break the silence and the shame around formula milk and start a more nuanced and inclusive conversation that takes into account the complex factors that shape parents' feeding decisions. It's time to invest in the health and well-being of all babies, regardless of how they are fed. It's time to create a new formula that works for all families.</p>
