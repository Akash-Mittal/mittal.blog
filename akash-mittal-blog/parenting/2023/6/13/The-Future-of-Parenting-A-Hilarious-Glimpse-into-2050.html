    <p>It was a hot summer day in the year 2050, and little Timmy was playing with his virtual reality headset. He was experiencing what it was like to swim with dolphins in the Great Barrier Reef when his mother walked in with her smartwatch connected to her brain implant.</p>
    <p>"Timmy, it's time for your daily dose of education. Put on your neural headset and get ready for your lesson on quantum mechanics," she said before leaving the room.</p>
    <p>Timmy sighed. He didn't like physics at all. He preferred playing video games and exploring virtual worlds. But his mother insisted that he learn everything there is to know about science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) if he wants to have a successful career in the future.</p>
    <p>As he put on his headset, he couldn't help but wonder what it would be like to have a traditional childhood, playing outside with friends without worrying about grades or exams.</p>
