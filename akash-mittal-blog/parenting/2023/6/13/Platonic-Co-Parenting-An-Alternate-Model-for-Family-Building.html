     <p>When 32-year-old Mary decided she wanted to have a baby, she knew that finding a partner with whom she could raise a child was unlikely. As a single woman, Mary was not ready to give up on her dream of having a family. So, she turned to platonic co-parenting.</p>
     <p>Platonic co-parenting is a growing trend where people come together to raise children platonically. This means partnering with friends, known donors or finding elective co-parenting connections on so-called mating sites. Proponents of platonic co-parenting say it offers a sense of security, support, and shared responsibility that can be absent in traditional parenting arrangements.</p>
     <h2>The Numbers Speak for Themselves</h2>
     <p>The numbers are telling. According to surveys, millennials - who now make up the bulk of parenting age ranges - are increasingly valuing platonic and â€˜chosen family' over traditional biological kinship. Studies indicate that up to 30% of LGBTQ millennial couples with children have opted for a platonic co-parenting arrangement.</p>
     <p>Moreover, a 2015 survey from the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers (AAML) found that more than 60% of family law attorneys have seen an increase in negotiated co-parenting agreements over the last five years. And, it's primarily millennials driving this change in the co-parenting landscape.</p>
     <h2>Benefits of Platonic Co-Parenting</h2>
     <p>Platonic co-parenting offers many benefits. For one, it allows single people and same-sex couples to form a unique family without relying on marriage or traditional biological kinship. This type of family building offers a sense of security, support, and shared responsibility that can be absent in traditional parenting arrangements. The child will have two or more parental figures with whom they will share an equal role with each parent in the upbringing of the child.</p>
     <p>The emotional benefits of platonic parenting cannot be underestimated either. Many co-parents choose to be involved in each other's lives outside of parenting responsibilities. This creates a strong support system and builds a sense of togetherness that can benefit the child.</p>
     <h2>Challenges of Platonic Co-Parenting</h2>
     <p>Although platonic co-parenting offers many benefits, it is not without its challenges. One concern is the potential for romantic feelings to develop between co-parents. This can create tension and negatively affect the parenting arrangement, which can lead to custody disputes. It is essential to establish clear boundaries and address potential concerns upfront.</p>
     <p>Another challenge is ensuring both parents have an equal role in the kid's upbringing. This could include things like education, religion, or medical decisions. Open and honest communication is key to ensuring everyone is on the same page.</p>
     <h2>Conclusion</h2>
     <p>Platonic co-parenting is an alternate model for family building that can offer a sense of security, support, and shared responsibility that can be absent in traditional parenting arrangements. The increase in negotiated co-parenting agreements over recent years indicates that this new family-building trend is here to stay. However, it is essential to establish clear boundaries, open and honest communication, and keep the child's well-being in mind when pursuing a platonic co-parenting arrangement.</p>
