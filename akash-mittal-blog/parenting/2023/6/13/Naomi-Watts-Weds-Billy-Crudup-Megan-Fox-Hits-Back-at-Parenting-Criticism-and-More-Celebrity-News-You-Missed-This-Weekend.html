  <p>The couple met on the set of the Netflix series Gypsy, which they both starred in. At the time, Watts was still married to her ex-husband, Liev Schreiber. However, after their split, she and Crudup started dating.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The wedding took place in New York City, where the couple lives with their children. They've been very private about their relationship, so it's no surprise that they kept their wedding under wraps. Congratulations to the happy couple!</p>
