    <p>It was a beautiful summer day, and Jennifer Garner and her two daughters, Violet and Seraphina, were having a picnic in the park. Suddenly, her ex-husband, Ben Affleck, appeared out of nowhere, and joined them for lunch. The three of them chatted and laughed like old friends, while the girls played happily around them. For a moment, the scene could have been mistaken for a happy family outing. But the truth was, they were a divorced couple, who, despite their differences, were committed to co-parenting their children.</p>
    <p>Jennifer and Ben's amicable co-parenting arrangement was not a one-time coincidence, but a deliberate effort on both their parts. In an interview with <em>Good Morning America</em>, Jennifer talked about how they prioritize their children's well-being over their personal feelings. "We're definitely a modern family," she said. "We're doing really well."</p>

    <h2> Successful Co-Parenting</h2>
    <p>Jennifer and Ben are not the only celebrity couple who have successfully navigated the challenges of co-parenting after divorce. Here are a few examples of other famous ex-couples who have done it right:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow - Despite "conscious uncoupling" in 2014, they have remained close friends and co-parents to their two children, Apple and Moses. They even go on vacation together as a family.</li>
     <li>Amy Poehler and Will Arnett - After divorcing in 2012, they have co-parented their two sons, Archie and Abel, with mutual respect and support. They attend school events and birthday parties together, and often share joint custody.</li>
     <li>Heidi Klum and Seal - Despite their acrimonious divorce in 2012, they have continued to co-parent their four children, and even go on family vacations together. They also have a "no bad-mouthing" rule about each other.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These examples demonstrate that co-parenting with an ex is not only possible, but can also be beneficial for children's emotional well-being. Studies have shown that children who have positive relationships with both parents after divorce have better mental health outcomes and higher self-esteem than those who don't.</p>
