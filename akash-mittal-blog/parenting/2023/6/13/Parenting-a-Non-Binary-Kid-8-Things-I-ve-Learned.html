  <p>When our child was born, we assigned them a gender based on their genitalia. We didn't think twice about it; after all, that's what everyone else did. But as our child grew older, they began to display characteristics and preferences that didn't align with what we had assumed about their gender.</p>
  <p>It wasn't until our child came out as non-binary that we realized the limitations of the gender binary and the importance of allowing our child to express themselves in whatever way feels right to them.</p>
  <p>Here are eight things I've learned as the parent of a non-binary child:</p>
  <h2>1. Gender expression is a spectrum</h2>
  <p>When most people think of gender, they think of the binary categories of male and female. But gender isn't that simple. It's a spectrum with infinite variations and nuances. Our child's current gender expression may not align with society's expectations for their assigned sex, but that doesn't mean it's wrong or abnormal.</p>
  <p>For example, our child was assigned female at birth but doesn't identify as a girl. They often present in a more masculine way, wearing clothes traditionally associated with boys and requesting a short haircut. However, they also enjoy wearing dresses and makeup on occasion. Their gender expression is fluid and can change from day to day.</p>
  <p>It's important to allow our children to explore their gender expression without judgment or restrictions. We should encourage them to dress and act in a way that feels authentic to them, regardless of gender norms.</p>
  <h2>2. Language matters</h2>
  <p>The language we use to describe our children's gender can have a big impact on their self-esteem and sense of identity. Referring to our child as "she" or "her" doesn't accurately reflect who they are, and can make them feel invalidated or invisible.</p>
  <p>Instead, we use gender-neutral pronouns like "they" and "them" to refer to our child. It takes some getting used to, but it's a small price to pay for making our child feel seen and heard.</p>
  <p>It's also important to avoid using gendered language in general. Instead of saying "boys and girls," we can say "kids" or "children." Instead of saying "ladies and gentlemen," we can say "folks" or "friends."</p>
  <h2>3. Other people's reactions can be hurtful</h2>
  <p>While we've been fortunate to have a supportive community of friends and family, not everyone has been accepting of our child's gender identity. Some people are confused or dismissive, while others are outright hostile.</p>
  <p>It's important to prepare our children for the possibility of negative reactions and arm them with coping strategies. We can practice responding to common questions and comments like, "But you were born a girl!" or "How do you know you're not just confused?"</p>
  <p>We can also encourage our children to seek out like-minded individuals and communities for support. There are plenty of resources available for parents of non-binary kids, including online forums and support groups.</p>
  <h2>4. Representation matters</h2>
  <p>Representation in media and pop culture has a significant impact on how we view ourselves and others. When our child was younger, we struggled to find books and TV shows that featured non-binary characters or talked about gender identity in an age-appropriate way.</p>
  <p>Thankfully, there are more and more resources available now for non-binary kids and their families. Books like "They, She, He, Me: Free to Be!" by Maya Christina Gonzalez and "Neither" by Airlie Anderson feature non-binary characters and explore gender identity in a compassionate and accessible way.</p>
  <p>TV shows like "Steven Universe" and "She-Ra and the Princesses of Power" also feature non-binary or gender-nonconforming characters, providing positive representation for kids who don't fit neatly into the male/female binary.</p>
  <h2>5. It's okay to make mistakes</h2>
  <p>As with any aspect of parenting, we're going to make mistakes when it comes to supporting our non-binary child. We may accidentally use the wrong pronoun or make assumptions about their gender expression that don't align with their current feelings.</p>
  <p>It's important to apologize and correct ourselves when we make mistakes, but also to not beat ourselves up over them. We're human, and we're learning right alongside our children.</p>
  <h2>6. Seeking professional support can be helpful</h2>
  <p>Parenting a non-binary child can be challenging, and it's okay to seek professional support. A gender-affirming therapist can help our child navigate their feelings of gender dysphoria and provide them with coping strategies for dealing with negative reactions from others.</p>
  <p>Therapy can also be helpful for us as parents, as we navigate our own feelings of confusion, guilt, or fear. We may also need support in advocating for our child's needs at school or in medical settings.</p>
  <h2>7. Our child's safety is our top priority</h2>
  <p>As much as we strive to create a safe and accepting environment for our non-binary child, the reality is that there are still many people who are hostile to gender diversity. Transgender and non-binary people are at increased risk of violence, discrimination, and harassment.</p>
  <p>As parents, our top priority is our child's safety. We need to be mindful of the risks and take steps to protect our child. This might mean advocating for their rights at school or in medical settings, supporting them in choosing gender-affirming clothing and hairstyles, or even relocating to a more accepting community.</p>
  <h2>8. Our child is perfect just the way they are</h2>
  <p>At the end of the day, our child is perfect just the way they are. Their gender identity and expression may not be what we expected or what society deems "normal," but that doesn't make it any less valid or beautiful.</p>
  <p>We love our child exactly as they are, and we're grateful to have the opportunity to learn and grow alongside them.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Parenting a non-binary child can be challenging, but it's also incredibly rewarding. Here are three key takeaways from my experience:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Gender is a spectrum, and our child's gender expression may not align with traditional expectations.</li>
   <li>The language we use to describe our child's gender can have a big impact on their self-esteem and sense of identity.</li>
   <li>Representation in media and pop culture matters, and can help our child feel seen and accepted.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>At the end of the day, our goal as parents is to support our child in being their authentic selves and to advocate for their safety and well-being.</p>
