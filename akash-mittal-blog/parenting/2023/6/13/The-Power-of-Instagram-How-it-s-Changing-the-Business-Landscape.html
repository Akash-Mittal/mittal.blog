   <h2>An Eye-Opening Story</h2>

  <main>
   <p>When Taylor Swift released her album, "Folklore," in July 2020, fans were eager to purchase physical copies – CDs and vinyls – of the album. However, given the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, Swift was unable to do a traditional album release and meet-and-greet events.</p>
   <p>Instead, she turned to Instagram. She uploaded photos of herself with the physical copies of "Folklore," complete with a hand-written note and drawing on each one. In the caption, she announced that a select number of copies were available for purchase. Fans rushed to buy them, and the inventory sold out within hours. Swift had turned to Instagram, and it turned out to be the ultimate marketing tool that helped her share her album with the world.</p>
   <p>This story might seem like an isolated incident, but it highlights the power of Instagram. Almost everyone is following someone or something on Instagram, and it's no surprise that businesses have taken notice.</p>
   <h3>Quantifiable Examples</h3>
   <p>Let's take a look at some quantifiable examples of how Instagram has impacted businesses:</p>
