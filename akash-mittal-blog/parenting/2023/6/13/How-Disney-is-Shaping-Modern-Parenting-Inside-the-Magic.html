    <p>Once upon a time, parents would turn to books and experts for advice on raising their children. However, in recent years, more and more parents have turned to a rather unlikely source for guidance â€“ Disney movies. Young families are finding moral virtues in films like 'Frozen', 'Coco', and 'Moana', and are using these stories to shape their parenting techniques.</p>
    <p>Parents appreciate the values portrayed in these movies and feel that Disney movies possess an innate ability to influence their children's behavior positively. Many argue that Disney movies are a persuasive medium as they can subtly suggest morals and values without the child even realizing that they are being taught.</p>
    <p>Disney movies are unique in their representation of families. Fathers and mothers are portrayed in more realistic depictions than ever before. These family units have their problems and are far removed from the perfect nuclear family of the past. Instead, it is normal for the father to be absent or for the mother to manage and support the family. These new realities help parents to address varied family situations and provide moral guidance on how to cope.</p><a name="examples"></a>
    
    <p>According to a recent survey on parenting, 65% of parents with young children consider Disney media to be a useful parenting aid. This data shows that there is an increase in reliance on Disney media for parenting advice in recent years. These movies have become a means for teaching morals, values, and life lessons that are important to many parents. Furthermore, parents are even more likely to use Disney movies to initiate discussions with their children about topics concerning kindness, acceptance, empathy, and self-awareness.</p>
    <p>A number of families have turned to parenting bloggers who specialize in Disney parenting, like Leslie Harvey, the founder of 'Trips with Tykes'. Harvey believes that there are many lessons to be learned from Disney movies when it comes to parenting. She frequently writes articles on the subject and has claimed that Disney movies are great conversation starters with her children. She often uses movies like 'Finding Nemo' and 'The Lion King' to teach her children about the importance of family, perseverance, and overcoming adversity.</p><a name="conclusion"></a>
