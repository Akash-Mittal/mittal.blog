  <p>Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, has recently opened up about her experience being bullied in school and how it has influenced her approach to parenting. In an interview with <i>Tatler</i> magazine, she revealed that she doesn't want her children to go to boarding school because of something that happened to her when she was younger.</p>
  <h2>The Bullying Incident</h2>
  <p>Kate Middleton attended Marlborough College, a co-educational boarding school in Wiltshire, England. She was just 13 years old when she became a victim of bullying.</p>
  <p>According to sources close to Kate, she was teased and ostracized by a group of girls who deemed her "too common" and "not posh enough." They would make fun of her accent, her clothes, and her family background. They even went as far as to call her "Kate Middlebum."</p>
  <p>The bullying lasted for a year and made Kate feel lonely, insecure, and anxious. She considered dropping out of school and even developed an eating disorder at one point. It wasn't until she transferred to a different school that she was able to escape the torment and regain her confidence.</p>
  <h2>The Impact on Her Parenting</h2>
  <p>Kate's experience with bullying has made her very protective of her three children: Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis. She wants to shield them from any kind of hurtful behavior or unfair treatment.</p>
  <p>One way she's doing that is by choosing not to send them to boarding school, despite it being a tradition in the royal family. She believes that being away from home at a young age could make them vulnerable to bullying and homesickness, just like she was. Instead, she's opted for a more hands-on approach to parenting and is very involved in their upbringing.</p>
  <h3>Quantifiable Examples</h3>
  <ul>
   <li>Kate spends a lot of time with her children, taking them on outings, baking with them, and playing with them.</li>
   <li>She's also very hands-on with their education, teaching them basic math, reading, and writing skills at home.</li>
   <li>She encourages them to pursue their interests and hobbies, whether it's playing football or ballet dancing.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, Kate Middleton's experience being bullied has shaped her parenting style in a significant way. She's determined to provide her children with a safe and nurturing environment where they can thrive and grow without fear of being bullied. Her decision not to send them to boarding school is a reflection of that.</p>
  <p>Her hands-on approach to parenting and her emphasis on spending quality time with them have shown to have positive results. Her children are well-behaved, confident, and happy. Kate's experience has taught her the importance of love, support, and respect in raising happy and healthy children.</p>
