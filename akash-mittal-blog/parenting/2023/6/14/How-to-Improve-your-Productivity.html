    <p>According to a study conducted by the Harvard Business Review, workers who take breaks every 90 minutes report a 30% higher level of focus compared to those who take no breaks or only take breaks less frequently. Another study by the University of Illinois found that the average person loses about 25 minutes per day due to distractions. That adds up to more than six full days per year!</p>

    <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
    <h3>1. Use the Pomodoro Technique</h3>
    <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management technique that involves working in focused intervals of 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break. After four cycles, you take a longer break of around 15-30 minutes. This technique helps you stay focused on your work and gives you the opportunity to take regular breaks to recharge.</p>
    <h3>2. Eliminate Distractions</h3>
    <p>Distractions are the enemy of productivity. To eliminate distractions, turn off your phone notifications, close unnecessary tabs on your computer, and use noise-cancelling headphones to block out background noise. You can also use apps like Freedom or Cold Turkey to block access to certain websites or apps during work hours.</p>
    <h3>3. Plan Your Day</h3>
    <p>At the beginning of each day, create a to-do list of tasks that need to be completed. Prioritize the most important tasks and schedule them for the time of day when you are most productive. This will ensure that you are making progress on the most important tasks and not getting sidetracked by less important tasks.</p>
