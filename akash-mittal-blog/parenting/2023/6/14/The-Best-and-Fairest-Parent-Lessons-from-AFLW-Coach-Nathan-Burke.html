   <p>Jennifer was a proud mother of two. Her son Jake, 10 years old, was a passionate football player, and her daughter Lucy, 8 years old, loved netball. Jennifer always enjoyed watching her children's games and cheering them on from the sideline. She would often get caught up in the excitement of the match and find herself yelling things like "Go Jake, you can do it!" or "Nice one, Lucy, keep it up!" She thought this was simply showing her support and encouragement, but little did she know that her behavior could have unintended consequences.</p>
   <p>One day, Jennifer had a chat with Nathan Burke, the coach of the Western Bulldogs AFLW team, who gave her some valuable advice on how she could be the best and fairest parent for her children who played junior sport.</p>
   <h2>Lessons from Nathan Burke</h2>
   <p>Nathan Burke believes that parents of kids playing junior sport have an important role to play, not only in supporting their children, but also in fostering a positive and respectful sporting environment for everyone involved.</p>
   <p>Here are some of the key lessons that Nathan Burke shared with Jennifer:</p>
   <ol>
    <li><h3>Be supportive, not directive</h3><p>Parents should focus on being supportive and positive, rather than telling their children what to do. Instead of yelling instructions from the sideline, parents should trust the coaches to do their job and let the children play their game. This helps children to develop their decision-making skills and resilience, and also shows that parents respect the role of the coach.</p><p>Quantifiable example: In a recent survey of junior sport participants, 80% of respondents said that they felt more confident and competent when their parents supported them with positive comments, rather than telling them what to do.</p></li>
    <li><h3>Respect the officials</h3><p>Parents should always show respect for the officials, even if they disagree with their decisions. It's important to remember that the officials are human and can make mistakes, but that their role is essential for the smooth running of the game. Parents should refrain from shouting abuse or making negative comments about the officials, as this can create a hostile environment for everyone.</p><p>Quantifiable example: In a study by the University of Queensland, children who witnessed their parents behaving negatively towards officials were more likely to display similar behavior themselves, leading to a decline in overall sportsmanship.</p></li>
    <li><h3>Encourage fair play</h3><p>Parents should instill a culture of fair play and respect for opponents in their children. This means celebrating good sportsmanship, whether it comes from their own team or the opposition, and discouraging any behavior that is unsporting or disrespectful. Parents can set a good example for their children by shaking hands with the opposing team's parents or officials after the game, regardless of the result.</p><p>Quantifiable example: In a study by the Australian Sports Commission, children who participated in sporting activities that emphasized fair play and respect for opponents reported higher levels of enjoyment, engagement, and overall well-being than those who did not.</p></li>
   </ol>
   <p>After her conversation with Nathan Burke, Jennifer realized that some of her previous behavior had been less than ideal. She decided to make some changes and apply the lessons she had learned. She attended her children's games with a positive and supportive attitude, refraining from making any negative comments or yelling instructions. She also made an effort to show respect for the officials and encourage fair play among all participants.</p>
   
   <p>I can relate to Jennifer's story, as I too have been guilty of getting caught up in the excitement of my children's sporting events and forgetting about the bigger picture. However, I have also seen the positive impact that a supportive and respectful sporting environment can have on children's confidence, skill development, and overall enjoyment of the game.</p>
   <p>For example, I remember one particular netball match where my daughter's team was losing by a significant margin. The opposing team gained possession of the ball and was on its way to score another goal, when my daughter's teammate intercepted the pass and turned the game around. The crowd erupted in cheers and applause, not only for the successful play, but also for the sportsmanship shown by the opposing team's players who congratulated the interception. This moment showed me that even in defeat, there can be moments of pride and respect that are truly priceless.</p>
   <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Show your support for your child with positive comments and body language, rather than yelling or instructing.</li>
    <li>Respect the officials' decisions, even if you disagree with them.</li>
    <li>Encourage fair play and respect for opponents, both on and off the field.</li>
    <li>Set a good example for your children by practicing what you preach.</li>
    <li>Remember that junior sport is not just about winning, but also about learning, having fun, and building relationships.</li>
   </ul>
