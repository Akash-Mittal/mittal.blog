  <p>Being a mom is arguably one of the toughest jobs in the world. It requires a significant amount of time, energy, and emotional strength. We all want to be the best moms we can be, but societal pressure to be "perfect" often leaves us feeling stressed and inadequate. As a mom of two young children, I have come to realize that falling short of the ridiculous standards set for motherhood can actually be a gift to other parents.</p>
  <h2>The Gift of Imperfection</h2>
  <p>Last weekend, I took my kids to the park and ran into another mom who I had not seen in a while. As we chatted, she said to me, "You always seem so put together, like you have it all figured out." I laughed out loud. The truth is, I do not have it all figured out. I struggle with the same things that many moms do: juggling work, family, and personal time. Struggling in front of other moms can be uncomfortable, but it can also be a gift.</p>
  <h3>An Example of the Gift</h3>
  <p>A few weeks ago, I was at a playdate with a group of moms and their young children. One of the moms had just returned to work after having her second child. As she talked about how difficult it was for her to leave her baby at home, tears streamed down her face. Initially, I felt uncomfortable and unsure of how to handle the situation. But then, I decided to share my own experience of returning to work after having my second child. I told her about the internal struggle I felt leaving my baby at home, but also shared how I found ways to make the transition easier. By being vulnerable and sharing my own struggles, I was able to offer support and encouragement to another mom who was going through the same thing.</p>
  <h2> Ridiculous Standards for Motherhood</h2>
  <p>Social media has played a significant role in raising the bar for motherhood. We are bombarded with images of moms who seem to have it all together, with perfectly dressed and smiling children, gourmet meals, and perfectly organized homes. Here are a few examples of unrealistic expectations set for mothers:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Mom-shaming on social media</li>
   <li>Expectations of a perfect home and meals</li>
   <li>Expectations of an ideal body type</li>
   <li>Expectations of meeting every milestone on time</li>
   <li>Expectations of having perfectly behaved children all the time</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>A Personal Example</h3>
  <p>When I was pregnant with my second child, I realized that I was not going to be able to keep up with the same level of cleanliness and organization as I had before. I decided to hire a cleaning service to come once a week to help me keep my home in order. For some reason, I felt embarrassed to tell other moms about this. I did not want to seem like I was not capable of managing everything on my own. A few months later, a friend confided in me that she had done the same thing, but had not told anyone because she was afraid of being judged. By sharing my own experience, I was able to offer support and validation to someone who was struggling with the same thing as me.</p>
  <h2>The Gift of Lowering the Standards</h2>
  <p>Lowering the ridiculous standards for motherhood has to start somewhere. Why not start with ourselves? Here are three ways that we can give the gift of lower standards to other moms:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Be vulnerable and share our struggles with other moms. By doing so, we open up the opportunity for connection and support.</li>
   <li>Be accepting and non-judgmental of other moms' choices. Every mom has their own unique set of circumstances and should not be judged for the choices they make.</li>
   <li>Encourage other moms to take care of themselves. We cannot take care of our children if we are not taking care of ourselves first.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>A Practical Tip</h3>
  <p>If you are struggling with something, reach out to a friend or family member who you can trust to support you. Sometimes just talking about our challenges can help us feel better.</p>
  <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Motherhood is tough, there is no doubt about it. But we can make it easier on ourselves and others by lowering the ridiculous standards that have been set for us. By being vulnerable and sharing our struggles, we offer a gift of connection and support to other moms. By being accepting and non-judgmental of other moms' choices, we create a community of support and respect. And by encouraging other moms to take care of themselves, we create a generation of healthier and happier moms.</p>
