  <p>Kelly Clarkson has opened up about her experiences as a mother on Glennon Doyle's "We Can Do Hard Things" podcast. She shared how going through a divorce made her realize that she is a better mother than she thought. In this article, we'll delve into the singer's thoughts on parenting and see what we can learn from her experiences.</p>
  <h2>Parenting After Divorce</h2>
  <p>Clarkson admitted that she was initially worried about how her divorce from Brandon Blackstock would affect her children. However, she realized that they were happier and better off with separated parents than they were with two unhappy parents who argued constantly.</p>
  <p>"I'm so glad that my kids have a happy mom," Clarkson said. "Divorce is never easy, but sometimes it's necessary for the well-being of everyone involved."</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Nearly 50% of American marriages end in divorce, affecting millions of families.</li>
   <li>Divorce can be difficult for children, but it's not the end of the world.</li>
   <li>Parents can still be good role models even if they're not together.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Being a Good Role Model</h2>
  <p>Clarkson believes that being a good role model is essential for parents. She tries to lead by example, showing her children how to be kind, respectful, and confident. She encourages them to pursue their dreams and to never give up, no matter how difficult life may seem.</p>
  <p>"I want my kids to know that they can do anything they set their minds to," Clarkson said. "I also want them to know that it's okay to fail sometimes. That's how we learn and grow."</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Children learn by example, so it's important for parents to set a good one.</li>
   <li>Encourage your children to be confident, kind, and respectful.</li>
   <li>Teach them to pursue their dreams and to never give up.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>The Importance of Self-Care</h2>
  <p>As a busy mom and musician, Clarkson knows the importance of taking care of herself. She tries to make time for exercise, meditation, and other self-care activities. She also encourages her fans to take care of themselves, both physically and mentally.</p>
  <p>"It's so important to take care of yourself," Clarkson said. "When you're happy and healthy, you can be a better parent, partner, and friend."</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Self-care is not selfish; it's essential for mental and physical well-being.</li>
