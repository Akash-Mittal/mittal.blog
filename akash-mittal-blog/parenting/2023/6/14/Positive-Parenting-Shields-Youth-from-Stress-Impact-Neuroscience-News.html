    <h2> Positive Parenting Impact</h2>
    <p>A research study conducted by the University of California, San Francisco, found that children who were exposed to positive parenting techniques like affection, praise, and guidance had lower stress hormones in their bodies. The study also found that these children were better equipped to handle stressful situations and had a more positive outlook on life.</p>
    <p>Another study published in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry found that teenagers who reported positive relationships with their parents had lower cortisol levels. Cortisol is a hormone that increases during stress and can have a negative impact on physical and mental health in the long term.</p>
    <p>These examples demonstrate that positive parenting can have a quantifiable impact on young individuals' stress levels and mental health.</p>
