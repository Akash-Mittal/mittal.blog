   <p>Sue Radford is a British mother who gained fame for having 22 children. She and her husband, Noel, have been married for over 25 years and have raised their kids on a budget, while sharing their lives on social media. Recently, Sue took to Instagram to share the reality of being a mum of 22, most of which spent the entire weekend in their pool. She said, "Can you tell that we spent the entire weekend in the pool? I've just done five loads of washing, and the pool still needs cleaning. Being a mum is non-stop!"</p>
   <h2>The Struggle is Real: Parenting 22 Kids</h2>
   <p>While some may admire Sue for her large family, others may wonder how she manages to handle the responsibility of parenting so many children. The truth is that parenting even one child is challenging, so parenting 22 can be overwhelming. Sue has mentioned in interviews that budgeting, meal planning, and keeping the home organized are some of the biggest struggles she faces. When you have 22 kids to feed, clothe, and entertain, these tasks can take a lot of effort and time.</p>
   <h2>The Numbers Game</h2>
   <p>Let's break down some of the numbers involved in raising 22 kids. According to research, the average cost of raising one child to the age of 18 is $233,610. This means that Sue and Noel could have spent over $5 million on their family so far. Of course, they have been able to save money by shopping at thrift stores, cooking from scratch, and using hand-me-downs. Nevertheless, they still have to fork out a lot of money for groceries, utilities, and other expenses.</p>
   <p>Another quantifiable example is the amount of time Sue spends doing laundry. If each child has five outfits, that's 110 outfits to wash every week. If it takes an average of 45 minutes to do one load of laundry, that's 8 hours and 15 minutes of washing time alone. And that's not even counting folding and putting away clothes. It's no wonder Sue jokes that she is constantly doing laundry!</p>
   <h2>The Reality of Being a Mum of 22</h2>
   <p>Despite the challenges, Sue insists that she wouldn't have it any other way. She loves being a mum and cherishes the moments she spends with her children. She has said that her children are her biggest accomplishment and that nothing else compares to the joy they bring her. Sue also makes sure to take care of herself and her relationship with Noel. She and Noel make time for date nights and try to have some alone time whenever possible.</p>
