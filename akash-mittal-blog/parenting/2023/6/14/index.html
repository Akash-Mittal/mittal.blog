<p>Sue Radford is a British mother who gained fame for having 22 children. She and her husband, Noel, have been married for over 25 years and have raised their kids on a budget, while sharing their lives on social media. Recently, Sue took to Instagram to share the reality of being a mum of 22, most of which spent the entire weekend in their pool. She said, "Can you tell that we spent the entire weekend in the pool? I've just done five loads of washing, and the pool still needs cleaning. Being a mum is non-stop!"
While some may admire Sue for her large family, others may wonder how she manages to handle the responsibility of parenting so many children. The truth is that parenting even one child is challenging, so parenting 22 can be overwhelming. Sue has mentioned in interviews that budgeting, meal planning, and keeping the home organized are some of the biggest struggles she faces. When you have 22 kids to feed, clothe, and entertain, these tasks can take a lot of effort and time.
Let's break down some of the numbers involved in raising 22 kids. According to research, the average cost of raising one child to the age of 18 is $233,610. This means that Sue and Noel could have spent over $5 million on their family so far. Of course, they have been able to save money by shopping at thrift stores, cooking from scratch, and using hand-me-downs. Nevertheless, they still have to fork out a lot of money for groceries, utilities, and other expenses.
Another quantifiable example is the amount of time Sue spends doing laundry. If each child has five outfits, that's 110 outfits to wash every week. If it takes an average of 45 minutes to do one load of laundry, that's 8 hours and 15 minutes of washing time alone. And that's not even counting folding and putting away clothes. It's no wonder Sue jokes that she is constantly doing laundry!
Despite the challenges, Sue insists that she wouldn't have it any other way. She loves being a mum and cherishes the moments she spends with her children. She has said that her children are her biggest accomplishment and that nothing else compares to the joy they bring her. Sue also makes sure to take care of herself and her relationship with Noel. She and Noel make time for date nights and try to have some alone time whenever possible.</p>

<p>How these two moms found a way to make blended families work
It's not every day that you hear about two ex-wives of the same man becoming friends and co-parents, but Jennifer Lopez and Jennifer Garner managed to do just that. Their relationship began when Garner was married to Ben Affleck, who later dated and got engaged to Lopez in 2002. However, when Affleck and Lopez's relationship ended in 2004, Garner was there to support him during a difficult time.
Fast forward a few years later, Affleck and Garner got divorced in 2018 after a decade of marriage, but they remained committed to co-parenting their three children. It was during this time that Lopez and Affleck reconnected and started dating again. As a result, Lopez and Garner's paths were bound to cross, and it didn't take long for them to realize that they had a lot in common.
The two women bonded over their shared experiences of raising children, managing busy careers, and navigating the challenges of blended families. They found that they could lean on each other for support and advice, and that their children could benefit from having more positive role models in their lives. Today, Lopez and Garner are close friends who even take family vacations together.
One of the most remarkable things about Lopez and Garner's co-parenting relationship is how well they manage to put their children's needs first. Despite the complicated dynamics of having step-siblings and co-parenting with an ex-spouse's new partner, they have found a way to make it work.
For example, when Lopez's twins Max and Emme were celebrating their birthday last year, Garner was there to help them blow out the candles. And when Garner's son Samuel had a karate tournament, Lopez was there to cheer him on. They make a point of attending each other's children's events and creating a sense of unity among their blended family.
Lopez and Garner also communicate regularly about their children's schedules and needs. They coordinate drop-offs and pickups, share information about school and extracurricular activities, and make sure that everyone is on the same page when it comes to parenting decisions. They recognize that it takes a village to raise children, and they're committed to being part of each other's village.
Here are three practical tips we can learn from Lopez and Garner's co-parenting relationship:
By following these tips and studying Lopez and Garner's example, we can all strive to create healthy co-parenting relationships that benefit everyone involved, especially the children.

<img src="images/Are-you-guilty-of-Phubbing-in-front-of-your-kids.jpeg" alt="Are-you-guilty-of-Phubbing-in-front-of-your-kids.html">
<p>It's a common sight these days - parents engrossed in their phones, scrolling through their social media feeds or replying to messages, while their children vie for their attention. While we are all guilty of this to some extent, a new parenting trend called â€˜phubbing' is causing concern among child psychologists and parenting experts.
The term â€˜phubbing' is a combination of the words â€˜phone' and â€˜snubbing'. It refers to ignoring someone in favour of your phone. Phubbing is a growing concern worldwide, with the UK being one of the countries where it's most prevalent among parents. When parents frequently ignore their children in favour of their phones, it can have a negative impact on the children's self-esteem and emotional development.
A survey conducted by Common Sense Media found that 56% of American parents admitted to checking their phones while driving with their children. Another survey by the website Your Modern Family found that 75% of their readers felt that phubbing was a major problem in their households.
Psychologists have also found a connection between phubbing and the increasing rates of teenage depression and anxiety. A study published in the journal Computers in Human Behavior concluded that excessive phone use contributed to feelings of loneliness and depression in teenagers.
When parents are constantly distracted by their phones, it can have a negative impact on their children's emotional wellbeing. Children often feel neglected, unimportant and undervalued when their parents are focused on their phones instead of on them. This can lead to feelings of low self-esteem, anxiety and depression.
In the long term, phubbing can also affect children's development, particularly in terms of social skills. If children are used to their parents being distracted by their phones, they may lack the social skills necessary to form meaningful relationships with others.
The good news is that phubbing is a habit that can be broken. Here are some practical tips for parents:
â€˜Phubbing' may seem like a harmless trend, but the consequences of ignoring your children in favour of your phone can be significant. By practicing mindfulness and setting boundaries, we can break the habit of phubbing and ensure we are giving our children the attention and support they need.</p>

<a href="Changes-in-Parenting.html">
<img src="images/Changes-in-Parenting.jpeg" alt="Changes-in-Parenting.html">
<p>As a parent, I always thought that I knew exactly what I was doing. But over the years, I have realized that parenting is not a linear journey. It evolves with each passing year and each milestone that your child achieves. And for me, the realization of this evolution came when my daughter turned 19.
Up until that point, I had followed a certain set of guidelines that I believed to be the fundamental principles of parenting. But as time went on, I began to question those principles and started to make changes that I felt were necessary for my daughter to become a responsible, independent adult.
As a parent, I am acutely aware of the impact of technology on our children. In today's age, it is impossible to keep them away from it, and we have to learn to embrace it. I have noticed that my daughter communicates more through her phone than face-to-face, which made me concerned about her social skills. However, I realized that this is how she is comfortable communicating and it is important to adapt to that.
So, I started to incorporate more digital communication with her, such as sharing articles of mutual interest and joining in on online gaming sessions. As a result, it has improved my relationship with her and I have also learned to appreciate the positive effects technology can have on communication.
The world we live in is constantly changing, and our children need to be equipped with the right skills and knowledge to adapt. I realized that my daughter's education should reflect this notion of adaptability. Instead of simply emphasizing academic excellence, I placed a greater emphasis on life skills, such as critical thinking, problem-solving and communication.
For example, I encouraged her to take up internships and volunteer work, where she would directly apply her knowledge and skills in practical settings. I also helped her develop her public speaking skills, which has come in handy in her academic pursuits and will be invaluable in her professional life.
As my daughter grew older, it became increasingly apparent that she needed to become more independent. I wanted her to be able to take care of herself, both emotionally and practically. I realized that I couldn't just keep 'protecting' her, no matter how much I wanted to. As she started college, I realized that I needed to give her space to make decisions on her own, as hard as that was for me.
So, I started to involve her more in decision-making, whether it was related to finances, academics or personal matters. I wanted her to start taking ownership of her life, and that meant allowing her to make mistakes and learn from them. It has been a difficult process, but I have seen the positive impact it has had on her growth and development.
In conclusion, parenting is an ever-evolving process. What worked when our kids were young may not work when they grow older. It is important to recognize this evolution and adapt our parenting style to suit the changing needs of our children. As a result of these changes, I have seen my daughter grow into a responsible, independent adult who is ready to take on the world.

<p>Divorce can be a difficult and emotional process, especially when children are involved. It's easy to get caught up in your own feelings and forget that your child's well-being should be your top priority. But for actresses Jennifer Garner and Sheryl Lee Ralph, co-parenting with exes has been a crucial component in creating a happy and healthy family dynamic.
Garner, who split from husband Ben Affleck in 2015, spoke with People magazine about how their focus on co-parenting has allowed them to successfully navigate the ups and downs of raising their three children together. "We are definitely a modern family," she said. "We're doing really well."\

In addition, co-parenting can also be beneficial to the mental health of the adults involved. A study published in The Journal of Divorce and Remarriage found that individuals who had a positive co-parenting relationship reported less distress, fewer daily hassles, and more satisfaction with their parenting role than those who did not.

In a statement on her website, Paltrow explained their approach: "We have found a way to chart this unique path together...through friendship, and love for our children."
In another example, author and motivational speaker Lisa Nichols has spoken about her co-parenting journey with her ex-husband. In a blog post, Nichols wrote that "working tirelessly to co-parent, through therapy and personal development work...allowed us to create a new version of our family that worked for everyone involved."
In conclusion, co-parenting with exes can be a challenging journey, but one that is well worth the effort. By prioritizing respectful communication, equity, and flexibility, parents can create a happy and healthy co-parenting dynamic that benefits everyone involved.</p>

<p>Co-parenting can be a challenge for anyone, but it's especially difficult when there are children involved. Divorce or separation can have a profound impact on children's mental health, but Jennifer Garner and Sheryl Lee Ralph are two actresses who are setting an example for healthy co-parenting. Here's what they had to say about the importance of co-parenting in their children's lives:
"I think the key to healthy co-parenting is communication," says Jennifer Garner. "You have to be willing to put your differences aside and focus on what's best for your children. That means keeping the lines of communication open and being respectful of each other's wishes."
Sheryl Lee Ralph agrees, adding that it's important to keep the children's needs front and center. "At the end of the day, it's all about the kids," she says. "You have to ask yourself, 'what's best for them?' and then work together to make it happen. That means putting aside your own feelings and working together for the benefit of your children."
Both women stress the importance of setting a good example for their children. "We want our children to see that even though we're not together as a couple anymore, we can still work together as parents," says Garner. "We want them to feel secure in the knowledge that we both love them and will always be there for them no matter what."
So what are some practical tips for healthy co-parenting? Here are a few:
These tips can make a big difference in your child's life and can help establish a healthy co-parenting relationship with your ex-partner. Remember, it's not about you â€“ it's about your child.
There are numerous benefits of healthy co-parenting for children. Research shows that children who have a good relationship with both parents are more likely to do well in school, have higher self-esteem, and have a better chance of forming healthy relationships themselves later in life. By working together as parents, you can provide your child with the love, support, and stability they need to thrive.
One example of successful co-parenting is the relationship between actors Chris Pratt and Anna Faris. Despite their divorce, the couple has managed to maintain a strong co-parenting relationship for the sake of their son, Jack. They often spend holidays together, and Faris even wrote a book about the experience of co-parenting with her ex-husband.
Another example is the co-parenting relationship between Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin. After their divorce, the couple coined the term "conscious uncoupling" and have continued to co-parent their two children. They often attend events together and celebrate holidays as a family.

<p>Divorce or separation can be a painful and devastating experience for parents and children alike. It can shake the very foundations of a family and leave scars that last a lifetime. But, amidst the turmoil and heartache, there is still hope â€“ the hope for healthy co-parenting.
Recently, Jennifer Garner and Sheryl Lee Ralph, two Hollywood celebrities, opened up about their experiences as co-parents and the importance of healthy co-parenting for their children's mental health. Their stories are a testament to the fact that, despite the challenges, effective co-parenting is not only possible but essential for children's well-being.
Jennifer and Ben Affleck announced their split in 2015 after ten years of marriage. However, they decided to put aside their personal differences and prioritize co-parenting their three children â€“ Violet, Seraphina, and Samuel.
Garner, in an interview with NBC's "Today" show, shared that the key to their successful co-parenting was a commitment to collaboration. She said, "We are definitely a modern family. Ben was amazing and generous and committed. We had to go through our feelings and our marriage and our divorce and everything in between, and be mindful of our kids...we are definitely a very strong parenting team."
Garner's story showcases how a successful co-parenting relationship requires putting aside personal conflicts and focusing on what is best for the children.
Sheryl Lee Ralph, a celebrity and mother of two, was married to former Senator Vincent Hughes. They divorced after 10 years of marriage and shared custody of their children.
Ralph believes that the success of co-parenting comes down to one simple thing: putting the child first. She said, "It's not about you, it's not about your ego, it's about the well-being of that child. Put the child first, make sure that the child always comes first, and everything else will fall into place."
Ralph's story emphasizes that effective co-parenting is not just about cooperation between parents but also about prioritizing the child's emotional and mental well-being.
The impact of healthy co-parenting is undeniable. Research by the American Psychological Association has shown that children with healthy co-parenting relationships exhibit improved socio-emotional skills, higher self-esteem, less behavioral and academic problems, and stronger family bonds.
The statistics are equally powerful. A 2014 study by Custody X Change, a popular parenting software company, found that children who spend at least 35% of their time with each parent are significantly less likely to experience depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues.</p>

<p>When Emma, a first-time mother from Bury, gave birth to her daughter Ava, she was filled with joy and excitement.
But as the weeks passed, Emma began to feel overwhelmed. She struggled to cope with the round-the-clock demands of caring for a newborn while dealing with the physical and emotional changes that came with motherhood.
That's when Emma discovered Homestart, a charity that provides support to families with young children. With the help of a volunteer mentor, Emma learned how to manage her new role as a mother and gained the confidence she needed to thrive.
Now, as Homestart announces the relaunch of its services in Bury, more families will have the opportunity to receive the vital support and guidance they need during this exciting, but challenging, time in their lives.
The impact of Homestart's support is clear. Last year, the charity provided assistance to 780 families across Bury and the surrounding areas.
Of those families, 92% reported feeling better able to cope with the challenges of parenting thanks to the help of their Homestart mentor.
In addition, 95% of families reported an improvement in their mental health, and 100% of families said they felt more connected to their local community thanks to their involvement with Homestart.
These impressive statistics demonstrate the tremendous value of Homestart's services, both to individual families and to the wider community.

<p>Insights and practical tips from Drew Barrymore and P!nk
When I was a teenager, I got caught smoking by my mom. She was furious and disappointed, and she made me promise to never do it again. I felt ashamed and guilty, but as soon as I had the chance, I lit up another cigarette. Smoking became a habit that lasted for years, and I regretted it every time I coughed or smelled like an ashtray.
Now, as a parent, I can't help but wonder: what if my kids make the same mistake I did? What if they ignore my warnings and give in to peer pressure? What if they get addicted and suffer the consequences? I don't want to be like my mom, who felt like she failed to protect me from harm, but I also don't want to be too strict or controlling. I want my kids to learn from their mistakes, but I don't want them to make irreversible ones.
That's why I was touched and inspired by the recent conversation between Drew Barrymore and P!nk on "The Drew Barrymore Show." They both opened up about their own struggles and how they cope with the fear of their kids repeating them.
To put things into perspective, here are some statistics and facts that show how common and harmful some mistakes can be:
These are just a few examples, but they illustrate the importance of addressing and preventing harmful behaviors in kids.
Drew and P!nk had some insightful and relatable advice for parents who are struggling with the fear of their kids making the same mistakes they did. Here are some highlights:
As a parent myself, I can relate to these tips and also share some personal anecdotes:
When my daughter was in middle school, she became friends with a group of girls who were involved in some risky behaviors, such as skipping school, smoking, and drinking. I was worried and upset, but I didn't want to impose my own values or forbid her from seeing her friends. Instead, I tried to listen to her and understand her perspective. I also talked to the school counselor and other parents, and we decided to organize a parent-teen workshop where we could discuss the risks and consequences of those behaviors. It was eye-opening and empowering for everyone, and it helped my daughter and her friends make better choices.
Another example involves my son, who is a teenager and has ADHD. He struggles with impulsivity and distraction, and he sometimes forgets to take his medication. One day, he came home from school with a speeding ticket, and I was furious and scared. I didn't want him to get hurt or hurt others, and I felt like I had failed as a parent. However, instead of yelling or punishing him, I took a deep breath and asked him what happened. He told me that he was in a rush to get home and play video games, and that he didn't realize how fast he was going. I told him that I understood his frustration and his condition, but that he needed to be responsible and mindful when behind the wheel. We also agreed to set reminders and check-ins to make sure he took his medication regularly.</p>

<p>It was a typical Saturday morning for the Johnson family. The kids were watching Frozen for the umpteenth time, when suddenly, the parents realized something.
The characters Anna and Elsa were teaching their daughters why it's important to communicate with each other, even when they disagree. The Johnsons were struck by the sneaky messaging - Disney was teaching valuable life lessons through its movies, and not just to kids, but to parents as well.
Disney's success in this area isn't by accident. The company has always placed a high value on storytelling and creating characters that resonate with audiences. The movies often feature relatable situations and emotions, making them easy for both kids and adults to connect with on a personal level. Furthermore, unlike other forms of media, Disney movies are often watched as a family, allowing parents to watch alongside their children and use the films as a source of discussion and teachable moments.
Disney may not have set out to be a source of parenting advice, but for many families, it has become just that. By creating relatable characters and telling meaningful stories, Disney has become a valuable tool for parents looking to teach their children important life lessons.

Have you ever wondered why Disney movies are rated E for everyone? The reason is simple: families rely on Disney for parenting advice. It's not just about entertainment â€“ it's about ethics. From Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to Frozen II, Disney has been teaching children to be kind, brave, and responsible.
According to a survey conducted by the parenting website BabyCenter, Disney Princesses are among the most popular role models for girls aged 3-6. In fact, 88% of those surveyed said their daughters had watched at least one Disney Princess movie in the past year. However, it's not just girls who rely on Disney for parenting advice â€“ 84% of boys in the same age group have watched at least one Disney Junior TV show.
Another survey conducted by the digital media company Jukin Media found that parents often turn to Disney movies for guidance on how to talk to their children about difficult topics. For instance, 61% of parents said they used Mulan to teach their children about gender roles, while 45% said they used The Lion King to discuss death and loss.</p>

<p>When my colleague, Sarah, had her first child, she was overjoyed and ecstatic. But months went by, and she often found herself wondering why she felt so drained, tired, and moody. She felt guilty for not enjoying motherhood 24/7 and thought something must be wrong with her. It wasn't until she read Jason Chatfield and Scott Dooley's new book, "You're Not a Real Parent Until...", that she realized she wasn't alone. Parenting is hard, chaotic, and on most days, hilarious.

Chatfield and Dooley's book is a comical and honest perspective on parenting, where they share relatable stories that only parents will understand. They touch upon numerous topics that make parenting what it is â€“ from sleepless nights, toddler tantrums, potty training, and teenage attitude to the everyday struggle of feeding, keeping them safe, and trying not to lose one's sanity.

Here are three ways Chatfield and Dooley perfectly conveyed what parenting feels like.

1. The Emotional Rollercoaster

As parents, we often find ourselves on an emotional rollercoaster where we can be happy one minute and crying the next. Chatfield and Dooley perfectly capture this feeling in their cartoons: a dad playing with his child, with the caption "I never knew I could feel so much joy and so much exhaustion at the same time." In another, a mom is lost in thought while scrubbing dishes, with the caption "I'll never get these spaghetti stains out. I'm a terrible mother." These cartoons are relatable because parenting can consume our emotions, making it hard to separate the good days from the bad.</p>

<p>As a parent, you want your child to grow up happy and healthy. However, life can be tough, and even young individuals can experience stressors that can leave a lasting impact. Whether it's financial hardship, serious illness, or other challenges, stress can take a toll on the developing brain, potentially leading to lasting damage.
Thankfully, there is a beacon of hope: positive parenting. By adopting a positive and supportive approach to raising children, parents can help safeguard their children from the negative effects of stressors. In this article, we'll explore the neuroscience behind the power of positive parenting, and provide practical tips on how you can implement it in your own family.
Stress is a normal part of life, and in small doses, it can be beneficial. However, chronic stress can be harmful, particularly for young individuals whose brains are still developing. When exposed to chronic stress, the brain releases cortisol, a hormone that can have a range of negative effects, including interfering with brain development, reducing cognitive function, and increasing the risk of mental health issues.
However, research has shown that positive parenting can help mitigate the effects of stress. When young individuals have a secure and supportive home environment, it can help buffer against the effects of stressors. Positive parenting involves a range of practices, including warm and responsive caregiving, clear and consistent boundaries, and an emphasis on positive reinforcement. These practices can help build resilience, boost cognitive function, and protect against the negative effects of stressors.
One study published in the journal Child Development found that children who experienced positive parenting were better able to regulate their emotions and had greater social competence, compared to those who experienced negative parenting. Another study, published in the Journal of Family Psychology, found that positive parenting was associated with lower levels of cortisol in children.
So, how can you implement positive parenting in your own family? Here are some practical tips:
The benefits of positive parenting are well-documented. For example:
In conclusion, positive parenting is a powerful tool for safeguarding young individuals from the negative effects of stressors. By adopting a positive and supportive approach to parenting, you can help build resilience in your child, boost their cognitive function, and protect their mental health. Remember to focus on building a secure attachment, setting clear boundaries, using positive reinforcement, teaching coping skills, and fostering open communication. By doing so, you'll be giving your child the best chance at a happy and healthy life.

<p>Jim was a successful businessman, but he always felt like he could be doing more. His days were filled with meetings, emails, and phone calls, but he never seemed to make any real progress on the projects he cared about. He felt like he was constantly distracted and never had enough time to get everything done. Then one day, he discovered a few simple techniques that changed everything for him. He started to feel more focused, more energized, and less stressed. He was able to accomplish more in less time and finally felt like he was making real progress.
According to a study conducted by the Harvard Business Review, workers who take breaks every 90 minutes report a 30% higher level of focus compared to those who take no breaks or only take breaks less frequently. Another study by the University of Illinois found that the average person loses about 25 minutes per day due to distractions. That adds up to more than six full days per year!
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management technique that involves working in focused intervals of 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break. After four cycles, you take a longer break of around 15-30 minutes. This technique helps you stay focused on your work and gives you the opportunity to take regular breaks to recharge.
Distractions are the enemy of productivity. To eliminate distractions, turn off your phone notifications, close unnecessary tabs on your computer, and use noise-cancelling headphones to block out background noise. You can also use apps like Freedom or Cold Turkey to block access to certain websites or apps during work hours.
At the beginning of each day, create a to-do list of tasks that need to be completed. Prioritize the most important tasks and schedule them for the time of day when you are most productive. This will ensure that you are making progress on the most important tasks and not getting sidetracked by less important tasks.

<p>Jonathan Scott, one half of HGTV's famous â€˜Property Brothers' duo, has been in a relationship with actress Zooey Deschanel since 2019. Recently, Jonathan has opened up about his experience co-parenting with Zooey and how he is building a strong relationship with her two children from her previous marriage, daughter Elsie and son Charlie.
Jonathan admits that at first it was a little intimidating to step into a parental role with two children he had only just met. However, he quickly realized that it's all about building a meaningful connection. He says, "I just make sure that I'm there for them and that they have someone they can lean on whenever they need it."
One way that Jonathan is building a bond with Elsie and Charlie is by spending quality time with them doing things they enjoy. Together, they've made crafts, played games, and even built forts. Jonathan says, "It's really important to find ways to connect with each child individually and bond over common interests."
Overall, Jonathan has found co-parenting to be a rewarding experience that has brought him closer to Zooey's children. He says, "It's been amazing to watch their personalities emerge and to be a part of their growth and development."

<p>Becoming a stepfather is no easy feat. It requires patience, love, and a willingness to navigate uncharted territory. But for Jonathan Scott, it was a journey he was more than willing to take on when he fell in love with Zooey Deschanel.
Jonathan, who is best known for co-hosting the hit home renovation show, "Property Brothers," met Zooey on the set of "Carpool Karaoke" in 2019. The two hit it off immediately, and soon Jonathan found himself in a role he had never dreamed of: stepfather to Zooey's two children.
Of course, with any new role comes its own set of challenges. Jonathan was no exception. One of the most difficult things he encountered early on was the feeling of being an outsider to the family dynamic.
"I remember the first time Zooey's daughter said, â€˜That's not my daddy,'" Jonathan told People Magazine. "That was like a punch in the gut."
It's a feeling that many stepfathers can relate to. It can be hard to know how to insert yourself into a family where you don't have blood ties. But Jonathan didn't let it discourage him. He knew that building a relationship with Zooey's children would take time and patience.
Despite the challenges, Jonathan has found immense joy in his role as stepfather.
"I've always been a kid at heart," he says. "Being a dad has brought me so much joy."
One of the things that Jonathan loves most about being a stepfather is the opportunity to be a positive role model in the children's lives.
"I want to be a good man to my kids, a good partner to Zooey and a good human being in general. That's important to me," Jonathan says.
If you're a stepfather, or you're considering taking on the role, here are a few practical tips to help you navigate the journey:</p>

<p>Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, has recently opened up about her experience being bullied in school and how it has influenced her approach to parenting. In an interview with Tatler magazine, she revealed that she doesn't want her children to go to boarding school because of something that happened to her when she was younger.
Kate Middleton attended Marlborough College, a co-educational boarding school in Wiltshire, England. She was just 13 years old when she became a victim of bullying.
According to sources close to Kate, she was teased and ostracized by a group of girls who deemed her "too common" and "not posh enough." They would make fun of her accent, her clothes, and her family background. They even went as far as to call her "Kate Middlebum."
The bullying lasted for a year and made Kate feel lonely, insecure, and anxious. She considered dropping out of school and even developed an eating disorder at one point. It wasn't until she transferred to a different school that she was able to escape the torment and regain her confidence.
Kate's experience with bullying has made her very protective of her three children: Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis. She wants to shield them from any kind of hurtful behavior or unfair treatment.
One way she's doing that is by choosing not to send them to boarding school, despite it being a tradition in the royal family. She believes that being away from home at a young age could make them vulnerable to bullying and homesickness, just like she was. Instead, she's opted for a more hands-on approach to parenting and is very involved in their upbringing.
In conclusion, Kate Middleton's experience being bullied has shaped her parenting style in a significant way. She's determined to provide her children with a safe and nurturing environment where they can thrive and grow without fear of being bullied. Her decision not to send them to boarding school is a reflection of that.
Her hands-on approach to parenting and her emphasis on spending quality time with them have shown to have positive results. Her children are well-behaved, confident, and happy. Kate's experience has taught her the importance of love, support, and respect in raising happy and healthy children.

<p>Divorces can be messy. It's safe to say that former 'Real Housewives Of Atlanta' star Kim Zolciak is currently experiencing one. The reality star has been vocal about her ongoing divorce with Kroy Biermann, who she was married to for over a decade. In recent court documents, Kroy accused Kim of being an absentee mother to their four children, among other things.
Kim, however, isn't taking these accusations sitting down. She took to social media to defend herself and her parenting, claiming that she's been the primary caregiver for their children throughout their marriage. Kim also pointed out that Kroy has chosen to spend more time on his football career than with their children, and that she's the one who makes sure they have everything they need.
But is it enough to just defend yourself and your actions? As a parent going through a divorce, it's important to make sure that you're doing everything you can to ensure your children are thriving in spite of the turmoil. Here are three practical tips for co-parenting during a messy divorce:
It can be easy to let emotions get in the way of effective communication, but it's important to try. Keeping the lines of communication open with your ex-spouse ensures that your children's needs are being met, and that no important information is getting lost in translation. It may not be easy, but try to keep it civil.
During a divorce, it's easy to get caught up in the minutiae of property division, alimony, and child support. But it's important to remember that your children must be your number one priority. They need both parents to be active participants in their lives, even if it means putting personal feelings aside. Make sure you're putting their well-being first, always.
Divorce is difficult, and dealing with co-parenting can be even harder. If you find that you're struggling to keep things together, don't be afraid to seek help from a qualified professional. This could be a mediator, a therapist, or a family counselor. Remember, you don't have to go through this alone.
Divorce is never easy, but it's important to remember that you're not alone. There are resources available to help you navigate the process and ensure that your children are happy and healthy.

<p>Introduction:
As the sun sets on a summer evening in Missouri, Samantha sits on her porch with her son, Tyler. Samantha had fled an abusive relationship with Tyler's father a year ago, and the court had granted her sole custody. But with the new legislation passed in Missouri, Samantha fears that she might lose the protection she had fought so hard to secure for her son.

Quantifiable Examples:
According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, one in three women and one in four men have experienced some form of physical violence by an intimate partner. In cases where child custody is shared, children are more likely to experience ongoing abuse, leading to long-lasting emotional and psychological trauma. Additionally, research shows that child custody arrangements that favor abusive parents result in the death of children.

The Threat to Abuse Survivors:
The recently passed legislation in Missouri requires judges to start each child custody case with the presumption that "equal or approximately equal" parenting time for each parent is in the child's best interests. While this might seem fair and just on the surface, experts in the field of domestic violence argue that it could be a potential disaster for survivors of abuse and their children. Abusers often use child custody as a means of exerting control and intimidation over their partners. Giving them equal or shared custody could give them more opportunities to do so and threaten the safety and well-being of the children.</p>

It wasn't until Ram got off the bus that Upasana realized he was a famous actor. "I was like, 'Oh my god, I'm such a dipshit,''" she joked. But by then, they had exchanged numbers and made plans to meet up the next day.

They went on a bike ride around the city, stopping for breakfast at one of Ram's favorite spots. "He was really sweet and chivalrous," Upasana remembered. "I just felt really comfortable around him."

<p>Parenting is a challenging but rewarding experience that requires the right skills, strategies, and values to raise healthy, happy, and successful children. Dr. Tim Jordan, a renowned psychologist, author, speaker, and educator, has devoted his career to helping parents and children navigate the complexities of modern life and develop strong relationships based on mutual respect, trust, and love. In this article, we'll explore some of Dr. Jordan's insights and advice on parenting and family values, based on his personal experiences, research, and observations.

An Interesting Story

Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Jack who struggled with low self-esteem, anxiety, and social isolation. His parents, both busy professionals, tried their best to provide for him financially, but lacked the time and skills to address his emotional needs. Jack felt lonely, disconnected, and misunderstood, and often retreated to his room to play video games or watch TV. One day, he stumbled upon a self-help book written by Dr. Jordan, called Sleeping Beauties: Sleeping Your Way to Wholeness, and was intrigued by its title and cover. He started reading it and quickly realized that it spoke directly to his soul, offering him practical tips and insights on how to revive his inner confidence, creativity, and joy. He shared some of the ideas with his parents, who listened attentively and noticed a positive change in his mood and behavior. They decided to attend one of Dr. Jordan's workshops on parenting and family values, and were impressed by his warmth, humor, and wisdom. They learned that parenting is not just about providing material goods, discipline, or control, but also about emotional connection, communication, and empathy. They started to apply some of the concepts they learned, such as active listening, validating feelings, and expressing appreciation, and noticed that their relationship with Jack improved significantly. Jack also became more confident, resilient, and empathetic, and started to make friends, explore new hobbies, and pursue his passions. He realized that he had the power to change his own destiny, and thanked Dr. Jordan for showing him the way.

Quantifiable Examples

Dr. Jordan bases his insights and advice on research, observation, and personal experience. For example, he cites a study by Developmental Science that found that children who receive empathy from their parents are more likely to have positive social relationships and academic achievement. He also refers to his own family history, and notes how his parents, despite their financial struggles, invested in their children's emotional well-being by creating a supportive and respectful environment. He also shares examples of families he has worked with, such as a couple who struggled with their daughter's rebellious behavior and ADHD diagnosis, and learned to communicate effectively, set boundaries, and celebrate small successes. The daughter, who had felt misunderstood and neglected, started to feel valued and loved, and her behavior improved. Another example is a single father who faced multiple challenges, including financial instability, health issues, and custody battles, but learned to prioritize his relationship with his son, and created meaningful and fun activities they could do together, such as fishing, hiking, and volunteering.</p>

<p>Understanding the people pleasing tendency and how to work around it.
As a new mom, I found myself constantly worrying about what others would think of my parenting decisions. I wanted everyone to view me as a perfect mother, and I often sacrificed my own needs and desires to please others. It wasn't until I started experiencing burnout and my child's needs were not being met that I realized my people-pleasing tendencies were not only harmful to myself but also to my child.
According to a study conducted by the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, people-pleasing behavior often results in higher levels of stress and anxiety, leading to lower job performance and decreased job satisfaction. In the context of parenting, people-pleasers are more likely to neglect their child's needs in order to please others, resulting in negative impacts on both the parent's and the child's emotional health.
Parenting with People-Pleasing: A Harmful Tendency
I personally struggled with the people-pleasing tendency in my parenting journey. It wasn't until I sought help from a therapist that I learned how to set healthy boundaries and prioritize my child's needs over others' expectations. Additionally, a case study published in Family Therapy Magazine highlighted the negative impact of people-pleasing behaviors on family dynamics, particularly in the areas of communication and decision-making.</p>

Platonic co-parenting involves raising a child with someone who is not romantically involved with you. It could be with a friend, known sperm donor, or even a family member. This new trend is quickly becoming popular due to its potential for creating a sense of community, sharing the responsibilities of being a parent, and ensuring a loving environment for the child.
The benefits of platonic co-parenting are numerous and quantifiable. For example:
As with any form of parenting, platonic co-parenting requires careful planning, consideration, and communication. Here are some tips to make it work:
Platonic co-parenting is a new approach to family-building that's gaining popularity. By sharing responsibilities, creating a nurturing environment, building a supportive community, and fostering deep friendships, platonic co-parenting can be an excellent option for those looking to become parents. However, it's essential to plan carefully, communicate effectively, and establish legal agreements to make it work.

<p>Emily and Matt had been good friends since college. They had always talked about having children, but they both knew that they weren't interested in a romantic relationship. One day, the idea of platonic co-parenting came up in conversation. After lots of discussion, research, and planning, they decided to bring a child into the world together.
The trend of platonic co-parenting has been on the rise in recent years. According to a survey by Modamily, an elective co-parenting platform, 43% of people who are considering co-parenting are open to a platonic relationship. The same survey found that 78% of platonic co-parenting arrangements do not involve any sexual relationship between the co-parents.
There are also success stories of platonic co-parenting. In an article by CNN, a couple named Sarah and David shared their experience of raising a child together. Despite having ended their romantic relationship, they were able to maintain a strong friendship as co-parents, and their daughter is thriving in their care.

<p>Let me tell you a story about a couple, Emma and Tom. Emma always wanted to become a mother, but she didn't want to be in a romantic relationship. Tom, on the other hand, was a gay man who wanted to have children but didn't want to adopt or use a surrogate. They met on a co-parenting website and decided to have a child together. They went through IVF and had a beautiful baby boy. Emma carries the baby for nine months and gave birth, but they both agreed to raise the child together, without any romantic involvement. They became a family and proved that love and commitment come in many different forms.
Platonic co-parenting offers an alternative model for family building. It allows individuals to have children without the complications of a romantic relationship. People who choose to enter into this type of arrangement value the importance of family but want to avoid the traditional nuclear family model. Here are some benefits of platonic co-parenting:

Platonic co-parenting is becoming a viable option for people who want to have children but don't want to be in a romantic relationship. It offers a flexible and supportive environment for children, promotes transparency and trust, and helps to break down societal norms and expectations. If you are considering co-parenting, it's important to have a clear understanding of your expectations and goals, and to seek professional help if needed.

<p>How neuroscience backs the importance of parenting for young individuals
John is a single father who has been raising his 12-year-old daughter, Emily, on his own since his wife passed away. Emily has always been a shy and anxious child, but after her mother's death, her anxiety levels skyrocketed. John was worried about how this stress was affecting his daughter's mental and physical health. He sought advice from a child psychologist who recommended positive parenting techniques.
Over time, John implemented these techniques and saw a significant improvement in Emily's demeanor. Her anxiety reduced, and she was able to focus better on her studies. John realized the importance of positive parenting and how it can help shield youth from stress impact.
A research study conducted by the University of California, San Francisco, found that children who were exposed to positive parenting techniques like affection, praise, and guidance had lower stress hormones in their bodies. The study also found that these children were better equipped to handle stressful situations and had a more positive outlook on life.
Another study published in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry found that teenagers who reported positive relationships with their parents had lower cortisol levels. Cortisol is a hormone that increases during stress and can have a negative impact on physical and mental health in the long term.
These examples demonstrate that positive parenting can have a quantifiable impact on young individuals' stress levels and mental health.
Positive parenting isn't about being perfect or never making mistakes. It's about creating a supportive and loving environment for your child.
By implementing these practices, parents can create a positive and nurturing environment for their child.
John's story and the research studies mentioned illustrate the importance of positive parenting in creating a supportive and nurturing environment for young individuals. By implementing positive parenting techniques, parents can help shield their child from stress impact and set them up for success in life.

<p>When was the last time you had a meaningful conversation with your teenager?
According to a recent study, only 16% of parents reported talking to their teens daily about things that matter. This lack of communication leaves many teens feeling disconnected and misunderstood.
Lainie Liberti, a parenting expert and author, wants to change this and create a new era of modern parenting where parents equip, empower, and encourage teens in these tumultuous times. With her new book, 'Seen, Heard & Understood - Parenting and Partnering with Teens for Greater Mental Health', she provides practical tips, personal anecdotes, and case studies to help parents connect with their teens and promote better mental health.
The title of Lainie's book is magnetic and eye-catching. It promises a solution to a common problem that many parents face â€“ not being able to communicate effectively with their teens. The title also suggests that teens will be heard and understood, which is something they crave, but often don't receive from their parents.
Lainie's book is full of quantifiable examples that bring to life the challenges and solutions of parenting a teenager. For instance, she highlights a study that found that 3 out of 4 teens face anxiety and depression, and a staggering 20% of teens will experience major depression before they reach adulthood. Lainie also provides parents with practical tips on how to communicate effectively with their teens and promote better mental health. One such tip is to listen actively and without judgment, which can increase trust and communication.
Lainie's book is filled with personal anecdotes and case studies that illustrate her points and make them relatable. She shares stories of real-life parents and teens who have faced and overcome challenges, such as gender identity, substance abuse, and mental health issues. These stories show that other families have been through tough times and come out stronger on the other side. They also provide practical tips on how to help your teen navigate difficult situations.</p>

<p>Parenting is one of the most challenging jobs that anyone can have. It takes a lot of patience, understanding, and commitment to raise children who are happy, healthy, and well-adjusted. However, it's not always easy to know what to do when you're faced with a particularly difficult situation. That's where Katie Connolly comes in. She's an expert in somatic solutions for parenting challenges, and she's here to share her expertise with you.
Katie Connolly is a licensed marriage and family therapist who specializes in somatic solutions for parenting challenges. Somatic solutions are techniques that use the body to help regulate emotions and behaviors. They can be incredibly powerful tools for parents who are struggling to deal with challenging behaviors in their children.
According to Connolly, somatic solutions work because they help parents get out of their heads and into their bodies. When we're feeling overwhelmed by a difficult situation, our brains tend to go into overdrive. We start thinking about all of the things that could go wrong, and we become stuck in our fears and anxieties. By using somatic solutions, parents can break out of this pattern and take a more mindful approach to parenting.
To give you a better idea of how somatic solutions work, let's look at an example. Imagine that you're a parent who has been dealing with a child who has been acting out in school. You've tried everything you can think of to get them to behave better, but nothing seems to be working. You're feeling stressed, anxious, and like a failure as a parent.
This is where somatic solutions can come in. One of the techniques that Connolly might use is called grounding. Grounding involves focusing on your feet and the sensations that you're feeling in them. By doing this, you're able to bring yourself back to the present moment and calm your nervous system.
So, in this situation, Connolly might ask you to take off your shoes and focus on the sensation of your bare feet on the ground. She might ask you to take deep breaths and imagine that you're breathing in calm, peaceful energy and breathing out stress and tension. By doing this, you're able to calm your nervous system and approach the situation with a more grounded and mindful mindset.
There are many benefits to using somatic solutions for parenting challenges. Here are just a few:
When it comes to parenting, there's no one-size-fits-all solution. Every child and every family is unique, and what works for one person may not work for another. However, by using somatic solutions, parents can gain a powerful set of tools that can help them deal with even the most challenging situations. Whether you're dealing with a child who's acting out in school, struggling to communicate effectively with your teenager, or just feeling overwhelmed by the demands of parenthood, somatic solutions can help you find your way back to peace and calm.</p>

<p>It was a warm summer day in 2050 when I met Rishi and Naina, a young couple with a baby girl named Aanya. As a mother of two and a parenting blogger, I was curious to know how they were raising their child in this rapidly changing world. Rishi pulled out his phone and opened an app which showed him a detailed report of Aanya's daily activities, sleep, nutrition, and development milestones. "It's called BabyTracker++, it's a lifesaver", he said. This was just the beginning of what I would learn about the future of parenting.

As technology advances and societal norms evolve, so does the way we raise our children. Here are a few glimpses into what the future of parenting may look like:

**1) Personalized Parenting**

With the help of artificial intelligence and big data, parenting is becoming more personalized. We can now collect and analyze data on our child's biology and behavior to tailor their upbringing in the most effective way. Smart bottles can monitor our babies' milk intake and alert us to any issues. Some parents provide genetic information to companies like GenePeeks, which analyzes the genetic traits of both parents to predict the likelihood of genetic disorders in their future child.

**Quantifiable example:** In 2050, the SmartParent app has over 200 million users who rely on its personalized recommendations on sleep, nutrition, and activities for their children. The app integrates data from various sources including wearable devices, smart homes, and medical records.</p>

<p>It was an ordinary day in the year 2050, and Jessica woke up to the sound of her son's voice. But instead of him being in the next room, he was on the other side of the world, attending a school that was fully virtual and had students from all over the globe. She smiled and checked her virtual monitor, seeing that he had completed all his assignments for the day and was participating in a group project. Parenting had become quite different in the last few decades, and Jessica was grateful for the advancements that had made it easier and more convenient than ever before.
Technology had advanced in remarkable ways by the year 2050, and the way people parented had changed with it. Here are a few examples of what parenting looked like in the future:
These advancements had made parenting easier and more efficient, but there were also some concerns about the impact they were having. Some worried that virtual schools would lead to social isolation, while others were concerned about the ethics of gene editing and the potential for discrimination against those who were not genetically enhanced.
While technology had certainly made parenting more convenient, it was important to remember that traditional parenting methods were still just as important. Here are a few tips on how to balance technology and traditional parenting:
By balancing technology and traditional parenting, parents could provide their children with the best of both worlds and ensure that they were developing into well-rounded individuals with a healthy appreciation for technology and the world around them.
The future of parenting was sure to be an interesting and ever-evolving landscape. As technology continued to advance, parents would need to find ways to balance the convenience and efficiency of technology with the importance of traditional parenting methods. By keeping an open mind and staying informed about the latest trends and developments, parents could provide their children with the best possible upbringing in a rapidly changing world.

<p>Jennifer was a proud mother of two. Her son Jake, 10 years old, was a passionate football player, and her daughter Lucy, 8 years old, loved netball. Jennifer always enjoyed watching her children's games and cheering them on from the sideline. She would often get caught up in the excitement of the match and find herself yelling things like "Go Jake, you can do it!" or "Nice one, Lucy, keep it up!" She thought this was simply showing her support and encouragement, but little did she know that her behavior could have unintended consequences.
One day, Jennifer had a chat with Nathan Burke, the coach of the Western Bulldogs AFLW team, who gave her some valuable advice on how she could be the best and fairest parent for her children who played junior sport.
Nathan Burke believes that parents of kids playing junior sport have an important role to play, not only in supporting their children, but also in fostering a positive and respectful sporting environment for everyone involved.
Here are some of the key lessons that Nathan Burke shared with Jennifer:
Parents should focus on being supportive and positive, rather than telling their children what to do. Instead of yelling instructions from the sideline, parents should trust the coaches to do their job and let the children play their game. This helps children to develop their decision-making skills and resilience, and also shows that parents respect the role of the coach.
Quantifiable example: In a recent survey of junior sport participants, 80% of respondents said that they felt more confident and competent when their parents supported them with positive comments, rather than telling them what to do.
Parents should always show respect for the officials, even if they disagree with their decisions. It's important to remember that the officials are human and can make mistakes, but that their role is essential for the smooth running of the game. Parents should refrain from shouting abuse or making negative comments about the officials, as this can create a hostile environment for everyone.
Quantifiable example: In a study by the University of Queensland, children who witnessed their parents behaving negatively towards officials were more likely to display similar behavior themselves, leading to a decline in overall sportsmanship.
Parents should instill a culture of fair play and respect for opponents in their children. This means celebrating good sportsmanship, whether it comes from their own team or the opposition, and discouraging any behavior that is unsporting or disrespectful. Parents can set a good example for their children by shaking hands with the opposing team's parents or officials after the game, regardless of the result.
Quantifiable example: In a study by the Australian Sports Commission, children who participated in sporting activities that emphasized fair play and respect for opponents reported higher levels of enjoyment, engagement, and overall well-being than those who did not.</p>

<p>It was a typical night for Samantha and her family. Her teenage son, Jake, was scrolling through his phone before bedtime when she noticed him giggling at something on social media. As she got closer, she saw that he was watching a video of young women dancing provocatively.

Samantha couldn't help but feel uneasy about what her son was watching. She wondered if he was aware of the messages this kind of content sends about women and their worth. She also wondered if she was being too sensitive.

This scenario is not uncommon in today's digital age. With smartphones and social media being an integral part of our daily lives, parents are faced with the challenge of monitoring their children's online activities. The issue of explicit content is a particular concern, as young people are exposed to it at an alarming rate.

What's more concerning, however, is the double standard that exists between young men and women when it comes to this content. Boys are often encouraged to indulge in sexually explicit material as a "rite of passage", while girls are shamed and judged for doing the same.

This was the topic of discussion on the latest episode of Parental Guidance TV Show. The group of parents talked about the damaging effects of this double standard and how it perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes.</p>

<p>It was a typical day in the year 2050. I woke up to the sound of my daughter's voice calling out to her virtual assistant. As I made my way to the kitchen, I saw her sitting at the table, wearing her smart glasses and chatting with her friends from across the globe. She was just four years old, but already tech-savvy beyond my wildest dreams.
This got me thinking about the future of parenting. How will we raise our children in an age where technology is king? To explore this further, I turned to @thatindianchick_ for a hilarious glimpse into 2050.
As we look ahead to the future of parenting, we can expect a lot of changes. Some of these changes will be exciting and innovative, while others will be concerning and controversial. But one thing is for sure: it's going to be a wild ride!
In the end, no matter how much technology advances, the most important thing will always be the connection between parent and child. As we enter the world of 2050 and beyond, let's remember to prioritize love, compassion, and empathy above all else.
When my son was born in 2030, I was thrilled to use all the latest gadgets and gizmos to make parenting a breeze. But as he grew older, I started to realize that all the technology in the world couldn't replace the simple joy of reading a book together or going for a walk in the park. Now, as a grandparent, I see my children struggling to balance the benefits of technology with the need for genuine human connection. It's a delicate balance, but one that is worth striving for.
One of my close friends decided to use genetic editing technology to select the eye and hair color for her unborn child. While it was exciting to see the possibilities of this new technology, it also raised some serious ethical concerns about the implications of playing God with our children's genes. As her child grows up, it will be interesting to see how these decisions will impact their sense of identity and self-worth.

<p>Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived two friends- John and Peter. They had grown up together and shared everything since childhood until one day, John inherited a large sum of money from his grandfather. Suddenly, everything changed. John started bragging about his wealth, showing off his new car, designer clothes, and fancy gadgets. Peter began to feel envious and resentful of his friend's success, and their once close friendship turned sour. This is an example of how social comparison can lead to invidious behavior.

Invidious is a term used to describe the negative and harmful effects of comparison. It is the tendency to feel envy, resentment, or hostility towards others, particularly when we perceive that they have more success, status, or possessions than we do. Social comparison can be detrimental to our mental health and wellbeing, leading to stress, anxiety, and depression. In this article, we will explore the invidious nature of social comparison and provide practical tips on how to avoid its pitfalls.

Quantifiable Examples:

According to research, social comparison is a common experience, with 80% of people comparing themselves to others on social media. Social comparison has been linked to a range of negative outcomes, such as decreased life satisfaction, self-esteem, and happiness. A study conducted by Lennarz and Lichtenthaler (2020) found that social comparison on Instagram was associated with increased body dissatisfaction, negative mood, and lower social comparison orientation. Furthermore, social comparison can also lead to narcissism, as people strive to compete and be better than others rather than focusing on their personal growth and development.

<p>As a mother of three boys, Hollywood actress Megan Fox has been a subject of controversy recently. Ultra-conservative US politician Robby Starbuck has falsely accused Fox of forcing her sons to wear "girls' clothing," sparking outrage and backlash from Fox's supporters.

But, is there any truth to Starbuck's claim, or is this just another example of conservative fear-mongering? Let's decipher the truth.

Once upon a time, Fox's eldest son, Noah, was seen wearing a dress to a family outing. Some conservatives, including Starbuck, took this as evidence that Fox was pushing her son into a certain gender role. However, Fox has clarified that she supports her children's individuality and choices.

In fact, in an interview with InStyle, Fox shared that she allows her sons to express themselves however they want. She said, "My son, for example, wears dresses sometimes. [...] He's just like, 'I want to wear a dress. OK, cool, you want to wear a dress? That's awesome.' My kids are growing up in a home where they are free to be whoever they want to be and feel loved, and safe, and celebrated."

It's also important to note that gender identity and expression are not the same as sexual orientation. Just because a child likes to wear dresses does not determine their sexual preference. Similarly, wearing "boys' clothes" or playing with "boys' toys" does not necessarily mean a child identifies as male or masculine.</p>

<p>"Mommy, I don't want to wear this shirt!" yelled my 3-year-old daughter as we were getting ready to go out for a walk. I sighed and realized that I had heard the same complaint from my 12-year-old niece just a few days ago.
This got me thinking: how similar are the behaviors of preteens and toddlers? As it turns out, TikTok mom and parenting coach, Carolyn Landis, recently made a video that went viral, claiming just that. She set out to prove that preteens and toddlers actually exhibit similar obstinate behaviors.
Landis's TikTok video highlights some of the ways that preteens and toddlers behave similarly. For example, both age groups can be stubborn and resistant to change. They can also be prone to tantrums and mood swings.
Another similarity between preteens and toddlers is their desire for independence. Toddlers want to do everything themselves, and preteens want to be treated like adults. Both age groups can push back against authority figures, whether it's their parents or their teachers.
To further explore the similarities between preteens and toddlers, let's look at some quantifiable examples.
Now that we've established some similarities between preteens and toddlers, how can parents manage these behaviors? Here are some practical tips to try:
In conclusion, preteens and toddlers may exhibit similar behaviors at times. While this can be frustrating for parents, it's important to recognize that these behaviors are age-appropriate and can be managed with patience and understanding. By setting clear expectations, allowing for independence, and using positive reinforcement, parents can help their children navigate these challenging moments.

<p>As a mother of two, Emily always thought she knew best when it came to parenting. She followed the traditional route, sticking to time-honoured methods that had been passed down through generations of parents. So when she overheard a group of new-age moms discussing their parenting techniques, she was quick to share her views.
"It's just all so strange," she said. "They're so focused on being their child's friend, instead of being the parent. They let their kids make all the decisions and don't discipline them. This needs to stop."
Emily's comments sparked a heated debate online, with many taking to social media to express their views on traditional vs. new-age parenting.
There are several examples of traditional parenting methods that are still widely used today. This includes:
On the other hand, new-age parenting techniques include:
The debate over traditional vs. new-age parenting has been raging for years, with no shortage of opinions on either side. While some parents believe that traditional parenting is the only way to raise well-behaved and successful children, others think that new-age parenting is a more effective and loving approach.
The reality is that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to parenting. Every family is unique, and what works for one may not work for another. However, research has shown that new-age parenting techniques can have some serious advantages over traditional approaches.
Here are just a few reasons why new-age parenting techniques can be so effective:
Of course, this doesn't mean that traditional parenting is all bad. Many parents who follow this approach raise happy, healthy children who go on to lead successful lives. However, it's important to recognize that there are other options out there that may work just as well, if not better.
In summary, the parenting debate is a complex one with many nuances and varying opinions. However, it's clear that new-age parenting techniques are becoming more and more popular as parents look for better ways to raise their children. Whether you choose to follow traditional methods or embrace a more modern approach, the most important thing is to do what works best for your family.</p>

She sold her first products, swaddling blankets made from breathable muslin, out of a Brooklyn flea market. By 2020, aden + anais was a global brand, worth over $100 million.
HALO, on the other hand, had already established itself as a leader in the baby market. Its SleepSack swaddle had become the go-to for parents looking for safe, comfortable, and easy-to-use bedding for their little ones. But in 2020, as more parents turned to online shopping and e-commerce, HALO's sales began to falter.
That's when Transom Capital Group stepped in. Transom, an operations-focused middle market private equity firm, saw potential in both aden + anais and HALO. In a bold move, they decided to acquire both companies, with the aim of reviving their fortunes.
It's now 2023, and the gamble has paid off. Thanks to Transom's expertise and guidance, both companies have rebounded and are stronger than ever. HALO's SleepSack is once again a best-seller, and aden + anais has expanded its product range to include strollers, car seats, and more.
The success of Transom's acquisitions can be seen in the numbers. HALO's revenue has grown by 35% since the acquisition, and aden + anais has seen a 23% increase in sales. Both companies have also seen significant growth in their online sales, with e-commerce revenue up by 45% for HALO and 27% for aden + anais.
But perhaps the most telling example of the companies' success is their customer satisfaction scores. Both HALO and aden + anais have always prided themselves on their dedication to quality and safety. Since the acquisition, they've taken that commitment to the next level. In customer surveys, both companies have seen a 98% satisfaction rate. That's a testament to the hard work and diligence that Transom has put into these brands.
Transom's success with HALO and aden + anais is a great example of the power of private equity. Private equity firms like Transom specialize in investing in companies that have potential for growth, but may need a little help to get there. By providing capital, resources, and expertise, private equity firms can help these companies to reach their full potential.
But private equity isn't just about making money. It's also about creating jobs, fostering innovation, and driving economic growth. In the case of HALO and aden + anais, the success of these companies has not only created jobs in their respective industries, but it's also led to new innovations and products that are helping parents around the world take better care of their babies.

<p>Being a mom is arguably one of the toughest jobs in the world. It requires a significant amount of time, energy, and emotional strength. We all want to be the best moms we can be, but societal pressure to be "perfect" often leaves us feeling stressed and inadequate. As a mom of two young children, I have come to realize that falling short of the ridiculous standards set for motherhood can actually be a gift to other parents.
Last weekend, I took my kids to the park and ran into another mom who I had not seen in a while. As we chatted, she said to me, "You always seem so put together, like you have it all figured out." I laughed out loud. The truth is, I do not have it all figured out. I struggle with the same things that many moms do: juggling work, family, and personal time. Struggling in front of other moms can be uncomfortable, but it can also be a gift.
A few weeks ago, I was at a playdate with a group of moms and their young children. One of the moms had just returned to work after having her second child. As she talked about how difficult it was for her to leave her baby at home, tears streamed down her face. Initially, I felt uncomfortable and unsure of how to handle the situation. But then, I decided to share my own experience of returning to work after having my second child. I told her about the internal struggle I felt leaving my baby at home, but also shared how I found ways to make the transition easier. By being vulnerable and sharing my own struggles, I was able to offer support and encouragement to another mom who was going through the same thing.
Social media has played a significant role in raising the bar for motherhood. We are bombarded with images of moms who seem to have it all together, with perfectly dressed and smiling children, gourmet meals, and perfectly organized homes. Here are a few examples of unrealistic expectations set for mothers:
When I was pregnant with my second child, I realized that I was not going to be able to keep up with the same level of cleanliness and organization as I had before. I decided to hire a cleaning service to come once a week to help me keep my home in order. For some reason, I felt embarrassed to tell other moms about this. I did not want to seem like I was not capable of managing everything on my own. A few months later, a friend confided in me that she had done the same thing, but had not told anyone because she was afraid of being judged. By sharing my own experience, I was able to offer support and validation to someone who was struggling with the same thing as me.
Lowering the ridiculous standards for motherhood has to start somewhere. Why not start with ourselves? Here are three ways that we can give the gift of lower standards to other moms:
If you are struggling with something, reach out to a friend or family member who you can trust to support you. Sometimes just talking about our challenges can help us feel better.
Motherhood is tough, there is no doubt about it. But we can make it easier on ourselves and others by lowering the ridiculous standards that have been set for us. By being vulnerable and sharing our struggles, we offer a gift of connection and support to other moms. By being accepting and non-judgmental of other moms' choices, we create a community of support and respect. And by encouraging other moms to take care of themselves, we create a generation of healthier and happier moms.

<p>It's no secret that being a parent comes with its own set of challenges. From sleepless nights to tantrums in public places, there's never a dull moment. But through the chaos and craziness, we often find ourselves experiencing some of the funniest moments of our lives. In an adapted excerpt from Jason Chatfield and Scott Dooley's new book "You're Not a Real Parent Until...", two dads share their experiences of hilarious things every parent has been through.
As a parent, have you ever found yourself:
If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you're not alone. These are just some of the hilarious things that every parent experiences at some point or another. But why do we find these moments so funny? As Chatfield and Dooley point out in their book, it's because they're relatable and universal. Every parent can relate to the struggles and joys of raising children, and that's what makes the humor so enjoyable.
If you need more proof that parenting can be downright hilarious, here are some quantifiable examples:
These statistics prove that parenting can be messy, chaotic, and downright hilarious at times. But despite the challenges, we wouldn't trade it for the world.
As a parent myself, I can relate to many of the experiences shared in Chatfield and Dooley's book. One funny moment that stands out to me is when my daughter was learning to talk, she couldn't say "spaghetti" correctly and instead said "pasketti". It was so adorable and hilarious that we still refer to it that way today.
Another moment that stands out is when my son was a baby and had a blowout diaper in a public place. As I was cleaning him up with baby wipes, I accidentally got some poop on my shirt. It was embarrassing at the time, but looking back on it now, it's a funny memory that we all still laugh about.
If you're a new parent or soon-to-be parent, here are some practical tips to keep in mind:
