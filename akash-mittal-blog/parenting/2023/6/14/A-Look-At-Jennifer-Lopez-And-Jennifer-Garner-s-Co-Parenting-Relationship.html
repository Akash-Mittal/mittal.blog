    <h2>From Rivalry To Friendship</h2>
    <p>It's not every day that you hear about two ex-wives of the same man becoming friends and co-parents, but Jennifer Lopez and Jennifer Garner managed to do just that. Their relationship began when Garner was married to Ben Affleck, who later dated and got engaged to Lopez in 2002. However, when Affleck and Lopez's relationship ended in 2004, Garner was there to support him during a difficult time.</p>
    <p>Fast forward a few years later, Affleck and Garner got divorced in 2018 after a decade of marriage, but they remained committed to co-parenting their three children. It was during this time that Lopez and Affleck reconnected and started dating again. As a result, Lopez and Garner's paths were bound to cross, and it didn't take long for them to realize that they had a lot in common.</p>
    <p>The two women bonded over their shared experiences of raising children, managing busy careers, and navigating the challenges of blended families. They found that they could lean on each other for support and advice, and that their children could benefit from having more positive role models in their lives. Today, Lopez and Garner are close friends who even take family vacations together.</p>

    <h2>Co-Parenting Done Right</h2>
    <p>One of the most remarkable things about Lopez and Garner's co-parenting relationship is how well they manage to put their children's needs first. Despite the complicated dynamics of having step-siblings and co-parenting with an ex-spouse's new partner, they have found a way to make it work.</p>
    <p>For example, when Lopez's twins Max and Emme were celebrating their birthday last year, Garner was there to help them blow out the candles. And when Garner's son Samuel had a karate tournament, Lopez was there to cheer him on. They make a point of attending each other's children's events and creating a sense of unity among their blended family.</p>
    <p>Lopez and Garner also communicate regularly about their children's schedules and needs. They coordinate drop-offs and pickups, share information about school and extracurricular activities, and make sure that everyone is on the same page when it comes to parenting decisions. They recognize that it takes a village to raise children, and they're committed to being part of each other's village.</p>
