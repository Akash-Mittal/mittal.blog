   <p>It was a typical Saturday morning for the Johnson family. The kids were watching <em>Frozen</em> for the umpteenth time, when suddenly, the parents realized something.</p>
   <p>The characters Anna and Elsa were teaching their daughters why it's important to communicate with each other, even when they disagree. The Johnsons were struck by the sneaky messaging - Disney was teaching valuable life lessons through its movies, and not just to kids, but to parents as well.</p>
   <h2> Disney Parenting</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Mothers have praised <em>Inside Out</em> for helping them explain the concept of emotions to their children.</li>
    <li>Father's have turned to <em>Toy Story</em> to explain the importance of teamwork, with Woody and Buzz serving as role models of healthy friendship.</li>
    <li>Parents of children with disabilities have praised <em>Finding Nemo</em> for its portrayal of a father's unwavering love and dedication to his son.</li>
    <li>In a survey conducted by Parents Magazine, 75% of respondents reported using Disney movies as a way to teach their children life lessons or values.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Why Disney Works</h2>
   <p>Disney's success in this area isn't by accident. The company has always placed a high value on storytelling and creating characters that resonate with audiences. The movies often feature relatable situations and emotions, making them easy for both kids and adults to connect with on a personal level. Furthermore, unlike other forms of media, Disney movies are often watched as a family, allowing parents to watch alongside their children and use the films as a source of discussion and teachable moments.</p>
