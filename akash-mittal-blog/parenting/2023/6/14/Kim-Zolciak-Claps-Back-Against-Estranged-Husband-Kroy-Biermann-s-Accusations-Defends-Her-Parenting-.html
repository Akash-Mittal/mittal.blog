   <p>Divorces can be messy. It's safe to say that former 'Real Housewives Of Atlanta' star Kim Zolciak is currently experiencing one. The reality star has been vocal about her ongoing divorce with Kroy Biermann, who she was married to for over a decade. In recent court documents, Kroy accused Kim of being an absentee mother to their four children, among other things.</p>
   <p>Kim, however, isn't taking these accusations sitting down. She took to social media to defend herself and her parenting, claiming that she's been the primary caregiver for their children throughout their marriage. Kim also pointed out that Kroy has chosen to spend more time on his football career than with their children, and that she's the one who makes sure they have everything they need.</p>
   <p>But is it enough to just defend yourself and your actions? As a parent going through a divorce, it's important to make sure that you're doing everything you can to ensure your children are thriving in spite of the turmoil. Here are three practical tips for co-parenting during a messy divorce:</p>
   <h2>1. Keep Communication Lines Open</h2>
   <p>It can be easy to let emotions get in the way of effective communication, but it's important to try. Keeping the lines of communication open with your ex-spouse ensures that your children's needs are being met, and that no important information is getting lost in translation. It may not be easy, but try to keep it civil.</p>
   <h2>2. Prioritize Your Children's Well-Being</h2>
   <p>During a divorce, it's easy to get caught up in the minutiae of property division, alimony, and child support. But it's important to remember that your children must be your number one priority. They need both parents to be active participants in their lives, even if it means putting personal feelings aside. Make sure you're putting their well-being first, always.</p>
   <h2>3. Seek Professional Help If Necessary</h2>
   <p>Divorce is difficult, and dealing with co-parenting can be even harder. If you find that you're struggling to keep things together, don't be afraid to seek help from a qualified professional. This could be a mediator, a therapist, or a family counselor. Remember, you don't have to go through this alone.</p>
   <p>Divorce is never easy, but it's important to remember that you're not alone. There are resources available to help you navigate the process and ensure that your children are happy and healthy.</p>
