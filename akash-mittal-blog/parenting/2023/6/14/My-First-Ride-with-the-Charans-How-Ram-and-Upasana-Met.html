  <p>Eleven years ago, Upasana Kamineni was at a mutual friend's wedding when she spotted Ram Charan from across the room. "I thought, 'Wow, he's really cute and tall,'" Upasana recounted in an interview. "But I had no clue who he was."</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Later that night, they sat next to each other on the bus ride to a sangeet ceremony. Ram was checking out her playlist, and Upasana was trying not to act too starstruck. As the night went on, they talked about everything from their love for Hyderabad (more on that later) to their shared passion for fitness.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>It wasn't until Ram got off the bus that Upasana realized he was a famous actor. "I was like, 'Oh my god, I'm such a dipshit,''" she joked. But by then, they had exchanged numbers and made plans to meet up the next day.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>They went on a bike ride around the city, stopping for breakfast at one of Ram's favorite spots. "He was really sweet and chivalrous," Upasana remembered. "I just felt really comfortable around him."</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>That night, at a dinner with friends, Ram asked her to be his partner for life. Upasana couldn't believe it. "I thought it was a joke at first," she said. "But he was serious."</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Just a few months later, they were engaged, and in 2012, they tied the knot in a lavish ceremony in Hyderabad. Today, they are one of the most beloved couples in Tollywood, with a devoted fan base and a happy marriage that has lasted over a decade.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable Examples</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Ram and Upasana's relationship is built on several key pillars: love, respect, and a shared vision for their future. Here are a few quantifiable examples of how they have put those values into practice:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Fitness Goals: Ram and Upasana are both fitness enthusiasts, and they often work out together. In fact, they once ran an entire marathon side by side, finishing in just over four hours. "We have a mutual respect for each other's health and fitness," Upasana said. "It's a big part of our lives and our relationship."</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Philanthropy: As the Vice Chairman of the Apollo Foundation, Upasana has made it her mission to improve healthcare in India. Ram has also been a staunch supporter of various charities over the years, including Teach for Change and the Indian Red Cross Society.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Parenting: They were blessed with a baby boy, and they are set to welcome their second baby next month. They have been very vocal about their parenting philosophy, which emphasizes communication, education, and empathy. "We want to raise our children to be compassionate and conscious human beings," Ram said. "That's more important to us than anything else."</p>
