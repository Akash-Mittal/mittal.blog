  <p>It's a common sight these days - parents engrossed in their phones, scrolling through their social media feeds or replying to messages, while their children vie for their attention. While we are all guilty of this to some extent, a new parenting trend called ‘phubbing' is causing concern among child psychologists and parenting experts.</p>
  <h2>What is ‘Phubbing'?</h2>
  <p>The term ‘phubbing' is a combination of the words ‘phone' and ‘snubbing'. It refers to ignoring someone in favour of your phone. Phubbing is a growing concern worldwide, with the UK being one of the countries where it's most prevalent among parents. When parents frequently ignore their children in favour of their phones, it can have a negative impact on the children's self-esteem and emotional development.</p>
  
  <p>A survey conducted by Common Sense Media found that 56% of American parents admitted to checking their phones while driving with their children. Another survey by the website Your Modern Family found that 75% of their readers felt that phubbing was a major problem in their households.</p>
  <p>Psychologists have also found a connection between phubbing and the increasing rates of teenage depression and anxiety. A study published in the journal Computers in Human Behavior concluded that excessive phone use contributed to feelings of loneliness and depression in teenagers.</p>
  <h2>The Impact on Children</h2>
  <p>When parents are constantly distracted by their phones, it can have a negative impact on their children's emotional wellbeing. Children often feel neglected, unimportant and undervalued when their parents are focused on their phones instead of on them. This can lead to feelings of low self-esteem, anxiety and depression.</p>
  <p>In the long term, phubbing can also affect children's development, particularly in terms of social skills. If children are used to their parents being distracted by their phones, they may lack the social skills necessary to form meaningful relationships with others.</p>
  <h2>What Can Parents Do?</h2>
  <p>The good news is that phubbing is a habit that can be broken. Here are some practical tips for parents:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Set boundaries: Set aside designated phone-free time to spend with your children, such as during meals or family outings.</li>
   <li>Lead by example: Put your phone away when spending time with your children, and avoid checking it while driving.</li>
   <li>Show your children that they are valued: Make eye contact and actively listen to your children when they speak to you, instead of being distracted by your phone.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>‘Phubbing' may seem like a harmless trend, but the consequences of ignoring your children in favour of your phone can be significant. By practicing mindfulness and setting boundaries, we can break the habit of phubbing and ensure we are giving our children the attention and support they need.</p><em>References:</em>
