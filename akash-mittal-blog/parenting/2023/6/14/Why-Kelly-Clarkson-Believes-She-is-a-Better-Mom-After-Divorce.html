   <p>Being a parent is hard. Being a divorced parent is even harder. But for Kelly Clarkson, divorce has actually made her a better mom. In a recent episode of Glennon Doyle's podcast, "We Can Do Hard Things," the singer opened up about how her divorce has changed her approach to parenting.</p>
   <h2>Kelly's Divorce and Parenting Transformation</h2>
   <p>Kelly Clarkson revealed that after her divorce, she became more intentional about what was important to her and her children. This meant prioritizing her mental health, setting boundaries, and being more present with her children. Here are some quantifiable examples that demonstrate Kelly's transformation:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Before her divorce, Kelly would work for 16-18 hours per day, which left little time for her children. As a result, they became accustomed to seeing their mom stressed and exhausted. After her divorce, Kelly made a conscious effort to prioritize her mental health and set boundaries. She now limits her work hours to eight hours a day and schedules in at least an hour a day to take care of her mental health. This has resulted in her children seeing a happier, more present mom.</li>
    <li>Before her divorce, Kelly struggled with anxiety and depression but was hesitant to seek help. After her divorce, she realized the importance of taking care of her mental health and began therapy. This has allowed her to become more emotionally stable, which has had a positive impact on her parenting.</li>
    <li>Before her divorce, Kelly was always on the go and rarely took time to connect with her children. After her divorce, she made a conscious effort to be more present and engage in activities with her children. She now prioritizes family time and enjoys doing simple things like watching movies and going on walks with her children.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
   <p>Kelly's story demonstrates the importance of prioritizing mental health and being intentional about parenting. But she's not alone in her struggle. Many divorced parents struggle with finding a balance between their work, personal life, and parenting responsibilities. Here are some personal anecdotes and case studies that illustrate this struggle:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Amy, a single mom of two, struggled with depression and anxiety after her divorce. She felt guilty about working full-time while her children were in daycare, but couldn't afford to cut back on her hours. Eventually, she sought help from a therapist and learned how to set boundaries and prioritize self-care, which had a positive impact on her parenting.</li>
    <li>Tim, a divorced dad of three, struggled with feeling like he was missing out on important moments in his children's lives. He would work long hours to provide for his family but felt like he wasn't present enough. After talking to other divorced parents, he realized he wasn't alone in his struggle. He began setting aside more time for family activities and made a conscious effort to be more present.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Practical Tips for Divorced Parents</h2>
   <p>If you're a divorced parent struggling to find a balance between work, personal life, and parenting responsibilities, here are some practical tips:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Set boundaries: It's important to prioritize your mental health and set boundaries with work and personal obligations. This might mean limiting your work hours, scheduling in time for self-care, or saying no to social invitations.</li>
    <li>Be intentional about family time: Make a conscious effort to prioritize family time and engage in activities with your children. This doesn't have to be expensive or elaborate - even simple things like family dinners, movie nights, and game nights can go a long way.</li>
    <li>Seek support: Don't be afraid to seek help from a therapist or support group. Divorce is a difficult experience, and it's important to have a safe space to talk about your feelings and get support.</li>
   </ul>
