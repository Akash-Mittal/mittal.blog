    <h3>Practical Tips and Strategies</h3>

     <li>Communicate clearly and consistently. Use a shared calendar or app to keep track of important dates, and establish guidelines for how you'll communicate about your child's needs.</li>
     <li>Stay flexible and open-minded. Co-parenting can be challenging, but it's important to remain flexible and open to new solutions if things aren't working out.</li>
