    <p>As a parent, I always thought that I knew exactly what I was doing. But over the years, I have realized that parenting is not a linear journey. It evolves with each passing year and each milestone that your child achieves. And for me, the realization of this evolution came when my daughter turned 19.</p>
    <p>Up until that point, I had followed a certain set of guidelines that I believed to be the fundamental principles of parenting. But as time went on, I began to question those principles and started to make changes that I felt were necessary for my daughter to become a responsible, independent adult.</p>
    <h3>Living in the Age of Technology</h3>
    <p>As a parent, I am acutely aware of the impact of technology on our children. In today's age, it is impossible to keep them away from it, and we have to learn to embrace it. I have noticed that my daughter communicates more through her phone than face-to-face, which made me concerned about her social skills. However, I realized that this is how she is comfortable communicating and it is important to adapt to that.</p>
    <p>So, I started to incorporate more digital communication with her, such as sharing articles of mutual interest and joining in on online gaming sessions. As a result, it has improved my relationship with her and I have also learned to appreciate the positive effects technology can have on communication.</p>
    <h3>Education in a Changing World</h3>
    <p>The world we live in is constantly changing, and our children need to be equipped with the right skills and knowledge to adapt. I realized that my daughter's education should reflect this notion of adaptability. Instead of simply emphasizing academic excellence, I placed a greater emphasis on life skills, such as critical thinking, problem-solving and communication.</p>
    <p>For example, I encouraged her to take up internships and volunteer work, where she would directly apply her knowledge and skills in practical settings. I also helped her develop her public speaking skills, which has come in handy in her academic pursuits and will be invaluable in her professional life.</p>
    <h3>Empowering Independence</h3>
    <p>As my daughter grew older, it became increasingly apparent that she needed to become more independent. I wanted her to be able to take care of herself, both emotionally and practically. I realized that I couldn't just keep 'protecting' her, no matter how much I wanted to. As she started college, I realized that I needed to give her space to make decisions on her own, as hard as that was for me.</p>
    <p>So, I started to involve her more in decision-making, whether it was related to finances, academics or personal matters. I wanted her to start taking ownership of her life, and that meant allowing her to make mistakes and learn from them. It has been a difficult process, but I have seen the positive impact it has had on her growth and development.</p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>In conclusion, parenting is an ever-evolving process. What worked when our kids were young may not work when they grow older. It is important to recognize this evolution and adapt our parenting style to suit the changing needs of our children. As a result of these changes, I have seen my daughter grow into a responsible, independent adult who is ready to take on the world.</p>
