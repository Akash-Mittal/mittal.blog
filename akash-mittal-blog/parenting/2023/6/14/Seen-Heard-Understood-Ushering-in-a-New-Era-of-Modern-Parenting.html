   <p>When was the last time you had a meaningful conversation with your teenager?</p>
   <p>According to a recent study, only 16% of parents reported talking to their teens daily about things that matter. This lack of communication leaves many teens feeling disconnected and misunderstood.</p>
   <p>Lainie Liberti, a parenting expert and author, wants to change this and create a new era of modern parenting where parents equip, empower, and encourage teens in these tumultuous times. With her new book, 'Seen, Heard &amp; Understood - Parenting and Partnering with Teens for Greater Mental Health', she provides practical tips, personal anecdotes, and case studies to help parents connect with their teens and promote better mental health.</p>
   <h3>An :</h3>
   <p>The title of Lainie's book is magnetic and eye-catching. It promises a solution to a common problem that many parents face â€“ not being able to communicate effectively with their teens. The title also suggests that teens will be heard and understood, which is something they crave, but often don't receive from their parents.</p>
   <h3>Quantifiable Examples:</h3>
   <p>Lainie's book is full of quantifiable examples that bring to life the challenges and solutions of parenting a teenager. For instance, she highlights a study that found that 3 out of 4 teens face anxiety and depression, and a staggering 20% of teens will experience major depression before they reach adulthood. Lainie also provides parents with practical tips on how to communicate effectively with their teens and promote better mental health. One such tip is to listen actively and without judgment, which can increase trust and communication.</p>
   <h3> and Case Studies:</h3>
   <p>Lainie's book is filled with personal anecdotes and case studies that illustrate her points and make them relatable. She shares stories of real-life parents and teens who have faced and overcome challenges, such as gender identity, substance abuse, and mental health issues. These stories show that other families have been through tough times and come out stronger on the other side. They also provide practical tips on how to help your teen navigate difficult situations.</p>
