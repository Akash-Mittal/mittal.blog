   <p>Understanding the people pleasing tendency and how to work around it.</p>
  </header>
  <main>
   
   <p>As a new mom, I found myself constantly worrying about what others would think of my parenting decisions. I wanted everyone to view me as a perfect mother, and I often sacrificed my own needs and desires to please others. It wasn't until I started experiencing burnout and my child's needs were not being met that I realized my people-pleasing tendencies were not only harmful to myself but also to my child.</p>
   
   <p>According to a study conducted by the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, people-pleasing behavior often results in higher levels of stress and anxiety, leading to lower job performance and decreased job satisfaction. In the context of parenting, people-pleasers are more likely to neglect their child's needs in order to please others, resulting in negative impacts on both the parent's and the child's emotional health.</p>

   <p>Parenting with People-Pleasing: A Harmful Tendency</p>
   <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
   <p>I personally struggled with the people-pleasing tendency in my parenting journey. It wasn't until I sought help from a therapist that I learned how to set healthy boundaries and prioritize my child's needs over others' expectations. Additionally, a case study published in Family Therapy Magazine highlighted the negative impact of people-pleasing behaviors on family dynamics, particularly in the areas of communication and decision-making.</p>

    <li>Practice saying "no" to requests that do not align with your priorities or values.</li>
    <li>Seek support from a therapist or support group to better understand your people-pleasing tendencies and how to work around them.</li>
    <li>Focus on building healthy communication and decision-making skills within your family to prioritize everyone's needs and desires.</li>
   </ol>
