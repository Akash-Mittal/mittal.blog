  <p></p>
  <p>Introduction:</p>
  <p>As the sun sets on a summer evening in Missouri, Samantha sits on her porch with her son, Tyler. Samantha had fled an abusive relationship with Tyler's father a year ago, and the court had granted her sole custody. But with the new legislation passed in Missouri, Samantha fears that she might lose the protection she had fought so hard to secure for her son.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable Examples:</p>
  <p>According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, one in three women and one in four men have experienced some form of physical violence by an intimate partner. In cases where child custody is shared, children are more likely to experience ongoing abuse, leading to long-lasting emotional and psychological trauma. Additionally, research shows that child custody arrangements that favor abusive parents result in the death of children.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The Threat to Abuse Survivors:</p>
  <p>The recently passed legislation in Missouri requires judges to start each child custody case with the presumption that "equal or approximately equal" parenting time for each parent is in the child's best interests. While this might seem fair and just on the surface, experts in the field of domestic violence argue that it could be a potential disaster for survivors of abuse and their children. Abusers often use child custody as a means of exerting control and intimidation over their partners. Giving them equal or shared custody could give them more opportunities to do so and threaten the safety and well-being of the children.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>:</p>
  <p>Samantha's story is not unique. Many abuse survivors like her, who had already been granted sole custody, fear that they may have to fight the court again just to remain safe. The new legislation may also act as a deterrent for survivors who are considering leaving abusive partners, as they may not want to risk losing custody of their children or getting into legal battles that could further traumatize them.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion:</p>
  <p>The 50/50 child custody law passed in Missouri raises serious concerns about the safety of abuse survivors and their children. It could potentially expose them to further harm and make it harder for them to protect themselves and their children from their abusers. Judges need to consider the unique circumstances of each case and not impose a one-size-fits-all approach. Abuse survivors need to be protected and their rights to safety and security must be taken into consideration.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Practical Tips:</p>
  <p>If you are a survivor of abuse and facing a child custody battle, seek help from domestic violence organizations and attorneys who specialize in domestic violence cases. Keep a record of all communications and interactions with your partner and document any abuse or threats of abuse. Get therapy for yourself and your child to help cope with trauma.</p>
