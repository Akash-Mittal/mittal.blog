    <p>When I was a teenager, I got caught smoking by my mom. She was furious and disappointed, and she made me promise to never do it again. I felt ashamed and guilty, but as soon as I had the chance, I lit up another cigarette. Smoking became a habit that lasted for years, and I regretted it every time I coughed or smelled like an ashtray.</p>
    <p>Now, as a parent, I can't help but wonder: what if my kids make the same mistake I did? What if they ignore my warnings and give in to peer pressure? What if they get addicted and suffer the consequences? I don't want to be like my mom, who felt like she failed to protect me from harm, but I also don't want to be too strict or controlling. I want my kids to learn from their mistakes, but I don't want them to make irreversible ones.</p>
    <p>That's why I was touched and inspired by the recent conversation between Drew Barrymore and P!nk on "The Drew Barrymore Show." They both opened up about their own struggles and how they cope with the fear of their kids repeating them.</p>

    <p>To put things into perspective, here are some statistics and facts that show how common and harmful some mistakes can be:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Alcohol and drug use: According to the 2020 Monitoring the Future survey, 37% of 12th graders reported drinking alcohol in the past month, and 19% reported using marijuana. In addition, the National Institute on Drug Abuse reports that drug use can lead to addiction, overdose, mental health problems, and social consequences.</li>
     <li>Distracted driving: In 2019, distracted driving caused 2,841 deaths in the US, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The main culprits were texting, talking on the phone, and using apps while behind the wheel.</li>
     <li>Bullying and cyberbullying: The National Center for Education Statistics reports that 20% of students aged 12-18 experienced bullying in 2019, either in person or online. The effects of bullying can include lower academic achievement, anxiety, depression, and suicide.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are just a few examples, but they illustrate the importance of addressing and preventing harmful behaviors in kids.</p>

    <h2>Practical Tips and </h2>
    <p>Drew and P!nk had some insightful and relatable advice for parents who are struggling with the fear of their kids making the same mistakes they did. Here are some highlights:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Talk openly and without judgment: Drew emphasized the importance of having honest and non-threatening conversations with her kids, where they can share their feelings and thoughts without fearing punishment or anger. She also acknowledged that parents need to be vulnerable and admit their own flaws and mistakes.</li>
     <li>Set clear boundaries and consequences: P!nk shared how she struggled with addiction and self-harm, and how she had to learn to set boundaries for herself and stick to them. She applied the same principle to her parenting, where she explained to her kids what behaviors were acceptable and unacceptable, and what the consequences would be if they crossed the line.</li>
     <li>Be present and supportive: Both Drew and P!nk talked about how important it was for them to show up for their kids, physically and emotionally. They didn't want to be absent or distracted, and they wanted to be a source of comfort and guidance for their kids. They also acknowledged that parenting was hard, and that they needed to take care of themselves as well.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As a parent myself, I can relate to these tips and also share some personal anecdotes:</p>
    <p>When my daughter was in middle school, she became friends with a group of girls who were involved in some risky behaviors, such as skipping school, smoking, and drinking. I was worried and upset, but I didn't want to impose my own values or forbid her from seeing her friends. Instead, I tried to listen to her and understand her perspective. I also talked to the school counselor and other parents, and we decided to organize a parent-teen workshop where we could discuss the risks and consequences of those behaviors. It was eye-opening and empowering for everyone, and it helped my daughter and her friends make better choices.</p>
    <p>Another example involves my son, who is a teenager and has ADHD. He struggles with impulsivity and distraction, and he sometimes forgets to take his medication. One day, he came home from school with a speeding ticket, and I was furious and scared. I didn't want him to get hurt or hurt others, and I felt like I had failed as a parent. However, instead of yelling or punishing him, I took a deep breath and asked him what happened. He told me that he was in a rush to get home and play video games, and that he didn't realize how fast he was going. I told him that I understood his frustration and his condition, but that he needed to be responsible and mindful when behind the wheel. We also agreed to set reminders and check-ins to make sure he took his medication regularly.</p>
