  <p>It was a typical night for Samantha and her family. Her teenage son, Jake, was scrolling through his phone before bedtime when she noticed him giggling at something on social media. As she got closer, she saw that he was watching a video of young women dancing provocatively.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Samantha couldn't help but feel uneasy about what her son was watching. She wondered if he was aware of the messages this kind of content sends about women and their worth. She also wondered if she was being too sensitive.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This scenario is not uncommon in today's digital age. With smartphones and social media being an integral part of our daily lives, parents are faced with the challenge of monitoring their children's online activities. The issue of explicit content is a particular concern, as young people are exposed to it at an alarming rate.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>What's more concerning, however, is the double standard that exists between young men and women when it comes to this content. Boys are often encouraged to indulge in sexually explicit material as a "rite of passage", while girls are shamed and judged for doing the same.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This was the topic of discussion on the latest episode of Parental Guidance TV Show. The group of parents talked about the damaging effects of this double standard and how it perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>But this is just the tip of the iceberg. The show also introduced four new parenting styles that reflect the changing times. The Team Parenting style focuses on collaboration and shared goals, while Spiritual Parenting puts emphasis on faith and spirituality. The Influencer Parenting style uses social media to connect with and influence their children, and Stage Parenting focuses on nurturing their children's talents and passions.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>While these parenting styles may seem different from each other, they all have one thing in common: the need for parents to adapt to new challenges in the digital era.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>So, what can parents do to tackle the issue of explicit content and gender stereotypes? Here are three practical tips:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Educate yourself and your child about the harmful effects of explicit material and how it promotes unhealthy attitudes towards women.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Have open and honest conversations with your child about their online activity. Don't shy away from discussing sensitive topics and encourage them to come to you with any concerns.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Be an active participant in your child's online life. Friend them on social media, monitor their activity, and set limits and boundaries when needed.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>By taking these steps, parents can help their children navigate the complex and ever-changing world of social media and online content.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, the issue of explicit content and gender stereotypes is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach. By being informed and proactive, parents can play a crucial role in shaping their child's online experience and promoting healthy attitudes towards gender and sexuality.</p>
