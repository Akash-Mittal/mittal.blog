    <h2>An Eye-Opening Story of Co-Parenting Success</h2>
    <p>Picture this: two famous actresses, both with busy schedules and public lives, both once married and now divorced, both raising children with their exes. It may sound like a recipe for disaster, but for Jennifer Garner and Sheryl Lee Ralph, it's a recipe for success.</p>
    <p>Jennifer and Sheryl recently sat down for an interview to discuss the importance of co-parenting with exes for the sake of their children. Both women emphasized the need to put aside any personal feelings and prioritize the well-being of their kids.</p>
    <h2> Co-Parenting Success</h2>
    <p>Jennifer and Sheryl's approach to co-parenting has yielded some impressive results. Here are just a few examples:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Despite their divorce, Jennifer and her ex-husband Ben Affleck have remained close and continue to co-parent their three children together. They even go on family vacations together and attend each other's important events.</li>
     <li>Sheryl and her ex-husband Eric Maurice have been able to successfully co-parent their son Etienne, who is now a successful musician. In fact, Eric still manages Etienne's music career.</li>
     <li>Both Jennifer and Sheryl have emphasized the importance of maintaining a positive relationship with their exes' new partners, as this can have a significant impact on the kids. Jennifer has even expressed admiration for Ben's new girlfriend, Ana de Armas.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> and Tips for Successful Co-Parenting Relationships</h2>
    <p>In addition to sharing their success stories, Jennifer and Sheryl offered some personal anecdotes and tips for others who may be struggling with co-parenting with exes. Here are a few key takeaways from their interview:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Communication is key. Jennifer emphasized the need to communicate openly and honestly with your ex-partner about your children's needs and schedules. This can help prevent misunderstandings and conflicts down the line.</li>
     <li>Put your kids first. Sheryl stressed the importance of always putting your children's needs first, even if it means putting aside your own feelings or desires. This may require some sacrifices, but it's important for your children's well-being.</li>
     <li>Be flexible. Co-parenting requires a certain degree of flexibility and compromise. Sheryl shared that she and her ex-husband have a shared Google calendar where they can easily coordinate Etienne's schedule. Jennifer, on the other hand, emphasized the need to be flexible with your ex's schedule and to be willing to step in if they can't make it to an important event.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion: Co-Parenting Success in Three Points</h2>
    <p>In summary, here are three key points to keep in mind when co-parenting with exes:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Put your kids first and prioritize their well-being over any personal feelings or conflicts.</li>
     <li>Communicate openly and honestly with your ex-partner to avoid misunderstandings or conflicts.</li>
     <li>Be flexible and willing to compromise in order to create a schedule and arrangement that works best for your family.</li>
