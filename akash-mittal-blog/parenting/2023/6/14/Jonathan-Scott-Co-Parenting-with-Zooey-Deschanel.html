   <h2>How the Property Brothers Star is Growing Closer with His Step-Children</h2>
  </header>
  <section>
   <p>Jonathan Scott, one half of HGTV's famous â€˜Property Brothers' duo, has been in a relationship with actress Zooey Deschanel since 2019. Recently, Jonathan has opened up about his experience co-parenting with Zooey and how he is building a strong relationship with her two children from her previous marriage, daughter Elsie and son Charlie.</p>
   <p>Jonathan admits that at first it was a little intimidating to step into a parental role with two children he had only just met. However, he quickly realized that it's all about building a meaningful connection. He says, "I just make sure that I'm there for them and that they have someone they can lean on whenever they need it."</p>
   <p>One way that Jonathan is building a bond with Elsie and Charlie is by spending quality time with them doing things they enjoy. Together, they've made crafts, played games, and even built forts. Jonathan says, "It's really important to find ways to connect with each child individually and bond over common interests."</p>
   <ul>
    <li>According to a study published in the Journal of Marriage and Family, spending quality time with stepchildren is one of the most effective ways to establish a strong relationship with them.</li>
    <li>Jonathan also recognizes the importance of not forcing the relationship and letting it develop at its own pace. He believes that trust needs to be earned and that it takes time for children to feel comfortable with a new parent figure.</li>
    <li>Additionally, Jonathan makes an effort to show an interest in what Elsie and Charlie are doing and to be available when they need him. He says, "I think the more you show them that you care and that you're listening, the more they'll open up to you."</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Overall, Jonathan has found co-parenting to be a rewarding experience that has brought him closer to Zooey's children. He says, "It's been amazing to watch their personalities emerge and to be a part of their growth and development."</p>
   <p>If you're in a similar situation and looking for ways to build a strong relationship with stepchildren, remember to:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Find ways to spend quality time with each child individually.</li>
    <li>Let the relationship develop naturally and don't force it.</li>
    <li>Be available and show an interest in what they're doing.</li>
   </ul>
