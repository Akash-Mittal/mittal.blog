  <p>It was a sunny day in Johannesburg when Annelisa found out she was pregnant. She was overjoyed; finally, she was going to be a mom.</p>
  <p>But soon, Annelisa began to realize that motherhood wasn't going to be as easy as she thought. Her baby, Siyabonga, was born with a cleft lip and palate. Annelisa had never even heard of this condition before, and she was terrified.</p>
  <p>But Annelisa was determined to help her son. She searched for resources online and found UNICEF's information on cleft lip and palate. Through UNICEF, she was able to connect with other parents of children with the same condition, and she learned about the surgery that could fix Siyabonga's cleft lip and palate.</p>
  <p>With the help of UNICEF, Annelisa was able to get Siyabonga the surgery he needed. She was amazed by the transformation in her son's appearance and the impact it had on his health and happiness.</p>
  <p>But Annelisa's journey as a mother was far from over. Siyabonga was diagnosed with autism, which presented new challenges for the family. Annelisa had to learn how to help her son communicate and navigate the world around him.</p>
