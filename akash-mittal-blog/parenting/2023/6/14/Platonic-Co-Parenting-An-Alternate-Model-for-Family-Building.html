    <p>Emily and Matt had been good friends since college. They had always talked about having children, but they both knew that they weren't interested in a romantic relationship. One day, the idea of platonic co-parenting came up in conversation. After lots of discussion, research, and planning, they decided to bring a child into the world together.</p>

    <p>The trend of platonic co-parenting has been on the rise in recent years. According to a survey by Modamily, an elective co-parenting platform, 43% of people who are considering co-parenting are open to a platonic relationship. The same survey found that 78% of platonic co-parenting arrangements do not involve any sexual relationship between the co-parents.</p>
    <p>There are also success stories of platonic co-parenting. In an article by CNN, a couple named Sarah and David shared their experience of raising a child together. Despite having ended their romantic relationship, they were able to maintain a strong friendship as co-parents, and their daughter is thriving in their care.</p>

    <h2>The Benefits of Platonic Co-Parenting</h2>
    <ol>
     <li><strong>Shared Responsibility:</strong> In a platonic co-parenting relationship, both parties share the responsibility of raising the child. They can rely on each other for support, and they can both have an active role in the child's life.</li>
     <li><strong>Financial Benefits:</strong> Co-parents can split the cost of raising a child, which can help alleviate financial strain.</li>
     <li><strong>No Romantic Pressure:</strong> With no romantic relationship involved, both parties can focus on raising the child without the added pressure of trying to make a romantic relationship work.</li>
