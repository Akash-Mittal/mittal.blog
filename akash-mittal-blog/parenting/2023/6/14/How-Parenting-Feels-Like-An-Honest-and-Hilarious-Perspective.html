  <p>When my colleague, Sarah, had her first child, she was overjoyed and ecstatic. But months went by, and she often found herself wondering why she felt so drained, tired, and moody. She felt guilty for not enjoying motherhood 24/7 and thought something must be wrong with her. It wasn't until she read Jason Chatfield and Scott Dooley's new book, "You're Not a Real Parent Until...", that she realized she wasn't alone. Parenting is hard, chaotic, and on most days, hilarious.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Chatfield and Dooley's book is a comical and honest perspective on parenting, where they share relatable stories that only parents will understand. They touch upon numerous topics that make parenting what it is â€“ from sleepless nights, toddler tantrums, potty training, and teenage attitude to the everyday struggle of feeding, keeping them safe, and trying not to lose one's sanity.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Here are three ways Chatfield and Dooley perfectly conveyed what parenting feels like.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. The Emotional Rollercoaster</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>As parents, we often find ourselves on an emotional rollercoaster where we can be happy one minute and crying the next. Chatfield and Dooley perfectly capture this feeling in their cartoons: a dad playing with his child, with the caption "I never knew I could feel so much joy and so much exhaustion at the same time." In another, a mom is lost in thought while scrubbing dishes, with the caption "I'll never get these spaghetti stains out. I'm a terrible mother." These cartoons are relatable because parenting can consume our emotions, making it hard to separate the good days from the bad.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. The Struggle is Real</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Parenting is a full-time job, and there's no such thing as a day off. Chatfield and Dooley hilariously convey this in their cartoons: a dad sleeping while standing, holding his sleeping child with one hand, and stirring his coffee with the other. In another, a mom leisurely lying on the couch, trying to relax, while her child jumps on her stomach. These cartoons demonstrate the constant struggle of finding time for oneself while trying to meet every need of your child's.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. It's Okay to Laugh</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Parenting can be overwhelming, stressful, and even heartbreaking at times. However, Chatfield and Dooley remind us that it's okay to laugh. Their cartoons are relatable, witty, and funny, allowing parents to see the humor in everyday situations. Whether it's a spill, a mispronounced word, or a silly response, these moments can bring joy to the chaos. As Chatfield and Dooley capture perfectly, "It's a good thing kids are so cute. Otherwise, we'd be serving life sentences."</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, parenting is a beautiful and rewarding journey, but it's also one of the hardest. Chatfield and Dooley's book perfectly captures the ups and downs of parenthood, making it an excellent resource for any parent who needs to laugh, cry, and relate. Personal anecdotes and case studies could further supplement this perspective, while practical tips for coping with the challenges of parenting could make this article more actionable.</p>
