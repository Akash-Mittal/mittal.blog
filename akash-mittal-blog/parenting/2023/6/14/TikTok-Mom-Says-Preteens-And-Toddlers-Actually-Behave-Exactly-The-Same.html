  <h1>The Surprising Similarities Between Preteens And Toddlers</h1></br> <img src="images/TikTok-Mom-Says-Preteens-And-Toddlers-Actually-Behave-Exactly-The-Same.jpeg" alt="+TikTok-Mom-Says-Preteens-And-Toddlers-Actually-Behave-Exactly-The-Same+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.scarymommy.com/parenting/teens-toddlers-same-behavior-tiktok" target="_blank" href="https://www.scarymommy.com/parenting/teens-toddlers-same-behavior-tiktok" rel="noopener">https://www.scarymommy.com/parenting/teens-toddlers-same-behavior-tiktok</a></span></h5>
  <p>"Mommy, I don't want to wear this shirt!" yelled my 3-year-old daughter as we were getting ready to go out for a walk. I sighed and realized that I had heard the same complaint from my 12-year-old niece just a few days ago.</p>
  <p>This got me thinking: how similar are the behaviors of preteens and toddlers? As it turns out, TikTok mom and parenting coach, Carolyn Landis, recently made a video that went viral, claiming just that. She set out to prove that preteens and toddlers actually exhibit similar obstinate behaviors.</p>
  <h2>Do Preteens And Toddlers Really Behave The Same?</h2>
  <p>Landis's TikTok video highlights some of the ways that preteens and toddlers behave similarly. For example, both age groups can be stubborn and resistant to change. They can also be prone to tantrums and mood swings.</p>
  <p>Another similarity between preteens and toddlers is their desire for independence. Toddlers want to do everything themselves, and preteens want to be treated like adults. Both age groups can push back against authority figures, whether it's their parents or their teachers.</p>
  
  <p>To further explore the similarities between preteens and toddlers, let's look at some quantifiable examples.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Both age groups may have trouble paying attention and following directions. Toddlers may struggle with activities that require focus, like coloring or building blocks. Preteens may have difficulty staying on task with homework or chores.</li>
   <li>Both age groups can be moody and emotional. Toddlers may cry or throw a tantrum when they don't get their way. Preteens may become easily frustrated or angry when they perceive something as unfair.</li>
   <li>Both age groups can be resistant to change. Toddlers may become distressed if their routine is disrupted, like if they have to skip naptime. Preteens may resist changes to their schedule or activities they enjoy.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Practical Tips For Parents</h2>
  <p>Now that we've established some similarities between preteens and toddlers, how can parents manage these behaviors? Here are some practical tips to try:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Set clear boundaries and expectations. This can help both age groups understand what is expected of them and reduce conflicts.</li>
   <li>Allow for independence when appropriate. Giving toddlers choices, like which color shirt to wear, can make them feel more in control. Similarly, allowing preteens to make decisions, like what extracurricular activities to participate in, can help them feel more grown-up.</li>
   <li>Praise good behavior. Both age groups respond well to positive reinforcement. When your toddler or preteen behaves well, make sure to acknowledge it with praise.</li>
   <li>Use consequences when necessary. While we don't want to punish our children, consequences can be helpful when they misbehave. This can include time-outs for toddlers or loss of privileges for preteens.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, preteens and toddlers may exhibit similar behaviors at times. While this can be frustrating for parents, it's important to recognize that these behaviors are age-appropriate and can be managed with patience and understanding. By setting clear expectations, allowing for independence, and using positive reinforcement, parents can help their children navigate these challenging moments.</p>
