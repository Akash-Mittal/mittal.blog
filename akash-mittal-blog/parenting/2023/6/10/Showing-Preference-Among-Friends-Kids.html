   <p>Have you ever been in a situation where you find yourself showing preference among your friends' kids? It's not uncommon for parents to have a favorite child, but it becomes a bigger issue when that favoritism extends beyond their own family.</p>
   <h2>The Story of Lily and Emma</h2>
   <p>Lily and Emma were two five-year-old girls in the same kindergarten class. They were both well-behaved and friendly, but Lily's mother had a soft spot for her. She would often bring Lily gifts and treats, and would go out of her way to make sure Lily was included in activities. On the other hand, Emma was often left out and felt ignored and rejected. It didn't take long for the other parents to notice the favoritism, and tensions started to build among the group.</p>
   
   <p>Research shows that parental favoritism is more common than we might think. According to a study published in the Journal of Marriage and Family, 75% of mothers and 50% of fathers have a favorite child. Another study found that favoritism can have negative impacts on the relationships between siblings, causing rivalry and resentment.</p>
   <h3>Practical Tips</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Be aware of your own biases and try to treat all kids equally</li>
    <li>Acknowledge and praise each child's unique strengths and accomplishments</li>
    <li>Encourage all kids to participate and feel included in activities</li>
    <li>Avoid giving special treatment or favoritism to any one child</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, showing preference among friends' kids can cause unnecessary tension and resentment among parents and children alike. By being aware of our own biases and treating all kids equally, we can help create a supportive and positive environment for all the children in our lives.</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Be aware of your own biases</li>
    <li>Acknowledge each child's unique strengths</li>
    <li>Encourage inclusion for all kids</li>
   </ol>
   
   <p>When I was growing up, my mother had a tendency to show favoritism towards my younger brother. She would often give him special treatment and let him get away with things she wouldn't let me do. It caused a lot of tension between us and affected our relationship. As an adult, I've made a conscious effort to treat all the kids in my life equally and avoid making the same mistakes my mother did.</p>
