  <h1>The Snowsuit Dilemma</h1></br> <img src="images/Breaking-the-Cycle-Ending-Society-s-Anti-Fat-Bias-and-Promoting-Healthy-Eating-Habits.jpeg" alt="+Breaking-the-Cycle-Ending-Society-s-Anti-Fat-Bias-and-Promoting-Healthy-Eating-Habits+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.kcrw.com/culture/shows/good-food/diet-culture-parenting-sri-lankan-cuisine-farmland-water" target="_blank" href="https://www.kcrw.com/culture/shows/good-food/diet-culture-parenting-sri-lankan-cuisine-farmland-water" rel="noopener">https://www.kcrw.com/culture/shows/good-food/diet-culture-parenting-sri-lankan-cuisine-farmland-water</a></span></h5>
  <p>It was a cold winter day and I needed to put my toddler daughter in her snowsuit to head outside. As I zipped up her suit, I noticed the extra fabric around her legs and arms. Concerned about her being too warm, I decided to take her to the doctor to ensure she was properly protected from the cold. The doctor took one look at her and said that she had put on too much weight. At that moment, I realized how much our society was biased against anyone who wasn't thin.</p>
  <p>My daughter wasn't even overweight, but the doctor had immediately assumed that her extra clothing meant she was carrying extra pounds. This incident made me realize how deeply ingrained our anti-fat bias was and how it affected our children's health. Pediatricians were no longer just assessing a child's physical health but instead were policing a child's weight, which often led to detrimental body image and unhealthy eating habits.</p>
  <h2>The Problem with Childhood Obesity</h2>
  <p>Childhood obesity has been on the rise for decades, and it's not just a problem in the United States. According to the World Health Organization, the prevalence of children overweight and obese increased from 4% to 6% in low-income countries and from 10% to 13% in high-income countries between 1990 and 2016. This increase is alarming because overweight and obese children are more likely to suffer from chronic diseases such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease, now and in their future adult life.</p>
  <p>Despite this increased prevalence, the solution for childhood obesity is not as simple as just telling our children to eat less and move more. The root causes of childhood obesity are complex and typically involve community-level influences, social determinants of health, and individual biology. Addressing these factors include financial stability, food deserts, and limited access to physical activity infrastructures like parks, gyms and recreational spaces, and personal eating habits.</p>
  <h2>Sri Lankan Cuisine and Traditional Hoppers</h2>
  <p>Sri Lankan cuisine is a great example of how food culture can make healthy eating an easy and enjoyable habit. Restaurateur Karan Gokani remembers his first time trying hoppers, made of fermented rice and coconut, and other traditional dishes. He found the cuisine flavorful and nutritious while attracting many different tastes and palates. Unlike traditional Western diet cultures of meat-eating and processed food, Sri Lankan meals are primarily plant-based and filled with whole foods. With healthful spices like turmeric, coriander, cumin, and ginger, preparing home-cooked meals to the citizens of the island is easy, delicious, and nutritious.</p>
  <p>Feeding an entire population well is a challenge. But in Sri Lanka, the practice of sharing homemade food with one another is highly valued, which makes it easier to catch healthy behaviors: adults and children alike enjoy the local market and share vegetables and fish dishes with their communities. Neglecting to eat wholesome foods is put down less to personal preference and more about community.</p>
  <h2>Breaking the Cycle</h2>
  <p>In order to combat childhood obesity and the anti-fat bias of our society, we need to address the root causes of unhealthy eating habits. Here are three practical tips I've found to be helpful in making healthy and positive changes:</p>
  <ol>
   <li><strong>Eat Together:</strong> One way to create good habits around food is to make it an enjoyable experience. Eating as a family and in groups can harmonize healthy eating and socializing, thereby encouraging healthier habits together.</li>
   <li><strong>Try new foods:</strong> Experiment with new ethnic cuisine, especially plant-based dishes that are high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Calculate the healthful nutrient value before you prepare it, understanding which foods have more of the healthy things and which ones offer much-need vitamins.</li>
   <li><strong>Go Outside:</strong> Physical activity also plays a critical role in developing healthy habits. Aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity a day and vary the types of exercise, make a plan for local outdoor spaces, and build movement into everyday life like choosing the stairs instead of the elevator.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>As a society, we need to break the cycle of anti-fat bias and promote healthy eating habits that are sustainable and enjoyable. We need to address the root causes of childhood obesity and have open discussions about the social and economic determinants that lead to poor health outcomes.</p>
  <p>By following the practical tips discussed above and embracing cultures that emphasize wholesome foods, we can make healthy eating habits a part of our daily lives, not only for ourselves but for generations to come. With increased emphasis on community, cultural contextualization, and promoting healthy relationships with food and physical activity, health-promoting patterns that reduce weight and increase overall well-being are achievable.</p>
