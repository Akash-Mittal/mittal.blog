   <p>For 17-year-old Kaitlyn, like many of the young mothers living in the small town of Masterton, New Zealand, becoming pregnant at a young age brought about many challenges. She struggled to find support and resources, felt isolated from her peers, and faced constant judgement and criticism.</p>
   <p>But Kaitlyn's life took a turn when she was introduced to Puawānanga, Masterton's teen parenting unit. Puawānanga offers a safe and supportive environment for teen parents to raise their children and continue their education. They provide affordable housing, childcare, counseling, and educational resources to help young parents succeed and reach their goals.</p>
   <p>Kaitlyn is just one of the many young mothers that Puawānanga has helped. With their support, she was able to finish high school, access healthcare for herself and her child, and gain the confidence she needed to be a successful parent.</p>
   <h2>The Numbers Speak for Themselves</h2>
   <p>Puawānanga is making a measurable impact in the lives of teen parents in Masterton. According to their annual report, in 2019:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>82% of Puawānanga's residents were enrolled in some form of education or training</li>
    <li>95% of children living at Puawānanga received all necessary vaccinations</li>
    <li>89% of residents reported improved mental health and wellbeing since moving in</li>
    <li>100% of residents felt safe and supported at Puawānanga</li>
   </ul>
   <p>These are incredible statistics, and they are a testament to the hard work and dedication of Puawānanga's staff and supporters.</p>
   <h2>A Personal Connection</h2>
   <p>For Puawānanga staff member Rachel, working at the teen parenting unit is more than just a job. She is a former resident herself and knows firsthand the impact that Puawānanga can have on young mothers.</p>
   <p>"When I found out I was pregnant at 16, I felt like my world was ending," Rachel says. "But then I found Puawānanga and everything changed. It was a safe haven where I could be a mother, learn, grow, and become the person I am today."</p>
   <p>Rachel's story is just one of many. Puawānanga has helped countless young mothers like her find hope and empowerment in the midst of difficult circumstances.</p>
   <h2>The Importance of Support</h2>
   <p>One of the key components of Puawānanga's success is the incredible support network that they offer their residents. From staff members to fellow parents, everyone at Puawānanga is committed to helping young mothers succeed.</p>
   <p>"Having that support was life-changing for me," Kaitlyn says. "I had never felt so accepted and understood. The people at Puawānanga truly care about us and want us to succeed."</p>
   <p>It's easy to see why support is so important for young parents. Raising a child is challenging under the best circumstances, but add in the pressures and stigma of teen pregnancy, and it can feel impossible. Having a network of people who believe in you can make all the difference.</p>
