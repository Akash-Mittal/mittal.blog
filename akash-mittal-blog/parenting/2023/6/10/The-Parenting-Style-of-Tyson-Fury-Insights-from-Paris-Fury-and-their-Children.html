  <p>It was a sunny afternoon when I met Paris Fury, the wife of heavyweight boxer Tyson Fury, at their home in Morecambe. The Fury family was welcoming and hospitable, and I could feel a warm energy emanating from their household. We sat down to discuss their parenting style and what their children actually think of Tyson.</p>
  <h2>Parenting Style</h2>
  <p>Paris and Tyson have six children and are expecting their seventh child. I asked Paris about their parenting style, and she said that they are very hands-on parents. Tyson is very involved in their children's lives despite his boxing career demands. He makes it a point to spend time with them, attends their school events and activities, and plays with them regularly. The couple believes in instilling strong family values, discipline and respect. Tyson believes that anything worth having is worth working hard for, and he also believes in leading by example. Therefore, they expect their children to work hard, have manners and to never give up.</p>
  <h3>Quantifiable Examples</h3>
  <p>One of the quantifiable examples Paris shared was the award her youngest son won at school. Paries explained that he came home from school one day with a certificate which he was very proud of. Tyson, in turn, was also happy for him. However, Tyson then questioned his son about the award, asking him what he did to deserve it. When he found out that it was for helping a fellow student who had fallen in the playground, Tyson was impressed. He then used the opportunity to reinforce the need for his children to consistently do good for others, irrespective of the situation.</p>
  <h2>What Kids Actually Think of Him</h2>
  <p>I asked Paris if they thought Tyson was more fun or strict as a father figure? She replied that he can be both. The kids have dubbed him "King Fury," and they love him for the way he keeps them entertained, tells them stories, and shows interest in their lives. However, Tyson can also be a disciplinarian when it comes to enforcing rules or correcting bad behavior. Paris shared an instance where their son said Tyson was his best friend, but Paris reminded him that Tyson was not just his friend but also his father.</p>
  <p>One of the things that set Tyson apart from any other dad is his creativity in entertainment. Paris also shared that when their family goes out, Tyson likes to spend time with the children. For instance, they recently went to an arcade and enjoyed playing games with their children. She mentioned that children just love him and enjoy being around him.</p>
  <h3></h3>
  <p>Paris shared an anecdote about when Sophie, her eldest daughter, was learning to ride a bike. Tyson went out with her every day until she finally got the hang of it. Paris believes that Tyson's involvement in Sophie's journey helped build a bond between father and daughter.</p>
