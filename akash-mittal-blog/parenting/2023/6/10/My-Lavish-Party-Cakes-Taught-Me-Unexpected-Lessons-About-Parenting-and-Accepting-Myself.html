    <h2>The Story of How My Love for Lavish Party Cakes Helped Me Accept Myself as a Parent</h2>
    <p>For as long as I can remember, I've loved to bake. I find it therapeutic to focus my energy on creating something beautiful and delicious for my loved ones to enjoy. Over the years, I've become known for my lavish party cakes - towering creations with multiple tiers, intricate details, and elaborate decorations.</p>
    <p>However, as much as I loved the process of baking and decorating, I always felt guilty for spending so much time and energy on something that seemed frivolous. I'm a mom of two young kids, after all, and I should be spending my time doing more important things, right?</p>
    <p>It wasn't until I was diagnosed with ADHD that things started to make sense. Suddenly, my overabundance of energy and laser focus on the cakes had an explanation. And as I learned more about the condition and how it affects my brain, I started to realize that my love for baking was actually one of my strengths as a parent.</p>

    <h2> How My Love for Lavish Party Cakes Helped Me Grow as a Parent</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>I learned to embrace my strengths and accept my limitations - as someone with ADHD, I've always struggled with time management and organization. But when it came to baking, I found that I could hyperfocus for hours on end without getting distracted. Instead of feeling guilty for spending so much time on my cakes, I started to see it as a way to channel my energy in a positive and productive way.</li>
     <li>I connected with my kids in a new way - my love for baking has turned into a shared hobby with my kids. They love to help me mix the batter, decorate the cakes, and come up with new ideas for designs. It's given us a new way to bond and a way for me to show my kids that it's okay to indulge in our passions and hobbies, even if they seem trivial.</li>
     <li>I gained a new perspective on parenting - before my ADHD diagnosis, I often felt like a failure as a parent because I couldn't seem to keep up with the demands of running a household and caring for my kids. But as I learned more about ADHD and how it affects my brain, I started to see that my challenges were just a different way of processing information and that my strengths could be used to my advantage. By embracing my love for baking and learning to work with my strengths and limitations, I became a more confident and happy parent.</li>
