   <p>It's not easy to get back on your feet after going through a tough time. For single mom Amanda Wilhelm, getting over her husband's death and raising her two kids on her own has been an uphill battle. But when she decided to go on a trip with her children to scatter her late husband's ashes, she had no idea that she would receive so much backlash for it.</p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HNmLZpg.jpg" alt="Amanda Wilhelm">
   <h2>Ghoulish Travel or Healing Process?</h2>
   <p>Amanda and her kids took a trip to Hawaii to scatter her husband's ashes at sea, a place he loved dearly. She thought it would be a healing experience for everyone and a way to honor his memory. However, some people on social media commented that it was "ghoulish" and "inappropriate" to take the kids on such a trip.</p>
   <p>Amanda defended her decision, saying:</p>
   <blockquote>
    "I wanted my kids to feel connected to their father even though he's not with us physically anymore. I wanted them to understand that he's always with us in our hearts and memories. And I also wanted to show them that we can find ways to heal and find joy even after going through something as devastating as losing a loved one."
   </blockquote>
   <p>Amanda's case is not unique. Many families choose to scatter their loved one's ashes in meaningful places, and some even make a vacation out of it. While it may seem unusual to some people, it's important to respect each family's way of grieving and honoring their loved ones.</p>
   <h2>Quick Romance or Healthy Move?</h2>
   <p>A few months after her husband's death, Amanda met a man named Razvan online. They hit it off immediately and started dating. However, some people criticized Amanda for moving on too quickly and setting a bad example for her kids.</p>
   <p>Amanda disagrees with those comments and says:</p>
   <blockquote>
    "I'm not trying to replace my husband, and I will always love him and miss him. But I also deserve to be happy and explore new relationships. I don't think it's healthy to stay stuck in grief forever."
   </blockquote>
   <p>Research shows that there is no "right" timeline for grieving or finding love again after a significant loss. It's a personal process that varies for each individual. As long as Amanda's children are not negatively affected by her dating life, it's important for her to prioritize her own well-being and happiness.</p>
