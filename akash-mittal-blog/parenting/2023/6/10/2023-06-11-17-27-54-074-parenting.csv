"2023-06-12 06:50 PM;","It's not easy to get back on your feet after going through a tough time. For single mom Amanda Wilhelm, getting over her husband's death and raising her two kids on her own has been an uphill battle. But when she decided to go on a trip with her children to scatter her late husband's ashes, she had no idea that she would receive so much backlash for it.
Amanda and her kids took a trip to Hawaii to scatter her husband's ashes at sea, a place he loved dearly. She thought it would be a healing experience for everyone and a way to honor his memory. However, some people on social media commented that it was ""ghoulish"" and ""inappropriate"" to take the kids on such a trip.
Amanda defended her decision, saying:
Amanda's case is not unique. Many families choose to scatter their loved one's ashes in meaningful places, and some even make a vacation out of it. While it may seem unusual to some people, it's important to respect each family's way of grieving and honoring their loved ones.
A few months after her husband's death, Amanda met a man named Razvan online. They hit it off immediately and started dating. However, some people criticized Amanda for moving on too quickly and setting a bad example for her kids.

"2023-06-12 07:40 PM;","My son, who is considering participating in our community's middle school cross country team next year as a 4th grader, asked if he could run around the block. My initial thought was ""Sure, why not?"" but then I hesitated. My mind wandered to all the potential dangers that could be lurking in the streets, and I hesitated to give my son the freedom to explore beyond our front yard.
As a child of the 1970s myself, I remember spending hours outside with my friends, riding bikes, playing tag, and exploring the woods behind our house. But now as a parent, I find myself struggling to balance my desire to give my children the freedom to explore with my fear of potential dangers.
Studies have shown that there are real benefits to allowing children to engage in unstructured outdoor play. In fact, children who spend more time outside are more physically active, have better motor skills, and experience less anxiety and depression.

"2023-06-12 08:30 PM;","It was a cold winter day and I needed to put my toddler daughter in her snowsuit to head outside. As I zipped up her suit, I noticed the extra fabric around her legs and arms. Concerned about her being too warm, I decided to take her to the doctor to ensure she was properly protected from the cold. The doctor took one look at her and said that she had put on too much weight. At that moment, I realized how much our society was biased against anyone who wasn't thin.
My daughter wasn't even overweight, but the doctor had immediately assumed that her extra clothing meant she was carrying extra pounds. This incident made me realize how deeply ingrained our anti-fat bias was and how it affected our children's health. Pediatricians were no longer just assessing a child's physical health but instead were policing a child's weight, which often led to detrimental body image and unhealthy eating habits.
Childhood obesity has been on the rise for decades, and it's not just a problem in the United States. According to the World Health Organization, the prevalence of children overweight and obese increased from 4% to 6% in low-income countries and from 10% to 13% in high-income countries between 1990 and 2016. This increase is alarming because overweight and obese children are more likely to suffer from chronic diseases such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease, now and in their future adult life.
Despite this increased prevalence, the solution for childhood obesity is not as simple as just telling our children to eat less and move more. The root causes of childhood obesity are complex and typically involve community-level influences, social determinants of health, and individual biology. Addressing these factors include financial stability, food deserts, and limited access to physical activity infrastructures like parks, gyms and recreational spaces, and personal eating habits.
Sri Lankan cuisine is a great example of how food culture can make healthy eating an easy and enjoyable habit. Restaurateur Karan Gokani remembers his first time trying hoppers, made of fermented rice and coconut, and other traditional dishes. He found the cuisine flavorful and nutritious while attracting many different tastes and palates. Unlike traditional Western diet cultures of meat-eating and processed food, Sri Lankan meals are primarily plant-based and filled with whole foods. With healthful spices like turmeric, coriander, cumin, and ginger, preparing home-cooked meals to the citizens of the island is easy, delicious, and nutritious.

"2023-06-12 09:20 PM;","It's no secret that parenting is one of the toughest jobs in the world. And when you're a high-profile celebrity, the challenges are even greater. That's why it's refreshing to hear about Chris Pratt and Katherine Schwarzenegger's recent parenting milestone. They revealed that their fourth wedding anniversary vacation was also their first night away from their kids in three years.
As Pratt shared on his Instagram, ""We decided to go somewhere for our anniversary... and we haven't been on a vacation in at least four years and we haven't had a night away from our daughter in eons. So let's go! It's been a long time.""
This may seem like a small feat, but for any parent, taking a night away from their children can be a very daunting prospect. And for celebrities like Pratt and Schwarzenegger, where their every move is scrutinized, it takes an extra amount of courage to let go of their parenting responsibilities for even a short while.
According to a 2018 survey by the Pew Research Center, 57% of parents say parenting is ""exhausting"" and 46% say it's ""stressful."" Another survey by Care.com found that the average parent goes 3.2 years without taking a vacation without their children. This means that Pratt and Schwarzenegger's vacation is actually a rare and impressive feat.
In addition, studies have shown that taking a break from parenting can have significant benefits for both the parents and the children. A study published in the Journal of Marriage and Family found that parents who take vacations without their children have stronger marital relationships and experience less stress and burnout. Another study published in the Journal of Family Psychology found that children who spend time in quality daycare have better social and academic outcomes than those who do not.

"2023-06-12 11:50 PM;","When Prince Harry and Meghan Markle announced they were expecting their first child, the world eagerly awaited the news of what the royal couple would name their baby. Names like Alexander, Elizabeth, and Victoria were among the top contenders, but when Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor was finally revealed, many were surprised by the unconventional choice.
So how do Royals choose baby names? Is it based on tradition, family history, or personal preference? As it turns out, there are several factors that go into the decision-making process.
For centuries, Royals have carried on family names and traditions through their choice of baby names. The British Royal Family, in particular, has a long history of naming their children after ancestors and royals who came before them. For example, Prince Charles was named after his grandfather, King George V, while Prince William's full name is William Arthur Philip Louis, a nod to his great-grandfather King George VI and grandfather Prince Philip.
But it's not just about royalty. Royals also look to their own family history for inspiration. When the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge named their first child, Prince George, they chose a name that had special meaning to both of them. William's great-grandfather was named George VI, while Kate's father's middle name is also George.
Quantifiable example: A survey conducted by YouGov found that 18 percent of Britons believe family tradition is the most important factor in choosing a baby name, while 17 percent believed it should be a name that is ""personal and meaningful to the parents.""

"2023-06-13 12:40 AM;","Sarah was a bright and energetic 10-year-old girl, but lately she seemed to be feeling down. She was not as enthusiastic about her school work, she was not as talkative with her family and friends, and she was not enjoying her hobbies as much as she used to. Her parents noticed the change in her behavior and tried to talk to her, but Sarah only answered with short and monosyllabic words. They thought maybe she was just going through a phase, but the situation persisted. Finally, Sarah's teacher called her parents and expressed her concern about Sarah's sudden drop in academic performance. She suggested that they try to find out if something was bothering Sarah at home. That's when Sarah's parents decided to take a closer look at their parenting habits.
Perfectionistic parenting is a parenting style that puts pressure on children to meet high standards of performance and behavior. Parents who use this style believe that their children's success and happiness is directly tied to their own success and happiness as parents. They often praise their children for achievements, but criticize or ignore them for mistakes or failures. They also tend to micromanage their children's lives, making decisions for them and not allowing them to make mistakes or learn from their experiences.
Perfectionistic parenting can have detrimental effects on children's psychological and emotional well-being. Children who grow up with this kind of parenting may develop low self-esteem, anxiety, depression, or other mental health issues. They may also have difficulty establishing healthy relationships, setting realistic goals, or finding fulfillment in their lives.
When Sarah's parents realized that they had been putting too much pressure on her to excel in school and extracurricular activities, they decided to change their parenting style. They started to praise Sarah for her effort rather than her results, and they allowed her to make more decisions for herself. They also sought professional help for Sarah to cope with her anxiety and low self-esteem.
Another example is David, a 14-year-old boy who was constantly under his mother's scrutiny. She would demand to see his homework every night, check his grades online several times a day, and even monitor his whereabouts using a GPS device. David felt suffocated and resentful, but he didn't know how to confront his mother. He started to rebel by skipping school, hanging out with the wrong crowd, and experimenting with drugs. It was only after he got in trouble with the law that his mother realized that her parenting style was not only ineffective but also harmful.

"2023-06-13 12:40 AM;","Sarah was a bright and energetic 10-year-old girl, but lately she seemed to be feeling down. She was not as enthusiastic about her school work, she was not as talkative with her family and friends, and she was not enjoying her hobbies as much as she used to. Her parents noticed the change in her behavior and tried to talk to her, but Sarah only answered with short and monosyllabic words. They thought maybe she was just going through a phase, but the situation persisted. Finally, Sarah's teacher called her parents and expressed her concern about Sarah's sudden drop in academic performance. She suggested that they try to find out if something was bothering Sarah at home. That's when Sarah's parents decided to take a closer look at their parenting habits.
Perfectionistic parenting is a parenting style that puts pressure on children to meet high standards of performance and behavior. Parents who use this style believe that their children's success and happiness is directly tied to their own success and happiness as parents. They often praise their children for achievements, but criticize or ignore them for mistakes or failures. They also tend to micromanage their children's lives, making decisions for them and not allowing them to make mistakes or learn from their experiences.
Perfectionistic parenting can have detrimental effects on children's psychological and emotional well-being. Children who grow up with this kind of parenting may develop low self-esteem, anxiety, depression, or other mental health issues. They may also have difficulty establishing healthy relationships, setting realistic goals, or finding fulfillment in their lives.
When Sarah's parents realized that they had been putting too much pressure on her to excel in school and extracurricular activities, they decided to change their parenting style. They started to praise Sarah for her effort rather than her results, and they allowed her to make more decisions for herself. They also sought professional help for Sarah to cope with her anxiety and low self-esteem.
Another example is David, a 14-year-old boy who was constantly under his mother's scrutiny. She would demand to see his homework every night, check his grades online several times a day, and even monitor his whereabouts using a GPS device.

"2023-06-13 02:20 AM;","Once upon a time, Lindsay Lohan was a household name. She starred in hits like 'Mean Girls,' 'The Parent Trap,' and 'Freaky Friday.' Everyone knew her name. She was a child star who had everything going for her. But as she grew up, things started to unravel.
Lohan became tabloid fodder with her multiple rehab stints, arrests, and legal troubles. She was no longer a sought-after actress but a cautionary tale. But now, Lohan is back in the spotlight, this time with a different focus--motherhood. She recently announced that she's pregnant and is excited to start this new chapter in her life.
Lohan's rise to fame was meteoric. She was only 11-years-old when she starred in 'The Parent Trap' and won over audiences with her talent and charm. From there, the roles kept coming, and Lohan became a household name. But as she got older, things started to change.
By age 20, Lohan was already making headlines for her hard-partying ways. She was a regular fixture in the tabloids, and her career started to suffer. She had trouble showing up on set, and her behavior became increasingly erratic. In 2007, she was arrested for DUI, and her public image took a hit.
Lohan's troubles didn't end there. She had several more arrests and spent time in rehab. Her acting career stalled, and she struggled to find work. But through it all, Lohan has never lost her sense of optimism. She's always believed that she can turn things around.

"2023-06-13 03:10 AM;","As parents, we often struggle with the balance between our personal lives and our responsibilities, particularly when it comes to raising children. It's easy to feel guilty or overwhelmed when we can't be there for our children 24/7, but even the Duchess of Cambridge has admitted that she also faces these challenges.
During a recent engagement in Windsor, Kate Middleton let slip a relatable parenting confession. She joked that her children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, had a ""lovely time"" during their half-term break â€"" but she also admitted that she was ""exhausted"" by the end of it.
It's refreshing to see that even someone who has access to all the help and resources in the world can still struggle with the demands of parenthood. But what can we learn from the Duchess's confession?
One of the main takeaways from Kate Middleton's confession is that it's okay to admit when we need a break. It's easy to get caught up in the idea that we need to be constantly available and present for our children, but in reality, that's not always sustainable or healthy.
In fact, research has shown that taking breaks and prioritizing self-care can actually make us better parents in the long run. According to a study by the American Psychological Association, parents who take time for themselves report feeling less stressed and overwhelmed, and are more able to attend to their children's needs in a positive way.

Over the years, I've become known for my lavish party cakes - towering creations with multiple tiers, intricate details, and elaborate decorations.
However, as much as I loved the process of baking and decorating, I always felt guilty for spending so much time and energy on something that seemed frivolous. I'm a mom of two young kids, after all, and I should be spending my time doing more important things, right?
It wasn't until I was diagnosed with ADHD that things started to make sense. Suddenly, my overabundance of energy and laser focus on the cakes had an explanation. And as I learned more about the condition and how it affects my brain, I started to realize that my love for baking was actually one of my strengths as a parent.
Overall, my love for lavish party cakes has taught me unexpected lessons about parenting and accepting myself. It's given me a way to channel my energy and connect with my kids, and it's helped me see myself in a new light. So the next time you find yourself indulging in a hobby or passion, don't feel guilty - it could be one of your strengths as a parent.

"2023-06-13 07:20 AM;","Modern families come in many forms, and platonic co-parenting is one of the newest trends in family building. The practice involves raising children with friends, known sperm donors or through elective co-parenting connections made on so-called mating sites. This approach offers an alternate model for family building that challenges the traditional nuclear family structure and opens up new possibilities for those who wish to have children but cannot or do not want to do so through traditional means.
Advocates of platonic co-parenting argue that it provides a support system for parents and children alike, allowing for a larger sense of community and shared responsibility. It can also offer financial and logistical benefits, as well as emotional ones.
However, this alternate model is not without its challenges. Communication and legal issues can arise, and the dynamics of the relationship between co-parents can be complex to navigate. Nevertheless, platonic co-parenting is becoming increasingly popular, and it's worth exploring for those who are considering alternative methods of family building.
When Sarah and her best friend Mark decided to have a child together, they knew they were embarking on a unique journey. Sarah had always wanted to be a mother, but didn't feel ready to take on the responsibilities of parenting alone. Mark was not interested in romantic relationships, but loved the idea of being a father.
Together, they researched co-parenting sites and found a donor who shared their values and vision for raising a child. After months of planning and legal consultations, their daughter Emma was born.

"2023-06-13 08:10 AM;","Have you ever been in a situation where you find yourself showing preference among your friends' kids? It's not uncommon for parents to have a favorite child, but it becomes a bigger issue when that favoritism extends beyond their own family.
Lily and Emma were two five-year-old girls in the same kindergarten class. They were both well-behaved and friendly, but Lily's mother had a soft spot for her. She would often bring Lily gifts and treats, and would go out of her way to make sure Lily was included in activities. On the other hand, Emma was often left out and felt ignored and rejected. It didn't take long for the other parents to notice the favoritism, and tensions started to build among the group.
Research shows that parental favoritism is more common than we might think. According to a study published in the Journal of Marriage and Family, 75% of mothers and 50% of fathers have a favorite child. Another study found that favoritism can have negative impacts on the relationships between siblings, causing rivalry and resentment.
In conclusion, showing preference among friends' kids can cause unnecessary tension and resentment among parents and children alike. By being aware of our own biases and treating all kids equally, we can help create a supportive and positive environment for all the children in our lives.
When I was growing up, my mother had a tendency to show favoritism towards my younger brother. She would often give him special treatment and let him get away with things she wouldn't let me do. It caused a lot of tension between us and affected our relationship. As an adult, I've made a conscious effort to treat all the kids in my life equally and avoid making the same mistakes my mother did.

"2023-06-13 09:00 AM;","When Neha Sinha, popularly known as @thatindianchick_ on social media, posted a hilarious video on Instagram showing what parenting would look like in the year 2050, it went viral in no time. The video shows a parent controlling their child's virtual reality experience, feeding them meals in a pill form, and even choosing their future career path. While the video was meant to be satirical, there is truth in the idea that technology and science will continue to shape the way we raise our children in the future.
By 2050, we can expect artificial intelligence (AI) to play a major role in parenting. AI-powered parenting assistants will help parents monitor their child's development, behavior, and even their emotions. These systems will be capable of identifying potential concerns, such as signs of depression or autism, and recommend appropriate interventions. One such example is the smart baby monitor developed by Sproutling, which uses AI to learn a baby's sleep patterns, heart and breathing rates, and body temperature to provide personalized insights to parents.
In addition, parents can also expect AI-powered toys and gadgets that aid in their child's education and skill development. These toys will adapt to the child's learning pace and style, making it easier for parents to meet their child's unique needs. For example, the Cubetto robot from Primo Toys teaches children the basics of coding through play, using a screenless programming language of colourful blocks.
The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us the potential of remote learning and online education. In the future, home schooling is expected to become more mainstream, with more parents opting for personalized education for their children. Online platforms like Khan Academy and Coursera will become increasingly popular in providing a comprehensive education for students of all ages and abilities.
There will also be a rise in the popularity of homeschooling communities, where families come together to share resources, ideas, and to socialize. Such communities will eventually lead to the creation of virtual schools, where students from all over the world can learn together, without the constraints of geographical boundaries.

"2023-06-13 09:50 AM;","It was the middle of summer, and Karen, a single mother of two young children, was faced with a dilemma. She had recently received a job offer in a different state, but her ex-husband had custody of the children and refused to let her take them with her. She was torn between pursuing her dream job and being there for her kids. The thought of leaving them behind was unbearable, but she also knew that turning down the offer could mean financial instability and a lack of career growth.

Karen's situation is not uncommon. According to a recent survey, approximately one-third of parents who share custody of their children live more than 100 miles from each other. Long-distance co-parenting can be challenging, but with the right mindset and tools, it is possible to make it work.

"2023-06-13 12:20 PM;","It's no secret that divorce can be tough, especially when children are involved. But, as Jennifer Lopez and Jennifer Garner have shown us, it is possible to co-parent in a healthy and positive way, putting the kids at the center of everything.
Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony might not have made it as a couple, but they certainly came together to raise their two children, Emme and Max. According to Lopez, they worked hard to maintain a positive relationship for the sake of their kids. When she started dating Alex Rodriguez, she made sure he had a great relationship with her kids too.
Similarly, Jennifer Garner has made co-parenting with ex-husband Ben Affleck a priority. She recently opened up about their successful relationship, stating that their focus is always on their children's happiness and well-being. They want to demonstrate a strong and loving family dynamic, even though they aren't together romantically.
Co-parenting can be difficult, but when done well, it can have a positive impact on all parties involved - including the children. Studies have shown that children from families with healthy co-parenting relationships have better emotional, behavioral, and academic outcomes. They feel more secure and are better able to build healthy relationships throughout their own lives.
But what does healthy co-parenting look like in practice?

"2023-06-13 02:00 PM;","It was a sunny afternoon when I met Paris Fury, the wife of heavyweight boxer Tyson Fury, at their home in Morecambe. The Fury family was welcoming and hospitable, and I could feel a warm energy emanating from their household. We sat down to discuss their parenting style and what their children actually think of Tyson.
Paris and Tyson have six children and are expecting their seventh child. I asked Paris about their parenting style, and she said that they are very hands-on parents. Tyson is very involved in their children's lives despite his boxing career demands. He makes it a point to spend time with them, attends their school events and activities, and plays with them regularly. The couple believes in instilling strong family values, discipline and respect. Tyson believes that anything worth having is worth working hard for, and he also believes in leading by example. Therefore, they expect their children to work hard, have manners and to never give up.
One of the quantifiable examples Paris shared was the award her youngest son won at school. Paries explained that he came home from school one day with a certificate which he was very proud of. Tyson, in turn, was also happy for him. However, Tyson then questioned his son about the award, asking him what he did to deserve it. When he found out that it was for helping a fellow student who had fallen in the playground, Tyson was impressed. He then used the opportunity to reinforce the need for his children to consistently do good for others, irrespective of the situation.
I asked Paris if they thought Tyson was more fun or strict as a father figure? She replied that he can be both. The kids have dubbed him ""King Fury,"" and they love him for the way he keeps them entertained, tells them stories, and shows interest in their lives. However, Tyson can also be a disciplinarian when it comes to enforcing rules or correcting bad behavior. Paris shared an instance where their son said Tyson was his best friend, but Paris reminded him that Tyson was not just his friend but also his father.
One of the things that set Tyson apart from any other dad is his creativity in entertainment. Paris also shared that when their family goes out, Tyson likes to spend time with the children. For instance, they recently went to an arcade and enjoyed playing games with their children. She mentioned that children just love him and enjoy being around him.

"2023-06-13 03:40 PM;","Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, is known for her hands-on parenting approach. In the lead up to King Charles's coronation, a body language expert noticed that Kate used a subtle strategy to keep her children well-behaved during the ceremony.
According to body language expert Judi James, Kate used subtle gestures and cues to keep her youngest son, Prince Louis, from acting out. She used this strategy to ensure that the children behaved well during the ceremony and avoided tantrums.
James observed that Kate often asked her children to hold her hand or whispered in their ears, reminding them to behave. For Prince Louis, James noticed that Kate subtly nudged him whenever he started to get too playful.
In an interview with Express.co.uk, James explained that the Duchess of Cambridge used a technique known as 'nudging' to adjust her child's behaviour. She said, ""We know it's really hard to tell a toddler to stop doing something. So what she was doing was nudging him into slightly less playful activity...that's the kind of thing that parents do without even realizing it.""
Kate's subtle technique is a form of positive reinforcement, which is a powerful tool in parenting. Instead of scolding her son for misbehaving, Kate provided gentle physical cues that directed him towards more desirable behaviour.

"2023-06-13 05:20 PM;","As a child growing up in an upper-middle-class household, Sarah struggled with feelings of emptiness and inadequacy as she watched her mother yo-yoing between different diets and exercise regimes to lose weight. Even though Sarah was a healthy weight, her mother's preoccupation with thinness and the constant stream of messages from media and peers about the importance of a narrow beauty ideal left her feeling insecure and anxious about her body image.
Unfortunately, Sarah's experience is not unique. Studies have consistently shown that children who are exposed to messages promoting thinness and negative attitudes toward fatness are more likely to develop disordered eating behaviors, low self-esteem, and poor body image, regardless of their own weight status. Furthermore, the emphasis on individual responsibility and moral judgment when it comes to health and weight gain ignores the complex societal and environmental factors that contribute to these issues, from poverty and access to healthy food options to discrimination and social exclusion.
As parents, it's important to be aware of the ways in which both explicit and implicit anti-fat bias can influence our attitudes and behaviors around food, exercise, and self-care, and how this can affect our children's perception of themselves and their bodies. Opting out of the diet culture altogether is not always feasible, but there are steps we can take to cultivate a positive relationship with food and our bodies that doesn't rely on shame, guilt, or deprivation.
Karan Gokani, a restaurateur and food enthusiast, has always been fascinated by the richness and diversity of world cuisine, and how food can be a way of connecting with different cultures and traditions. Recently, he discovered Sri Lankan cuisine and fell in love with its bold flavors, fragrant spices, and unique dishes like hoppers, a type of pancake made of fermented rice batter and coconut milk that's crispy on the edges and fluffy in the middle.
For Karan, the experience of discovering new flavors and ingredients is not just a matter of personal enjoyment, but also a way of expanding his worldview and supporting local communities and small-scale producers. By sourcing ingredients from local farms and markets, he can ensure that the food he serves is fresh, sustainable, and free from harmful chemicals and practices.

"2023-06-13 06:10 PM;","It's no secret that teenagers today spend a lot of time on their smartphones, and often use them to explore their own sexuality. While it is natural for young people to be curious about sex, it can be a shock to parents who accidentally discover sexual content on their child's phone. So, what should you do if you find out your teenager is exploring their sexuality through their phone?
It is not uncommon for parents to accidentally discover sexual content on their child's phone. This could be anything from explicit messages or photos to website histories. While it can be distressing for parents to stumble across these things, it is important not to overreact. Remember, your child is not doing anything abnormal or unnatural.
Instead of immediately punishing your child, use this as an opportunity to have an open and honest conversation. Explain that you found what you did and ask if they would like to talk about it. Be calm and non-judgmental in your approach. Remember that your child is likely feeling embarrassed and defensive, so try to keep the conversation light and avoid accusations or blame.
One reason your teenager may be using their phone to explore their sexuality is loneliness or a lack of intimacy in their life. As a parent, it is important to ask yourself if you are meeting your child's emotional needs. Are you spending quality time with them? Do they feel supported and loved? If the answer is no, then it may be time to start making changes.
Talk to your child about their feelings and try to find ways to increase their social support. Encourage them to get involved in extracurricular activities or join clubs. You may also want to consider family counseling if you feel like your child's behavior is driven by deeper emotional issues.

"2023-06-13 07:00 PM;","Parenting a child with Friedreich's ataxia (FA) can be a major challenge. There are countless doctor appointments, therapy sessions and complex medical decisions to make. It can be overwhelming and often lonely. But the hardest part of parenting a child with FA may be managing the emotions that come with the job, especially the negative self-talk.
I know what that's like because I was there. When my child was first diagnosed with FA, I struggled with feelings of guilt, shame and despair. I questioned my parenting skills and wondered if I was doing enough for my child. This led me down a path of negative self-talk that was not only unhealthy, but detrimental to my child's well-being.
Through my own journey of healing and personal development, I discovered the power of positive self-talk. I began to use daily affirmations, mantras and reflections that helped me to change the way I thought and spoke to myself. And as a result, my relationship with my child improved, and I was able to build a deeper connection based on love, care and understanding.
Self-talk is the way we communicate with ourselves. It's the internal dialogue we engage in as we process thoughts and emotions. Self-talk can be both positive and negative, and it has a profound impact on our mental and emotional well-being. For parents of children with FA, self-talk is especially important because it can shape the way we view ourselves and our role as caregivers.
When we engage in negative self-talk, we are essentially telling ourselves that we are not good enough, that we are not doing enough, or that we don't matter. This type of self-talk leads to feelings of shame, guilt, and inadequacy, which can be toxic to our relationships with our children.
