    <p>My son, who is considering participating in our community's middle school cross country team next year as a 4th grader, asked if he could run around the block. My initial thought was "Sure, why not?" but then I hesitated. My mind wandered to all the potential dangers that could be lurking in the streets, and I hesitated to give my son the freedom to explore beyond our front yard.</p>

     <li>The amount of time children spend playing outside has decreased by 50% in the past 4 decades.</li>
     <li>Cases of childhood obesity have tripled since the 1970s.</li>

    <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
    <p>As a child of the 1970s myself, I remember spending hours outside with my friends, riding bikes, playing tag, and exploring the woods behind our house. But now as a parent, I find myself struggling to balance my desire to give my children the freedom to explore with my fear of potential dangers.</p>
    <p>Studies have shown that there are real benefits to allowing children to engage in unstructured outdoor play. In fact, children who spend more time outside are more physically active, have better motor skills, and experience less anxiety and depression.</p>
