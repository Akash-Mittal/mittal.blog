  <p>Samantha and Michael had been friends since college. After years of watching their separate failed relationships, they each desired to experience parenthood. Fortunately, their shared dream of raising a child led them to choose co-parenting as a viable option. Without any romantic attachment, they came to an agreement on how to co-parent, split household expenses and time with the child. Today, they are happily raising their daughter lovingly and in complete harmony.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Samantha and Michael are not alone. Many couples find themselves considering or opting for platonic co-parenting as a means for raising children. Platonic co-parenting is an arrangement that involves two or more adults agreeing to raise a child or children without being romantically involved. Instead, the adults sign a contract or agreement stipulating the terms of their shared parental responsibilities.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>According to a 2018 Family Equality Council report, the number of LGBTQ couples who have co-parented outside of a romantic relationship has doubled over the last decade. Moreover, many heterosexual couples, mostly women, opt for platonic relationships for a variety of reasons. For example, some women desire a child but do not want to be in a romantic relationship, while others may not have found the right partner.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>With the rise of social media and dating and mating sites like Modamily and Coparents.com, more and more people are finding matches to co-parent with. These platforms allow prospective co-parents to list their preferred parenting styles, educational values, childcare desires, and much more. The goal is to form a cohesive partnership that supports the children's healthy upbringing while making co-parenting work.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Platonic co-parenting, like any other family building option, has its advantages and disadvantages. Nonetheless, several quantifiable benefits make it worth considering.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Firstly, platonic co-parenting does away with the pressure to find the perfect romantic partner for co-parenting. This approach fosters a cooperative and supportive relationship between co-parents and an unbiased focus on what is best for the children.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Secondly, co-parenting expands children's socialization, as they experience more than one family structure. Research has shown that children with different family structures tend to communicate and express themselves better ultimately leading to better social and psychological adjustment.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Thirdly and most crucially, platonic co-parenting enables children to enjoy all the benefits of having two present and committed parents without the emotional baggage that often accompanies romantic relationships. Without the tensions and conflicts common in romantic relationships, the bond between the co-parents remains healthy and stable, fostering emotionally stable children.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>That being said, co-parenting has its possible downsides. Firstly, the original terms and agreements may need to be revisited if one parent gets in a relationship. The non-romantic co-parent might not welcome the new partner getting involved in parenting. Secondly, there might be some difficulty in explaining the complexity of the family structure to the child, especially if each co-parent starts a new relationship. Finally, any disagreements between platonic co-parents may put the child in a difficult position.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, platonic co-parenting is increasingly becoming a popular option for family building in contemporary society. It offers a creative way to enjoy the benefits of parenting without the traditional romantic stresses. It's a proactive way of facing modern family building challenges like the rising cost of medical treatment, lack of proper parenting partners, and much more. With the proper co-parenting agreement, it is an arrangement that can work excellently.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Personal anecdote: When Karen and Tom, close friends, decided to become co-parents, people were skeptical and often made unsupportive comments, even some family members. Nonetheless, it has been almost four years, and they have been able to raise their daughter gracefully. Even with new relationships in their lives, they prioritize their child, showing that co-parenting works.</p>
