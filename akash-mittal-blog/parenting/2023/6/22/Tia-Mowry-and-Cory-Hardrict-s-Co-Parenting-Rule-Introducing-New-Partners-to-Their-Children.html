   <p>Divorce or separation can be tough on everyone, especially on the children. However, some ex-couples manage to keep it civil and maintain a healthy co-parenting relationship. Such is the case of Tia Mowry and Cory Hardrict.</p>
   <p>Tia Mowry, actress and host of the Food Network show 'Tia Mowry at Home', and Cory Hardrict, actor and producer, got married in 2008 and have two children together, a son named Cree Taylor born in 2011 and a daughter named Cairo Tiahna born in 2018. However, like many Hollywood couples, their marriage came to an end, and they got divorced in 2021.</p>
   <p>Despite their separation, Tia and Cory have managed to co-parent their children amicably and have set some rules to ensure a smooth transition when introducing new partners to their family. One of their co-parenting rules is to wait at least six months of dating before introducing a new partner to their children.</p>
   <p>"The reason why we followed that rule is because when Cree and Cairo are introduced to these different people, it can hurt. It's not so much about us anymore, it's about them," Tia said in an interview with Today.</p>
   <p>The six-month rule is just one example of how Tia and Cory have put their children's best interests first. They prioritize open communication and make sure that their children's emotional well-being is always a top priority.</p>
   <p>According to a study published by the American Psychological Association, co-parenting and parental conflict have a significant impact on children's mental health and development. Children who are exposed to high levels of conflict between their parents are more likely to experience emotional and behavioral problems such as anxiety, depression, and aggression.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, children who are raised in a supportive and loving environment, even after a divorce or separation, are more likely to thrive emotionally, socially, and academically.</p>
   <p>Here are some practical tips on how to co-parent effectively and introduce new partners to your children:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Put your Children's needs first: Always prioritize your children's needs and well-being over your own. Be sensitive to their emotions and make sure they feel heard and validated.</li>
    <li>Communicate openly and honestly: Be open and honest with your co-parent about your plans to introduce a new partner to your children. Discuss how you can both support your children throughout the transition.</li>
    <li>Take it slow: Take your time before introducing your new partner to your children. Wait until you are both serious about the relationship and have taken the time to build a strong foundation of trust and respect.</li>
    <li>Be respectful: Be respectful of your co-parent's feelings and opinions. Avoid speaking negatively about your co-parent in front of your children, and encourage open and honest communication.</li>
    <li>Get professional support: Don't be afraid to seek professional support for yourself or your children during the transition. Counseling or therapy can help your family navigate the emotional challenges of divorce, separation, and co-parenting.</li>
