    <h2>The inspiration story of child neuroscience and parenting in Costa Rica</h2>
    <p>In Costa Rica, we are always looking for ways to improve the health and well-being of our families. That's why we are excited to announce that in July, we will become the regional epicenter of child neuroscience and parenting!</p>
    <p>The inspiration behind this initiative comes from the experience of a young mother, Maria, who noticed that her child was struggling with speech delays. After several consultations with experts in the field, she learned that the delay was caused by a problem in the child's brain development. Determined to help her child, Maria began a journey to learn more about child neuroscience and discovered that this knowledge was scarce in her region.</p>
    <p>Determined to create a lasting impact on the lives of families in her community, Maria decided to pool her resources to create a center that would focus on child neuroscience and parenting. Her goal was to create a space where parents and professionals could learn more about the brain development of children and how to support them.</p>
    <p>Thanks to Maria's vision, the center has been successful in helping many families overcome some of the challenges that come with raising children. Her model has now become a nationwide framework that helps families across the country.</p>
