    <h2>The Cringe-Worthy Story</h2>
    <p>During one of his weekly visits to his children, Peter Andre was caught off-guard when his daughter asked him about one of his past behaviour that he was not particularly proud of. He realized that being a parent means having to answer difficult questions and explain past mistakes to his children. This led him to reflect on his role as a parent and how his actions in the past can affect his children's perception of him today.</p>
