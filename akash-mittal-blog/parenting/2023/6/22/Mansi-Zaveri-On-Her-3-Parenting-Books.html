   <h2>The Story Behind the Books</h2>
   <p>As a mother of two, Mansi Zaveri struggled with the complex and often overwhelming task of parenting. She scoured books and online resources, looking for practical tips and advice, but found that many of them were confusing and contradictory. Eventually, she decided to take matters into her own hands and began writing down her experiences and insights into parenting.</p>
   <p>These writings eventually became the basis for her three parenting books, which have gained a large following among parents and educators around the world.</p>
