    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>When my daughter started first grade, she came home from school every day sad and lonely. It broke my heart to see her struggle to make friends and fit in with her classmates. As a parent, it's tough to know what to do in these situations.</p>
    <p>But with some research and trial and error, I discovered some effective ways to encourage her to make friends and feel more comfortable at school.</p>
   </section>
   <section id="examples">
    
    <p>Research has shown that children who have friends at school:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Are more engaged in academic and extracurricular activities</li>
     <li>Have higher self-esteem and lower levels of anxiety and depression</li>
     <li>Are more likely to succeed in their careers and personal relationships as adults</li>
    </ul>
    <p>On the other hand, kids who struggle to make friends may experience:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Academic difficulties</li>
     <li>Behavioral problems</li>
     <li>Low self-esteem and confidence</li>
     <li>Difficulty forming positive relationships later in life</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
    <p>As parents, there are several things we can do to help our children make friends at school:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Encourage social activities: Ask your child what extracurricular activities they are interested in and sign them up for social activities outside of school. It can be a sports team, a music class, or a community volunteer group. These activities will expose your child to other kids who share similar interests and make it easier for them to strike up a conversation.</li>
     <li>Teach social skills: Many kids struggle with socializing because they haven't learned the appropriate social skills. Teach your child how to start a conversation, listen actively, and show kindness and empathy towards others.</li>
     <li>Build confidence: Children who lack confidence are more likely to struggle with making friends. Encourage your child to try new things, praise them for their efforts, and provide opportunities for them to practice their social skills in a safe and supportive environment.</li>
     <li>Model positive social behavior: Children learn by example, so make sure you model positive social behavior in your interactions with others. Show your child how to be a good listener, how to share with others, and how to resolve conflicts in a respectful way.</li>
    </ol>
