  <p>Parenting can be both exciting and challenging, and every parent wants to provide the best possible care for their child. That's why Kelly Clarkson's recent appearance on Glennon Doyle's podcast "We Can Do Hard Things" has caught the attention of many parents around the world. In the podcast, Kelly shared her insights into motherhood, touching on some of the key aspects that parents can relate to, including discipline, prioritization, and self-care.</p><img src="https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2021-04/1280_kelly_clarkson_the_voice_210414_tco.jpg?h=9d1d385f&amp;itok=M38PWPhV">
  <h2>Discipline</h2>
  <p>Discipline is an important aspect of parenting, and Kelly emphasized the importance of positive reinforcement in shaping her children's behavior. She believes that praising her kids when they do something good rather than just reprimanding them when they do something wrong can go a long way in building their confidence and making them feel loved. Kelly shared an example of how she rewards her children with a dollar every day they make their bed, encouraging them to develop good habits early on.</p>
  <h2>Prioritization</h2>
  <p>As a working mother, Kelly knows the importance of prioritizing her time with her children. She shared that she sets boundaries in her work schedule to ensure she has enough quality time with her kids, and that she doesn't work on weekends unless it's absolutely necessary. Kelly believes that the key to balancing work and family is knowing when to say no, and that it's okay to prioritize family over work sometimes.</p>
  <h2>Self-Care</h2>
  <p>Kelly also stressed the importance of self-care for parents, especially mothers. She shared how she sets aside time for herself every day to do something that makes her happy, whether it's reading a book or going for a run. Kelly believes that taking care of oneself is not selfish, but rather essential to being the best parent one can be. She encouraged other parents to prioritize their own self-care, even if it means asking for help from family or hiring a babysitter.</p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>In summary, Kelly Clarkson's insights into parenting on Glennon Doyle's podcast serve as a helpful reminder for all parents that parenting can be challenging, but with the right mindset and tools, it can also be rewarding. Disciplining positively, prioritizing family time, and practicing self-care are all essential aspects of being the best parent possible.
