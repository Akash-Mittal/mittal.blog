    <p>It's the year 2050. The world is a different place than it was thirty years before. Technology has advanced at a rapid pace, and parenting along with it. The norm of parenting is not restricted to feeding, clothing, and educating children but is a lot more than that.</p>
    <p>The idea of parenting in 2050 may sound drastic, but it is a reality that is currently being worked on by scientists, engineers, and policymakers. There's no denying that it's an exciting time to be alive.</p>
    <p>Take a walk with me, and let's explore the future of parenting.</p>
    <h2>Robots - The Ultimate Nanny</h2>
    <p>In the future, nannies will no longer be human. Instead, robotic nannies, or "robannies" for short, will take their place. These robots will be equipped with artificial intelligence, meaning they will be able to learn from their experiences and develop their own personalities. They'll also be able to accurately detect if a child is upset and in need of attention.</p>
    <p>The child can talk to the robot and hear it's soothing voice. The robannies will be super intelligent, organized, and punctual. Household activities will be sorted with perfection, and no more babies will be left with dirty diapers or forgotten feeding times. With so much intelligence and mindfulness of routine, parents may feel redundant in comparison with their robannies.</p>
    <h2>Molecular-Level Genome Editing</h2>
    <p>The future of genetics is already here and available in the form of CRISPR gene editing. It allows a human to select the desirable characteristics of their child even before their birth. Parents will be able to choose their baby's eye color, height, and IQ level, amongst other things.</p>
    <p>While some may see this as controversial and unethical, others will embrace it as a revolutionary way to improve the human race. It will become more common and sophisticated with the advancement of technology.</p>
    <h2>Virtual Reality Babysitters</h2>
    <p>Virtual Reality-based video games are already popular in 2021, and their growth rate is consistent. When a child is in need of attention, parents will send their child off to a virtual reality babysitter. Children will find the virtual world a stimulating and enriching experience full of discoveries. The parents could then, complete their urgent tasks peacefully without being troubled.</p>
    <p>However, one should also remember that the real world has much more to offer than the virtual world. The child-parent bond should never be compromised, or rather, left for a machine to fill.</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>"The advancement of technology has made parenting easier, but as a parent, you should always prioritize your child's emotional and mental development."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>The future of parenting is bright and exciting, but we must remember to keep sight of what truly matters.</li>
     <li>The invention of robannies and Virtual Reality Innovations and gene editing are captivating. However, they must not come at the cost of having a meaningful relationship with one's child.</li>
     <li>Lastly, technology's main objective should always be to support the parenting process, and not to replace the parent.</li>
