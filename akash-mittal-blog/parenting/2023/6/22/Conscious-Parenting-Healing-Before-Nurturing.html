     <p>As a new parent, I was excited to embark on the journey of raising and nurturing my child. But what I didn't realize at the time was that I first needed to heal before I could effectively nurture.</p>
     <p>Growing up, I had experienced a lot of trauma and unresolved emotions. These issues had carried over into my adult life and were affecting my ability to be a present and conscious parent.</p>
     <p>It wasn't until I began to address my own emotional wounds and seek healing that I was able to become the parent I had always wanted to be. I realized that by taking care of myself first, I was able to better care for my child and create a healthier family dynamic.</p>
