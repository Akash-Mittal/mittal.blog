   <p>As soon as Jennifer Lawrence married Cooke Maroney, she knew he was going to be a great father. But it wasn't until they welcomed their first child into the world that she truly realized how incredible he was.</p>
   <p>From the moment their little one was born, Cooke was hands-on and attentive. He took on diaper duty without hesitation, stayed up all night soothing their baby to sleep, and always put their child's needs before his own. Whenever Jennifer was feeling overwhelmed, Cooke was right there to pick up the slack and offer her support.</p>
   <p>But it wasn't just his willingness to help out that made Cooke such a great father. It was his ability to connect with their child on a deep and meaningful level. He knew exactly how to make them laugh, how to calm their fears, and how to comfort them when they were upset. No matter what life threw their way, Cooke was able to keep their family grounded and strong.</p>
