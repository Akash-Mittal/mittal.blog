    <p>When Maryanne dropped her son off at college, she felt like her heart was being torn apart. She watched as he walked away and tried to hold back her tears. Over the next few days, she found herself calling him constantly, reminding him to eat well and study hard. She couldn't help feeling like she needed to protect him from the world and make sure he was okay. But was she hovering in helicopter mode?</p>
    <p>This is a common experience for many parents who find it hard to let go of their children's hands even when they are grown up. But the truth is, college students need to develop their own independence and learn how to take care of themselves.</p>
    <h2>The Numbers Speak Volumes</h2>
    <p>A recent survey conducted by the University of North Carolina at Greensboro found that 91% of college students said their parents were involved in their lives to some degree. Out of those, 8% said their parents were "extremely over-involved" and 20% said their parents were "somewhat over-involved."</p>
    <p>This means that a large proportion of college parents may be hovering in helicopter mode, albeit unknowingly.</p>
    <h2>The Problem with Hovering</h2>
    <p>When parents hover in helicopter mode, it can rob their children of the chance to learn valuable life skills such as decision-making, problem-solving, and independence. Students who have over-involved parents can also struggle with anxiety and self-doubt, as they may feel like they are constantly being watched and judged by their parents.</p>
    <p>As college students transition into adulthood, they need to learn how to make their own decisions, accept their own consequences, and gain confidence in their abilities. If parents are always there to swoop in and solve their problems, students may miss out on these crucial experiences.</p>
