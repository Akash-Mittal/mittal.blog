   <p>When Peter Andre gave a parenting lesson to his kids, he probably didn't expect they would throw his past behaviour back at him.</p>
   <p>In a video posted on his Instagram, Peter was heard telling his two elder children, Princess and Junior: "If you ever speak rudely to anyone or upset anyone, or use your manners wrongly, I promise you that GPS system I bought for the car..." But before Peter could finish his sentence, Junior interrupted him and asked, "Oh, was that for us when we called the police on you and Emily?" referring to an incident that happened four years ago when Junior and Princess had called 999 amid fears from seeing Peter arguing with his then-wife Emily.</p>
   <p>Peter was visibly taken aback by his son's words and tried to defend himself, but the kids weren't done yet. Princess chimed in, "And what about when you spit on the floor in the kitchen?" referring to another incident from 2016 when Peter was captured on film spitting on his kitchen floor. Peter laughed nervously and attempted to make a joke out of the situation, but the damage was already done.</p>
   <p>This incident highlights the importance of leading by example as a parent. Peter was trying to teach his kids something important, but his past behaviour contradicted his words and made him look hypocritical.</p>
   
   <p>If we look beyond Peter Andre's situation, there are ample examples of how parents' behaviour can impact their children in quantifiable ways. For instance:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Research shows that children who witness domestic violence are more likely to become perpetrators or victims of violence themselves (source: <a href="https://www.nspcc.org.uk/preventing-abuse/child-abuse-and-neglect/domestic-abuse/effects-of-domestic-abuse-on-children-and-young-people/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NSPCC</a>).</li>
    <li>A study found that children whose parents had unhealthy eating habits were more likely to develop obesity and other health issues (source: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29747829/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PubMed</a>).</li>
    <li>Children who grow up with parents who abuse drugs or alcohol have a higher risk of developing addiction themselves (source: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4553654/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NCBI</a>).</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Leading by Example</h2>
   <p>So, what can parents do to ensure they are leading by example? Here are some practical tips:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Be aware of your own behaviour and how it may impact your children.</li>
    <li>Model the behaviour you want to see in your children. For instance, if you want them to be polite, use manners yourself.</li>
    <li>Apologize when you make mistakes and show your children how to take responsibility for your actions.</li>
    <li>Communicate with your children about your values and why they are important.</li>
    <li>Get professional help if you have recurring issues that are impacting your behaviour as a parent.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Parents' behaviour can have a significant impact on their children's lives.</li>
    <li>Leading by example and modelling the behaviour you want to see in your children is crucial.</li>
    <li>Communicating with your children about your values and seeking professional help when needed are also important steps towards being a good role model as a parent.</li>
   </ol>
