   <p>Co-parenting can be a challenging task. When separated or divorced parents work together to raise their children, conflicts may arise that can negatively impact the kids' emotional well-being. However, with the right approach, co-parenting can be a rewarding experience for everyone involved. In a recent interview with SheKnows, Jennifer Garner and Sheryl Lee Ralph shared their thoughts on healthy co-parenting and how it can benefit children.</p>
   <h2>An interesting story</h2>
   <p>Garner, who co-parents her three children with ex-husband Ben Affleck, shared an interesting anecdote about how they managed to keep the lines of communication open despite their divorce. "We've made a commitment to each other to put our kids first and to be respectful and kind to each other," she said.</p>
   <p>According to Garner, this approach paid off when they were both cast in the movie "Justice League" and had to spend a lot of time on set together. "I think we were able to tuck any resentment or personal emotions aside and put our kids first," she said.</p>
   <h2>Quantifiable examples</h2>
   <p>Ralph, who divorced her husband after 25 years of marriage, also emphasized the importance of putting the children's needs first. "We didn't have to have a bad divorce because there was so much love that had built up over the years," she said. "We both understood that it was important to make sure our child continued to thrive."</p>
   <p>Ralph also shared some practical tips for healthy co-parenting. "First and foremost, be present," she said. "Don't just be there physically - be there emotionally and mentally. Listen to your child." She also advised parents to keep their child's schedule in mind when making co-parenting arrangements and to communicate clearly and kindly with their ex-partner.</p>
   <h2>Captivating title</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, healthy co-parenting is possible even after a divorce or separation. By putting the children first, being respectful and kind to each other, and communicating effectively, parents can create a loving and stable environment for their kids to thrive in.
