   <p>Co-parenting can be a challenging experience, but it can also be very rewarding to see children thrive and grow in a supportive environment. Two celebrities who have shared their insights on healthy co-parenting are Jennifer Garner and Sheryl Lee Ralph. Let's see what they have to say!</p>
   <h2>Anecdotes from Jennifer Garner</h2>
   <p>Jennifer Garner, who shares custody of her three children with her ex-husband Ben Affleck, has spoken publicly about the importance of communication, respect, and flexibility in co-parenting. In an interview with People, she shared:</p>
   <blockquote>
    "When we can be together, we work really hard at making that happen. We say, 'This is mommy and daddy time', and they kind of understand that.
   </blockquote>
   <p>Garner has also emphasized the importance of putting the children first and avoiding negative talk about the other parent. In a Today show interview, she said:</p>
   <blockquote>
    "It has to be the kids first. And everybody's gotta be able to get over themselves and be like, 'I don't care what he said, she said, I don't care what he did, she did, just kid, kid, kid, focus, focus, focus.'"
   </blockquote>
   <p>In addition, Garner revealed that she and Affleck attend therapy together to work through their co-parenting issues. This shows that seeking professional help can be a valuable tool in building a healthy co-parenting relationship.</p>
   <h2>Examples from Sheryl Lee Ralph</h2>
   <p>Sheryl Lee Ralph, an actress best known for her role in the TV show "Moesha", has also spoken about her experience with co-parenting. She and her ex-husband Eric Maurice have a son together and have successfully co-parented for over two decades. In an interview with MadameNoire, she shared:</p>
   <blockquote>
    "At the beginning, we could barely stand to be in the same room with each other. But we had to work it out. We had to work together for this little person that we put on the planet."
   </blockquote>
   <p>Ralph and Maurice have worked out a system where they split custody evenly and communicate regularly about important decisions regarding their son's education and health. They also make an effort to attend family events and holidays together, so their son can feel the love and support of both parents.</p>
   <p>Ralph has emphasized the importance of forgiveness and letting go of past hurts in order to move forward in a co-parenting relationship. She also advises parents to communicate openly and honestly, even when it may be difficult. By doing so, parents can build trust and respect with each other, which can lead to a healthier co-parenting dynamic.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion: 3 Key Points</h2>
