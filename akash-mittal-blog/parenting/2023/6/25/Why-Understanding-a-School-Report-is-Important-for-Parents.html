  <p>Parents need to understand their child's report card for many reasons. Here are a few examples:</p>
  <ul>

   <li><strong>Setting Goals:</strong> Understanding the report card will help parents set realistic and achievable goals for their children by taking into account their academic strengths and weaknesses.</li>

  </ul>

   <li><strong>Understand the Grading System:</strong> Different schools may use different grading systems. Parents should ask the school about their grading system or inquire with their child's teacher if they're unsure.</li>
   <li><strong>Identify Strengths and Weaknesses:</strong> Understand your child's strengths and weaknesses in a subject and why this is the case. Ask the teacher what specific skills your child needs to improve to excel in that subject area.</li>
   <li><strong>Not Just Academics:</strong> School reports do not provide information on only academics but also the child's attitude, behavior and participation in class. These factors play a big role in shaping a child's personality and success in future.</li>
  </ul>
