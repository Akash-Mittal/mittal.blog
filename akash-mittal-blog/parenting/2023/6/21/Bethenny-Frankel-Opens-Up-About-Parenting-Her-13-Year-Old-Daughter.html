    <p>"Being a single mother is a job in itself. I had to make sure Bryn had everything she needed while also keeping up with my work, which often required travel," she says.</p>
    <p>Despite the challenges, Bethenny's love for her daughter gave her the strength to keep going no matter what. As she navigated the ups and downs of being a single mother, she learned valuable lessons about what it takes to be a good parent.</p>

     <li>Practice Patience - "Kids can be challenging at times, but it's important to remember that they are still learning and growing. Practice patience and be patient with your child as they work through their own struggles," she says.</li>
