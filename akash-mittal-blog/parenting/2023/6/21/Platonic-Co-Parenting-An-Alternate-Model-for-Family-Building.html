    <h2>Story: Two Best Friends Raising a Child Together</h2>
    <p>Amy and Sarah have been best friends since childhood. They have always talked about starting a family together, but neither of them wanted a romantic relationship. So, they decided to become platonic co-parents.</p>
    <p>They found a sperm donor and went through the process of getting pregnant together. When their son was born, they both took on equal responsibilities for raising him. They split the cost of childcare and shared the duties of feeding, bathing, and playing with their child.</p>
    <p>Amy and Sarah's platonic co-parenting arrangement has been successful so far. They have a strong bond as friends and co-parents, and their son has two loving and involved parents in his life.</p>
