  <article>
   <p>Rachel, a 32-year-old mother living in the Twin Cities area of Minnesota, never thought she would be a single parent. She had always imagined a happy family with a loving husband and children. Unfortunately, after a few years of marriage, things didn't go as planned. Her husband decided to leave the family, leaving Rachel to take care of their two young children on her own.</p>
   <p>Rachel's story is not unique. In fact, there are over 12 million single-parent families in the United States. These families face unique challenges that those in two-parent households don't experience. From financial difficulties to emotional strain, single parents must navigate their life circumstances in a way that two-parent families do not.</p>
   <h3> Single Parenting Struggles</h3>
   <p>As a single parent, Rachel has had to face numerous challenges while raising her children alone. Some of the biggest struggles include:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Financial strain: Single parents often face financial difficulties since they are the sole provider for their family, which makes them more prone to poverty and lack of basic needs.</li>
    <li>Emotional stress: Being the only parent and caregiver can lead to emotional exhaustion.</li>
    <li>Transportation issues: Trying to get children to events and appointments on time with no extra hands can be challenging, especially for those without reliable transportation options.</li>
    <li>Flexibility: A single parent has to juggle a lot of things at once, which could interfere with their jobs or their personal lives especially when there is no support system around.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Single Parenting Survival Tips</h3>
   <p>Although single parenting can be a difficult journey, there are some steps that can be taken to help ease the challenges. From Rachel's experience and other single parents, here are some survivors tips:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>A strong support system: this could be family members, friends or single parent groups. Seeking out support early on and building a network of people can significantly help during this time.</li>
    <li>Create a schedule and stick to it as much as possible. From meal times to bedtimes, creating a routine can help provide structure and consistency for your children.</li>
    <li>Prioritize self-care: By taking care of yourself, emotionally and physically, you become a better parent overall. Taking care of yourself first allows you to be the best version of yourself for your children.</li>
    <li>Watch your finances: Knowing your budget and cutting back on unnecessary expenses can help make ends meet and allow you to prioritize important things like housing, healthcare, food and childcare expenses.</li>
    <li>Involve your children: Include your children in chores and everyday routines, such as grocery shopping, as it helps build their confidence and develop their sense of independence.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>In Conclusion</h3>
   <p>Single parenting is a challenging journey, especially for those who didn't expect to be in this situation. However, single parents can thrive in this role, as Rachel has shown in her new book. Rachel shares stories of resilience and inspiration from her experience to encourage other single parents like her, showing that single parenting can be fulfilling, although difficult.</p>
   <p>Key takeaways for single parents include creating a stable environment for your children, prioritizing self-care, involving your children in routines, seeking out support and building a strong network, and being aware of your finances.</p>
