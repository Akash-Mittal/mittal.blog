  <p>Have you ever experienced the pain of being estranged from your adult child? If you have, then you are not alone. Estrangement between parents and their adult children has become a modern-day epidemic that affects millions of families worldwide.</p>
  
  <p>Let's start with an interesting story. Jane was a loving mother of three adult children. She had always been supportive of her children and had provided them with everything they needed. However, when her youngest son graduated from college, he moved to a different state and became distant. He stopped answering her calls and texts, and she couldn't understand why.</p>
  <p>Months turned into years, and Jane's son had completely cut her off from his life. She was devastated and didn't know how to cope with the pain of losing her child. But, through support groups and therapy, Jane was able to come to terms with the situation and find some peace.</p>
  
  <p>The statistics on adult child estrangement are alarming. According to a study published in the Journal of Family Psychology, up to 40% of parents in the US have experienced estrangement from at least one adult child. In the UK, a similar study found that nearly 8% of parents were estranged from one or more of their adult children.</p>
  <p>These numbers are only increasing, and it's important to understand why this is happening.</p>
