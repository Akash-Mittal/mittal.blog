    <p>As a child, I spent countless hours watching Disney movies and shows. Little did I know that as an adult, I would still turn to Disney for parenting advice.</p>
    <p>Recently, I was struggling with teaching my son the importance of honesty. That's when I remembered the story of Pinocchio, where he learned that lying would make his nose grow. I used the story to explain to my son that lying only brings consequences and isn't worth it in the end.</p>
    <p>My personal experience is just one example of the many ways that families turn to Disney for parenting advice.</p>
    
    <p>According to a study by the Oh My Disney Fan Club, 75% of parents believe that Disney provides helpful messages and values for children. Additionally, 85% of parents believe that Disney movies and shows have taught their children important life lessons.</p>
    <p>Another example is the success of Disney's Parenting content on their website. The section offers articles and resources on various parenting topics such as education, health, family vacations, and more. The page receives over 1.5 million unique visitors a month, proving that parents are actively seeking advice from Disney.</p>
    <h2>Why Families are Turning to Disney</h2>
    <p>Disney has been around for over 90 years and has become an iconic brand, creating memorable stories and lovable characters. Their stories often feature relatable themes and messages that resonate with both children and adults. Parents feel comfortable using Disney as a source of advice because they trust the brand and their values.</p>
    
    <p>One mother, Sarah, shared with me her experience of using Disney to help her daughter deal with anxiety. After watching Inside Out, her daughter was able to understand and express her emotions better, which helped her handle her anxiety in a healthier way. Sarah said, "Disney movies teach kids resilience, the importance of being kind, how to handle failures, and great leadership skills."</p>
