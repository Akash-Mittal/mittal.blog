   <p>The Delhi government is all set to organise a theatre festival for children from June 15, 2021. The festival, which will be held virtually due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, aims to promote theatre as a medium of education and entertainment among children.</p>
   <h2>Interesting Story</h2>
   <p>The idea of organising a theatre festival for children was inspired by a group of students from a government school in Delhi who had enacted a play on the life of Mahatma Gandhi during a school event. The play was highly appreciated by the audience, and the teachers realised the potential of theatre as a means to sensitize children about social issues and values.</p>
   
   <blockquote>
    "Research has shown that exposure to theatre among children helps in developing their cognitive, emotional, and social skills. It also improves their language and communication skills, boosts creativity, and enhances their confidence and self-esteem," said a spokesperson from the Delhi government.
   </blockquote>
   <p>The theatre festival will feature a diverse range of plays, including adaptations of literary works, folk tales, and original stories. The festival will also provide a platform for young talent and emerging theatre groups to showcase their skills and creativity.</p>

The play is being produced by a group of young theatre enthusiasts who were inspired by the book's message of compassion, empathy, and love. According to the director of the play, "The Little Prince is not just a children's book, it's a book for all ages. It teaches us to see the world through the eyes of a child and connect with our inner selves."</p>
