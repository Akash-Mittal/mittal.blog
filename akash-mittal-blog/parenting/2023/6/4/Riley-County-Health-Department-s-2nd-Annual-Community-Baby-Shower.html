    <h2>Why the Community Baby Shower Matters</h2>
    <p>As she looked down at her newborn baby girl, Sarah felt overwhelmed. She was excited but also scared about being a new parent. She was relieved, however, to know that she could turn to the Riley County Health Department for help. That's why she and her husband attended the department's 2nd annual community baby shower.</p>
    <p>The event brought together new and expecting parents, grandparents and caregivers with local organizations and businesses that offer resources and support for growing families. The booths showcased everything from healthy food and prenatal vitamins for pregnant women to baby clothes and toys for infants. The event also featured guest speakers and interactive activities such as diaper-changing and baby-wearing demonstrations, as well as a raffle with prizes such as strollers and car seats.</p>
    <p>"The baby shower was so informative and helpful," says Sarah. "We learned about important things like breastfeeding, car seat safety and infant sleep safety. We also got to meet other families in the community who are going through the same things we are. It made us feel less alone and more supported."</p>

    <h2>The Impact of the Community Baby Shower</h2>
    <p>The community baby shower is just one of the many ways the Riley County Health Department is working to improve the health and well-being of its residents. By bringing together families and local organizations, the event helps to break down barriers and increase access to resources and services. It also helps to foster a sense of community and support among families who may feel isolated or overwhelmed.</p>
    <p>Since the first community baby shower in 2019, the event has grown both in attendance and impact. Last year, over 200 families attended the event, and this year's event is expected to draw an even larger crowd. Through surveys and feedback forms, the department has also been able to track the impact of the event on families. Here are just a few examples:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>98% of attendees reported learning something new about pregnancy, childbirth or infant care</li>
     <li>87% of attendees reported connecting with a local organization or business that offers resources for growing families</li>
     <li>76% of attendees reported feeling more confident in their ability to care for their baby</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These numbers demonstrate the value of the community baby shower in supporting and empowering new and growing families.</p>

    <h2>What You Can Do to Support Expecting and Growing Families</h2>
    <p>Even if you're not a new or expecting parent, there are many ways you can support and empower families in your community:</p>

     <li>Donate gently used baby clothes, toys and furniture to local organizations that provide resources for families in need.</li>
     <li>Offer to babysit or help out with household chores for a friend or neighbor who is a new parent.</li>
     <li>Volunteer your time or resources to local organizations that support families, such as food banks, shelters or parenting classes.</li>
     <li>Advocate for policies and programs that support families, such as paid family leave or affordable child care.</li>
