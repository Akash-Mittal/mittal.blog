    <section id="Examples">
     <h2>Examples of Effective Parenting</h2>
     <p>There are many examples of effective parenting out there. Here are a few:</p>
     <ul>
      <li><strong>Setting a Good Example:</strong> Children learn by example. If parents want their children to behave in a certain way, they need to model that behavior themselves. This means treating others with respect, being honest, and owning up to mistakes.</li>
      <li><strong>Active Listening:</strong> Effective parents listen to their children and take their concerns seriously. They don't dismiss their children's feelings or problems as insignificant. Instead, they try to understand where their children are coming from and offer support and guidance.</li>
      <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Consistency is key when it comes to discipline. Effective parents set clear expectations and consequences for their children's behavior, and they follow through on those consequences. This helps children understand the importance of rules and boundaries.</li>
      <li><strong>Encouragement:</strong> Effective parents encourage their children to try new things and take risks. They provide support and guidance, but they also allow their children to make their own decisions and learn from their mistakes.</li>
     </ul>
