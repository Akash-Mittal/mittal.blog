   <p>It's no secret that Drew Scott and his wife Linda Phan are proud parents to their son, whom they adoringly call "Little Drew". Recently, Linda Phan shared a heartwarming video on Instagram of her son's reaction to a bouquet of flowers.</p><img src="flower-reaction.jpg" alt="Little Drew's reaction to flowers">

As soon as he spots the flowers, his face lights up with joy and excitement. He claps his hands and says "wow" repeatedly, clearly in awe of the colorful blooms. Linda can be heard in the background saying "are those flowers for Mommy? Oh no, they're for Little Drew, because he's such a good boy."</p>
