   <p>Do you always want to know what your children are doing? Do you want to protect them from harm at any cost? If your answer is yes, then you might need to re-evaluate your parenting style. The latest episode of Black Mirror, called "Arkangel", tells the story of a mother who implants a tracking device in her daughter's brain to monitor her every move.</p>
   <h2>A Quantifiable Example of Toxic Parenting</h2>
   <p>This episode provides a chilling portrayal of how overprotective parents can become toxic to their children's wellbeing. While the technology used in the show is fictional, the idea behind it is not far-fetched. Many parents today use GPS trackers, monitoring apps, and other devices to keep track of their children's whereabouts, online activity, and more.</p>
   <p>According to a recent study by Common Sense Media, 61% of parents said they checked their children's social media accounts to see what they were posting and who they were interacting with. Another study by McAfee found that 70% of teens said their parents monitored their online activity.</p>
   <p>While some level of monitoring can be beneficial, especially in preventing cyberbullying, the line between protection and invasion of privacy is often blurred. Children need their own space, privacy, and independence to develop their own identity and learn from their mistakes. Overprotective parenting can create a sense of anxiety, dependency, and mistrust, leading to long-term emotional and psychological issues.</p>
   <h2>A Personal Anecdote of Toxic Parenting</h2>
   <p>I had a friend who was raised by overprotective parents. She wasn't allowed to go out with her friends, travel alone, or even choose her own clothes. Her parents believed that they were protecting her from harm, but in reality, they were crippling her social skills, self-esteem, and ability to make her own decisions.</p>
   <p>Eventually, my friend rebelled against her parents and moved out of their house as soon as she turned 18. She struggled to adjust to the real world and the consequences of her actions, but over time, she gained confidence and independence. Now, she is a successful businesswoman who values her freedom and privacy.</p>
