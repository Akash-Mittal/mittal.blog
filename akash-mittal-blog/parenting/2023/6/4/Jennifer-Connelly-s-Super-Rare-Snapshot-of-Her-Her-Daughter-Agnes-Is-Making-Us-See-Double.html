  <p class="intro">Jennifer Connelly, the Academy Award-winning actress, recently shared a super rare snapshot of her and her daughter, Agnes, on Instagram. The photo shows the uncanny resemblance between the mother and daughter as they both have the same sharp jawline, high cheekbones, and piercing blue eyes. As expected, the post quickly went viral, and many fans were amazed by how alike the two looked. But what made this post even more special is the fact that Jennifer rarely shares pictures of her family on social media.</p><!--Section 1: The Power of Genetics-->
  <h2 class="section-title">The Power of Genetics</h2>
  <p>One cannot overlook the striking resemblance between Jennifer Connelly and her daughter, Agnes. The power of genetics is such that children often take after their parents' features, which can be seen in Agnes' case. Despite coming from different backgrounds, genes play a significant role in determining the physical attributes of a child.</p>
  <p>A study conducted by the National Human Genome Research Institute found that genetics account for approximately 80% of height and 50% of weight. This means that a child's physical traits, such as height, weight, eye color, hair color, and facial features, are mostly determined by genetics.</p>
  <p>For Jennifer Connelly and her daughter, the resemblance is uncanny, proving how genes can play an instrumental role in shaping a person's physical features.</p><!--Section 2: The Importance of Family Time-->

  <p>Studies have shown that family time has a profound impact on a child's development. Children who spend quality time with their families tend to have better cognitive, emotional, and social development. Moreover, family time helps build stronger bonds between family members, which can have lifelong benefits.</p>
  <p>There are many ways to spend meaningful time with family, from going on outings and vacations to playing board games or cooking together. Whatever the activity, the key is to make it a priority and spend time with the people who matter most.</p><!--Section 3: The Beauty of Motherhood-->
