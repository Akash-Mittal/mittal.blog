    <p>Do you remember watching Disney movies as a child and thinking that the characters were your role models? It turns out that many parents today still feel the same way. In fact, families are increasingly relying on Disney for parenting advice.</p>
    <p>Take Maria, for instance. She is a mother of two young children and says that she uses Disney movies as a tool to teach her children valuable life lessons. "My kids respond really well to the characters and stories," she says. "They listen more when it comes from Mickey Mouse or Elsa than when it comes from me."</p>
    <p>Maria is not alone. Many parents have turned to Disney movies, television shows, and theme parks as a way to teach their children about things like honesty, friendship, and perseverance. And the trend shows no signs of slowing down.</p>
