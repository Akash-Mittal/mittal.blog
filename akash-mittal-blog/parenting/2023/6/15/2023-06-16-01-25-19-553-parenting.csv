Having a newborn can be both exciting and exhausting. Your little bundle of joy requires around-the-clock attention and care. To help make life with a newborn a little bit easier, here are 10 parenting hacks that you can use:
Baby wraps are a great way to keep your baby close and comforted while freeing up your hands to do other things. There are many different types of wraps available, so be sure to find one that is comfortable for you and your baby.
White noise can help soothe your baby and help them fall asleep. There are many apps and machines available that can play white noise, or you can download a white noise track from the internet.
A diaper caddy is a portable and convenient way to keep all of your diaper-changing supplies in one place. You can easily carry it from room to room and always have everything you need close at hand.
If you are planning on pumping breastmilk, a hands-free pumping bra is a must-have. It allows you to pump and multitask at the same time, which can be a huge time-saver.
A nursing pillow helps to support your baby in a comfortable position while breastfeeding. It can also reduce strain on your back and arms.
A baby swing can be a lifesaver when you need to soothe a fussy or overtired baby. It can also give you a break when you need to take care of something else.
Similar to a baby wrap, a baby carrier is a comfortable and convenient way to carry your baby with you while keeping your hands free.
A baby care station is a designated area where you keep all of your baby supplies organized and within easy reach. It can save you time and reduce stress when you need to quickly find something.
A baby monitor gives you peace of mind while your baby is sleeping or playing in another room. There are many different types of monitors available, including audio and video monitors.

When we hear about celebrities who have children together and then split up, we often wonder what happens next. It can be challenging for anyone to co-parent successfully, but it's especially difficult when you're dealing with the pressures of the public spotlight. So, when two high-profile Hollywood stars share their experiences of co-parenting, it's worth paying attention.
Two such stars are Jennifer Garner and Sheryl Lee Ralph. Garner, known for her roles in Alias and 13 Going on 30, was married to actor Ben Affleck and shares three children with him. Ralph, an actress and singer perhaps best known for her role in Moesha, has a son with her ex-husband Eric Maurice. Both women have been open about their experiences of co-parenting with their exes, and they have some valuable insights to share with us all.
One of the most difficult aspects of co-parenting with an ex is learning to communicate in a way that is respectful and productive. This can be especially challenging if there has been a lot of hurt and resentment in the relationship, or if one person is more interested in pursuing their own needs than in putting the children first. Garner acknowledges that ""co-parenting takes two people to do it well for it to be successful,"" and that it requires both parties to put aside their own issues and work together for the sake of the children.
Ralph agrees, saying that ""it's important to remember that the focus should always be on the child, not the parent's past relationship."" She stresses the importance of not speaking badly about the other parent in front of the child, and of finding a way to be civil and respectful, even if you don't like or trust your ex anymore.
So, what are some practical tips for making co-parenting work? Here are a few insights from Garner and Ralph:
In conclusion, co-parenting after a divorce can be incredibly challenging, but it's possible to make it work if both parties are committed to putting the children first. It requires effective communication, respect for each other's opinions, and a willingness to compromise. As Jennifer Garner and Sheryl Lee Ralph demonstrate, even high-profile celebrities can make co-parenting work if they prioritize their children's needs over their own.
Their advice boils down to this: be respectful, communicate often and effectively, and put the children first. If you can do those things, you'll be well on your way to successful co-parenting.

Imagine that you're at a slot machine in a casino. Every time you pull the lever, there's a 50-50 chance that you'll win some money. You know that the odds aren't in your favor, but that doesn't stop you from pulling the lever again and again.
Why? Because every time you pull the lever, your brain releases a chemical called dopamine, which is associated with pleasure and reward. Even if you don't win anything, the anticipation of a potential reward is enough to stimulate your brain's pleasure centers.
Now, imagine that you're a child. Every time you play a video game or check your phone, you get a similar hit of dopamine. The constant stimulation can create a neural pathway in your brain that associates pleasure with screen time.
While dopamine plays an important role in our brain's reward system, over-stimulation can lead to addictive behavior. When children are constantly exposed to screens, their brains can become 'hijacked'; they begin to crave the dopamine hit associated with technology rather than seeking pleasure from real-life experiences.
This can manifest in a number of ways. Some children become irritable or agitated when they're separated from their screens, while others struggle to engage in activities that don't provide an immediate dopamine hit. This phenomenon is particularly worrying because it can be difficult to reverse.
That's where 'anti-dopamine parenting' comes in. By actively combating the addictive qualities of technology and encouraging children to engage in healthy habits, parents can help fight against hijacked neural pathways.
So, how can parents combat the addictive qualities of technology? Here are a few strategies:
By actively combating the addictive qualities of technology, parents can help their children develop healthy habits and prevent the formation of hijacked neural pathways. In doing so, children can experience a range of benefits:
Ultimately, the goal of anti-dopamine parenting isn't to banish technology altogether, but rather to create a healthy balance and foster real-life experiences that are fulfilling and rewarding in their own right. By doing so, parents can help their children win the battle against hijacked neural pathways and cultivate healthy habits for life.

It's every parent's nightmare - trying to get your kid to brush their teeth. You don't want them to lose their baby teeth too early, and you certainly don't want them suffering from cavities and dental problems, but getting them to cooperate can be a major battle.
That's why I've come up with a solution that has worked for me as a parenting expert and for many of my clients. I discovered an easy way to clean your kids' teeth without having to battle with toothbrush and paste.
Let me share with you some quantifiable examples. According to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 19% of children aged 2-19 years old have untreated dental cavities. This is a staggering number that can be reduced with proper dental care techniques. In addition, dental treatment can be expensive, with costs ranging from $50 for a routine check-up to $300 or more for a filling.
So, what is this easy way to clean your kids' teeth? It's simple, really. All you need is a pack of dental wipes. These are specially-designed wipes that clean your child's teeth and mouth safely and effectively.
But, why use dental wipes instead of the traditional toothbrush and toothpaste? For one, dental wipes are easier to use and more convenient. They come in a compact pack that you can carry around with you, so you can clean your child's teeth anytime, anywhere. Plus, unlike toothpaste, dental wipes don't require rinsing, making them ideal for on-the-go use. Additionally, dental wipes are made with safe and natural ingredients, so you don't have to worry about your child ingesting harmful chemicals.
Here are some practical tips for using dental wipes:
But don't just take my word for it. Here are some personal anecdotes and case studies from parents who have tried dental wipes:
""My daughter hates brushing her teeth. It always turns into a big fight. But she loves using the dental wipes. It's not as messy as toothpaste and it's quick and easy. She even reminds me to give her a wipe after meals!""
""I was skeptical at first, but the dental wipes have been a lifesaver for us. Our son has braces and it's difficult for him to keep his teeth clean. The wipes have made a big difference in his oral health, and they're much easier to use than dental floss or a water pick.""
In conclusion, here are three key takeaways:

Being a father can be one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences a man can have. It requires dedication, patience, and love. Unfortunately, many fathers find themselves struggling to balance their responsibilities at work and home, which can take a toll on their mental and emotional well-being. That's where UAMS' Fatherhood FIRE Program comes in.
The Fatherhood FIRE Program, which stands for Families Involved in Reaching Education, is designed to help fathers in Northwest Arkansas become more engaged in their children's lives. The program's mission is to:
The program is open to all fathers in the Northwest Arkansas area and is completely free of charge.
The Fatherhood FIRE Program offers a variety of activities that are designed to support fathers and their families. These activities include:
All of these activities are designed to help fathers grow and develop, both as individuals and as parents. By providing opportunities for fathers to learn new skills and connect with other fathers, the program helps to create a sense of community and support that is vital for long-term success.
Since its inception, the Fatherhood FIRE Program has helped hundreds of fathers in Northwest Arkansas become more engaged in their children's lives. Here are some of the program's quantifiable results:
These results demonstrate the powerful impact that the program is having on fathers and their families. By providing support, guidance, and resources, the Fatherhood FIRE Program is helping to create stronger, more resilient families in Northwest Arkansas.
While the quantifiable results are impressive, the true value of the Fatherhood FIRE Program can be seen in the personal stories of the fathers who have participated in the program. Take Jerry, for example. Jerry is a single father of two who was struggling to balance his job as a truck driver with his responsibilities at home. He knew that he wanted to be a better father, but he didn't know how to do it.
One day, Jerry heard about the Fatherhood FIRE Program from a friend. He was hesitant at first, but he decided to give it a try. He attended one of the program's parenting workshops and was amazed by how much he learned. He immediately put his new skills into practice and started spending more quality time with his children.
Over time, Jerry became more involved in the program and started attending other workshops and seminars. He even volunteered to help with some of the program's community service project

Co-parenting can be challenging, but with the right attitude and mindset, it can also be a fulfilling experience. In a recent interview, Hollywood actresses Jennifer Garner and Sheryl Lee Ralph shared their thoughts and tips on healthy co-parenting.
Jennifer Garner, who co-parents her three children with her ex-husband Ben Affleck, emphasizes the importance of putting the children's needs first. She says, ""You have to be together for your kids and put them first, no matter what.""
A specific example she shared was about their youngest child's birthday party. Even though she and Affleck were separated at that time, they still organized a joint party to celebrate their child's special day. Garner says, ""We all need to be able to say, 'I think we can do this together.' I think that's the best way, if you can manage it.""
Sheryl Lee Ralph, who co-parents her son with her ex-husband Eric Maurice, talks about the importance of consistency and communication in co-parenting. She says, ""It's important to have the same rules in both households, so it's not confusing for the child.""
She also emphasizes the role of communication in co-parenting. Ralph says, ""Communication is key. You have to make the phone calls, you have to make the effort.""
Based on their experiences, Garner and Ralph offer the following tips for healthy co-parenting:
Garner shares a personal anecdote about how she and Affleck worked together to help their son overcome his fear of swimming. She says, ""We both had to get in the pool with him, because he was so scared. And I kept saying, 'Daddy is holding on to you, Daddy is holding on to you.' And then he held on to me.""
Ralph talks about how she and her ex-husband worked through their differences and focused on their son's well-being. She says, ""We decided to be unified in our parenting, because we loved our child more than we hated each other.""
Garner suggests that co-parents should make an effort to attend their children's activities and events together. She says, ""Your kids will appreciate that you stood next to each other for their soccer game or gymnastics meet or whatever it is. It's just worth it.""
Ralph advises co-parents to plan ahead and coordinate schedules to avoid conflicts. She says, ""You have to plan ahead and know what each other's schedules are, so you're not leaving the child stranded. It's not about you, it's about the child.""

Do you remember watching Disney movies as a child and thinking that the characters were your role models? It turns out that many parents today still feel the same way. In fact, families are increasingly relying on Disney for parenting advice.
Take Maria, for instance. She is a mother of two young children and says that she uses Disney movies as a tool to teach her children valuable life lessons. ""My kids respond really well to the characters and stories,"" she says. ""They listen more when it comes from Mickey Mouse or Elsa than when it comes from me.""
Maria is not alone. Many parents have turned to Disney movies, television shows, and theme parks as a way to teach their children about things like honesty, friendship, and perseverance. And the trend shows no signs of slowing down.

When my son was about six years old, we were visiting my parents at their house. While we were there, my dad wandered off into the backyard to do some gardening. My son, who was always curious and loved to follow people around to see what they were doing, followed him outside.
A little while later, I went outside to check on them and found my son sitting on the ground next to my dad, intently watching as he dug holes and planted flowers. I smiled as I watched them for a few minutes, feeling grateful that my dad was such a wonderful influence on my son.
This small moment encapsulates so much of what I believe parenting done right looks like. It's about passing on skills and values to the next generation, spending quality time together, and being a positive role model.
Of course, every family is different, and what works for one might not work for another. But here are a few quantifiable examples of what parenting done right can look like:

From the outside, Kate Middleton's life might look perfect. As a member of the Royal Family, she lives in a palace, wears designer clothes, and travels the world. But behind closed doors, Kate's childhood was far from idyllic. She was bullied in school, and those years of unhappiness have shaped the way she raises her own children.
As a child, Kate attended the exclusive Marlborough College in Wiltshire, where she struggled to fit in. Other students made fun of her accent and her family's middle-class background, and she reportedly spent a lot of time alone in her dorm room. Now, as a mother of three, Kate is determined to make sure her own children don't have the same experience.
One of the ways Kate has been influenced by her school years is in how she talks to her children about their feelings. She has been vocal about her own struggles with anxiety and has encouraged her kids to be open and honest with her about how they're feeling. In an interview with Garnett magazine, she said, ""It's important to talk openly about mental health, and the earlier we can start these conversations, the better.""
Another example of how Kate's school years have influenced her parenting is in the activities she chooses for her children. She's known for taking them on nature walks and playing with them in the garden, which could be seen as a reaction to the structured environment of Marlborough College. By encouraging her children to explore and play in a more natural setting, she's giving them the freedom to be themselves and enjoy childhood.
One example of how Kate's parenting style has resonated with others is with a mother named Elizabeth, who has a daughter with anxiety. Elizabeth says that reading about Kate's struggles with anxiety has helped her feel less alone and inspired her to talk more openly with her daughter about the topic.
Another example is with a family who started going on nature walks after seeing photos of Kate doing the same with her kids. They say that exploring the outdoors together has brought them closer as a family and has given their kids a newfound appreciation for nature.

Kelly Clarkson, the Grammy-award winning singer and talk show host, recently opened up about her experiences as a parent on Glennon Doyle's podcast, ""We Can Do Hard Things.""
Clarkson, who shares two children with her ex-husband Brandon Blackstock, spoke candidly about the challenges of co-parenting and balancing work and family life.
During the podcast, Clarkson shared several anecdotes that illustrate the ups and downs of parenting. One particularly challenging moment came when she was on tour and her daughter, River, who was just three years old at the time, was struggling with separation anxiety.
Clarkson said that she was in the middle of a concert when she received a message from Blackstock that read, ""You need to FaceTime her right now."" When she did, she found River hysterical and inconsolable.
""It was so hard because it was such a pivotal moment,"" Clarkson said. ""I hadn't had a moment like that yet with my child, where they were that hysterical and that heartbroken. I didn't know what to do.""
Clarkson eventually got River to calm down and go to sleep, but the incident left a lasting impression.
""I just remember thinking, 'I don't know how single parents do it,'"" she said.
In addition to the challenges of co-parenting, Clarkson also shared some of the joys of being a mom. One highlight was when her son, Remington, who was just two years old at the time, started singing along to her songs on the radio.
""He'll be in his car seat in the back and he'll just scream, 'I love you!' It's the sweetest thing ever,"" she said.
Throughout the podcast, Clarkson also offered some practical advice for parents who might be struggling with the same challenges she has faced.

How Reality TV Can Be Deceptive And The Importance of Quantifiable Evidence
Reality star Kim Zolciak has been in a media frenzy after her ex-husband and former NFL player Kroy Biermann claims that she was neglecting their children due to her busy schedule. The pair share four children together - Brielle, 23, Ariana, 19, Kaia, 7, and Kane, 6.
Zolciak has always denied all the allegations and refused to entertain them until now. In a recent interview, she addressed the rumors around her parenting and shared some quantifiable evidence that would make anyone rethink their stance on her parenting style.
Zolciak pointed out that her children have always been well-fed, well-dressed and never lacked in anything. She went further to reveal that she has hired a nanny who tracks everything from their food schedule to the amount of sleep they get. Zolciak also provided receipts showing that she spends over $10,000 on groceries alone every month. She pointed out that she has a chef on-call who prepares fresh and organic meals for her children.
In addition, Zolciak revealed that she has a contract with an educational program for her two youngest children, where they receive one-on-one educational instruction for four hours every day.
Lastly, she shared that all her children have private rooms in her home that are customized to fit their interests and hobbies, including an arcade room for the older two. She also revealed that they've traveled extensively and have been exposed to diverse cultures, which have broadened their perspectives at a young age.
The reality TV world can be deceptive, and it's hard to know what is staged or what is made for good TV ratings. In this particular case, it's crucial to have quantifiable evidence because of the seriousness of the accusations made. It's easy to make damaging claims, but without evidence, they remain baseless and only cause harm.
It's also essential to remember that being a good parent doesn't depend on being a stay-at-home mom or having the perfect balance of work and home life. Being a good parent means providing a safe and nourishing environment that supports your children's growth and development. As demonstrated by Zolciak's evidence, her children have all the basic necessities plus more, and it's essential to acknowledge that as a vital aspect of her parenting style.
Another crucial aspect is the importance of respecting boundaries when it comes to co-parenting. It's easy for emotions to get the best of us, bu

In this particular case, it's crucial to have quantifiable evidence because of the seriousness of the accusations made. It's easy to make damaging claims, but without evidence, they remain baseless and only cause harm.
It's also essential to remember that being a good parent doesn't depend on being a stay-at-home mom or having the perfect balance of work and home life. Being a good parent means providing a safe and nourishing environment that supports your children's growth and development. As demonstrated by Zolciak's evidence, her children have all the basic necessities plus more, and it's essential to acknowledge that as a vital aspect of her parenting style.
Another crucial aspect is the importance of respecting boundaries when it comes to co-parenting. It's easy for emotions to get the best of us, but it's essential to focus on what's best for the children and not use them as leverage against the other parent. Children need both parents in their lives, and hostility only contributes to a toxic environment, which is harmful to their growth and development.

Reality star defends herself against husband's accusations in public announcement
Kim Zolciak, the star of reality TV show ""Don't Be Tardy,"" has responded to her husband Kroy Biermann's recent criticisms of her parenting in a strong statement shared with her fans and followers on social media. According to Zolciak, Biermann had publicly called into question her ability to raise their six children during an argument, leading her to feel the need to defend herself.
During the argument, which occurred off camera, Biermann reportedly accused Zolciak of being too lenient with their children's discipline, failing to enforce boundaries, and spending too much time on her phone instead of being a present parent.
In her statement, Zolciak denied Biermann's accusations and defended her parenting style by saying that she is ""a present mother, always taking care of everybody."" She also stated that their parenting styles differ because of their differing childhoods - Zolciak grew up in a household with a single mother, while Biermann's parents were married.
""Kroy and I do not have the same childhood background,"" Zolciak wrote. ""I came from a single mother and strived to give my children a completely different life than I had. I always put my children and my family first, but that doesn't mean that I am not human, and that doesn't mean that I don't make mistakes.""
Zolciak acknowledged that she is not a perfect parent, but emphasized that she is always learning and growing as a mom. She encouraged her followers to ""support and uplift each other"" rather than tear each other down with judgment and criticism.
The situation between Zolciak and Biermann highlights the importance of effective communication and co-parenting, especially in blended families. Here are some practical tips for navigating co-parenting relationships:

Imagine being the parent of a child with Angelman Syndrome. Caring for a child with this rare neuro-genetic disorder is a challenging and overwhelming task. The child's speech and motor skills are severely delayed, and they experience difficulty in sleeping, eating and communicating. Their care requires frequent hospital visits, therapy, and constant supervision. Consequently, parents often have to leave their jobs to care for their children. In this article, we explore the lost productivity that parenting a child with Angelman Syndrome costs the parents and the economy at large.
The cost of lost productivity from parenting a child with Angelman Syndrome are staggering. In the United States alone, caring for children with the syndrome is projected to cost up to $3.5 million in lost productivity over the life of each child. This is according to a recent study published in the Journal of Clinical Economics.
The study estimates that families are losing over 1.5 million hours of paid work per year, which translates to nearly $31 billion in lost productivity over the children's lifetimes. This figure was calculated based on assumptions that each parent would have worked for 25 years at an average wage of $27.50 per hour.
Angelina Falconi, a mother of a child with Angelman Syndrome, shared her expenses since her child's birth. ""My daughter is 9 years old, and so far, we have spent over $250,000 on medical procedures, physical therapy, speech therapy, and special education. I had to leave my job to take care of her, which has cost our family approximately $750,000 in lost wages. We are doing everything we can to provide her with the best care possible."" Her experience is not unique, as many parents have had to make similar sacrifices in order to care for their children.

When Emily and Jack realized that they wanted children, they knew that traditional family models did not fit them. They had met in college and became best friends, but there was no romantic chemistry between them. They had both had failed relationships in the past and did not want to rush into such a commitment. They wanted to take their time to find the perfect partner, but they also did not want to miss the chance of becoming parents. That's when they discovered platonic co-parenting.
Platonic co-parenting is a model in which two (or more) people, who are not romantically involved, decide to have and raise a child/children together.

The idea of platonic co-parenting is not new, but it is becoming more visible and accepted. Here are some examples of famous people who have embraced this model:
These examples show that platonic co-parenting can work for different types of people and situations.

Of course, co-parenting also has its challenges, such as legal, financial, and emotional issues. But with proper planning, communication, and support, these challenges can be overcome.
If you are considering platonic co-parenting, here are some tips to help you make the best out of this model:
These tips are not exhaustive and may vary depending on your situation, but they can give you a sense of what to expect and how to prepare for platonic co-parenting.

However, Princess Beatrice had someone to look up to, her cousin-in-law, The Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton. When Kate became a mother in 2013, she changed the traditional royal parenting narrative with her hands-on approach. From natural birth to breastfeeding and from diaper duty to school drop-offs, Kate did it all herself. She showed everyone that being a royal doesn't mean you can't be a loving and involved parent.

By taking a more modern approach to parenting, Princess Beatrice is setting an example for the royal family and people around the world. Here are three benefits of modern parenting:

It was a typical Friday evening when the Probate & Family Court received an urgent call from a 10-year-old child named Lily. She was hysterically crying and said that she could not find her mother who had been missing for hours. The authorities were immediately alerted and after a few hours of relentless searching, Lily's mother was found dead in a nearby park.
The investigation revealed that Lily's mother had been struggling with mental health issues and had lost custody of her daughter due to her inability to provide a safe environment for her child. Despite this, she was still allowed regular parenting time with her daughter, which she had used to take her to the park and commit suicide, leaving poor Lily traumatized and alone.
This is just one example of the potentially horrific consequences of inadequate parenting time supervision. Fortunately, the Probate & Family Court has recently issued new guidelines to ensure the safety and well-being of children during parenting time.
The new guidelines emphasize the importance of proper supervision during parenting time and provide clear instructions for parenting time supervisors. These guidelines are applicable in all cases where the court orders supervised parenting time and aim to ensure that children are kept safe and protected during such visits.
The guidelines cover a range of issues, including:
In the year prior to the issuance of these guidelines, the Probate & Family Court received 78 complaints related to inadequate parenting time supervision. These complaints ranged from simple infractions such as late arrivals or early departures, to more serious issues like neglect and abuse of the children during the visits.
Since the implementation of the new guidelines, the number of complaints has dropped significantly, with only 12 recorded in the following year. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the court's efforts in ensuring that proper supervision is provided during parenting time.
The Probate & Family Court's new guidelines for parenting time supervisors are a welcome development that will help protect children from potential harm during supervised visits with non-custodial parents or caretakers. Proper supervision during these times is crucial in providing a safe and healthy environment for children to maintain relationships with their parents and loved ones.
In conclusion, these guidelines are important because:

It was a typical day in 2050 when I received a call from my daughter's school. The holographic display on my wrist showed the principal's face and I answered the call with a tap. ""Hi there, Mrs. Johnson,"" the principal said. ""I just wanted to let you know that your daughter got an 'A' on her space travel project. She did a great job presenting her research on the benefits and challenges of intergalactic tourism.""
This futuristic scene may seem far-fetched, but we are already seeing the emergence of technologies that will shape the way we parent in the future. For instance, the use of virtual and augmented reality in education will allow children to explore new worlds and ideas without ever leaving their homes. Artificial intelligence will help parents track their child's academic progress in real-time and identify areas where they may need extra support. And wearable technology will enable parents to always keep an eye on their children's health and safety.
If you think these advancements sound exciting, then you're not alone. Parents all over the world are eager to see what the future of parenting holds. @thatindianchick_ gives us a hilarious glimpse into this future in her latest book, ""Parenting 2050: The Ultimate Guide to Raising Superhumans"".
In her book, @thatindianchick_ shares personal anecdotes and case studies to illustrate her points about the future of parenting. She also provides practical tips when possible, such as how to use technology to make parenting easier and how to prepare children for a world that is constantly evolving.

How My Dad Changed My Life
It was a sunny day in the summer of 1996. I was eight years old, and my dad had promised to take me to the park to teach me how to ride a bike. I was so excited, because I had been waiting for this moment for weeks.
We got to the park, and my dad started to assemble the bike. I watched him with curiosity, wondering how he knew how to put it together so easily. But he just smiled and said, ""Son, I used to ride bikes all the time when I was your age. It's like riding a horse, you never forget how to do it.""
So, I got on the bike, and my dad held onto the back to help me balance. At first, I was wobbly and scared, but he kept encouraging me and telling me that I could do it. And before I knew it, I was riding on my own. I felt free and exhilarated, like I was flying.
From that day on, my dad and I went on bike rides all the time. It became our special activity, and it was a way for us to bond and connect. We would ride for hours, exploring the city and discovering new trails and parks. And every time we rode, it reminded me of that first day at the park, when my dad believed in me and helped me conquer my fear.
My dad's influence didn't just stop at teaching me how to ride a bike. He taught me many valuable life lessons that have stayed with me to this day. For example:
One personal anecdote that illustrates my dad's impact on my life is the story of how he helped me overcome my fear of public speaking. I used to dread speaking in front of my class and would get so nervous that I would forget my lines. But one day, my dad took me aside and gave me some advice. He told me to imagine that the audience was a group of my close friends and to speak to them as if I was having a conversation. He also reminded me that everyone gets nervous and that it's okay to make mistakes.
I took his advice and practiced my speech in front of him. He listened patiently and gave me feedback, telling me what parts were strong and what parts needed work. When the day of the presentation arrived, I felt confident and well-prepared. And when I finished, my classmates applauded and complimented me on my performance. It was a huge win for me, and I was grateful to my dad for his guidance and support.
If you want to impart life lessons to your children like my dad did, here are some practical tips:

At twenty-one, Holly had a lot on her plate when she found out she was pregnant. She had always hoped to go to college and pursue her dream of becoming a nurse, but now it seemed like her plans were coming apart. Unsure of her choices, she started to feel like she was drowning in a sea of doubt and uncertainty.
One day, she heard about the Puaw?nanga Teen Parenting Unit in Masterton, New Zealand, and decided to give it a try.

As a former resident and volunteer at Puaw?nanga, I can attest to the transformative power of this facility. When I was a teenager, I had a child and was unsure of how to navigate my new role as a mother. I felt isolated and overwhelmed, with little support from my family or friends.
When I first arrived at Puaw?nanga, I was struck by the sense of community and belonging that pervaded the place. The staff was friendly and approachable, and the other residents were like-minded young women who shared my hopes and aspirations.
During my time at the facility, I learned how to take care of my child, manage my time, and set realistic goals for my future. I also gained valuable life skills, such as budgeting, cooking, and cleaning, which have served me well throughout my adult life.
