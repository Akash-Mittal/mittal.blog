  <p>Having a newborn can be both exciting and exhausting. Your little bundle of joy requires around-the-clock attention and care. To help make life with a newborn a little bit easier, here are 10 parenting hacks that you can use:</p>
  <h2>1. Use a baby wrap</h2><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/416778/pexels-photo-416778.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;dpr=2&amp;h=650&amp;w=940" alt="Baby wrap">
  <p>Baby wraps are a great way to keep your baby close and comforted while freeing up your hands to do other things. There are many different types of wraps available, so be sure to find one that is comfortable for you and your baby.</p>
  <h2>2. Try white noise</h2><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1122409/pexels-photo-1122409.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;dpr=2&amp;h=650&amp;w=940" alt="White noise">
  <p>White noise can help soothe your baby and help them fall asleep. There are many apps and machines available that can play white noise, or you can download a white noise track from the internet.</p>
  <h2>3. Use a diaper caddy</h2><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/325876/pexels-photo-325876.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;dpr=2&amp;h=650&amp;w=940" alt="Diaper caddy">
  <p>A diaper caddy is a portable and convenient way to keep all of your diaper-changing supplies in one place. You can easily carry it from room to room and always have everything you need close at hand.</p>
  <h2>4. Invest in a hands-free pumping bra</h2><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4495296/pexels-photo-4495296.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;dpr=2&amp;h=650&amp;w=940" alt="Hands-free pumping bra">
  <p>If you are planning on pumping breastmilk, a hands-free pumping bra is a must-have. It allows you to pump and multitask at the same time, which can be a huge time-saver.</p>
  <h2>5. Use a nursing pillow</h2><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/417749/pexels-photo-417749.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;dpr=2&amp;h=650&amp;w=940" alt="Nursing pillow">
  <p>A nursing pillow helps to support your baby in a comfortable position while breastfeeding. It can also reduce strain on your back and arms.</p>
  <h2>6. Get a baby swing</h2><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1769803/pexels-photo-1769803.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;dpr=2&amp;h=650&amp;w=940" alt="Baby swing">
  <p>A baby swing can be a lifesaver when you need to soothe a fussy or overtired baby. It can also give you a break when you need to take care of something else.</p>
  <h2>7. Use a baby carrier</h2><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1165727/pexels-photo-1165727.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;dpr=2&amp;h=650&amp;w=940" alt="Baby carrier">
  <p>Similar to a baby wrap, a baby carrier is a comfortable and convenient way to carry your baby with you while keeping your hands free.</p>
  <h2>8. Create a baby care station</h2><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/6493182/pexels-photo-6493182.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;dpr=2&amp;h=650&amp;w=940" alt="Baby care station">
  <p>A baby care station is a designated area where you keep all of your baby supplies organized and within easy reach. It can save you time and reduce stress when you need to quickly find something.</p>
  <h2>9. Use a baby monitor</h2><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/913979/pexels-photo-913979.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;dpr=2&amp;h=650&amp;w=940" alt="Baby monitor">
  <p>A baby monitor gives you peace of mind while your baby is sleeping or playing in another room. There are many different types of monitors available, including audio and video monitors.</p>
  <h2>10. Take care of yourself</h2><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4261425/pexels-photo-4261425.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;dpr=2&amp;h=650&amp;w=940" alt="Self-care">
  <p>Remember to take care of yourself during this busy time. Get plenty of rest, eat well, and ask for help when you need it. Taking care of yourself will help you take better care of your baby.</p>
