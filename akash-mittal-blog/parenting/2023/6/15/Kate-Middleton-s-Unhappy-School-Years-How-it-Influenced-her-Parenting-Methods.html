    <p>From the outside, Kate Middleton's life might look perfect. As a member of the Royal Family, she lives in a palace, wears designer clothes, and travels the world. But behind closed doors, Kate's childhood was far from idyllic. <strong>She was bullied in school, and those years of unhappiness have shaped the way she raises her own children.</strong></p>
    <p>As a child, Kate attended the exclusive Marlborough College in Wiltshire, where she struggled to fit in. Other students made fun of her accent and her family's middle-class background, and she reportedly spent a lot of time alone in her dorm room. Now, as a mother of three, Kate is determined to make sure her own children don't have the same experience.</p>
    
    <p>One of the ways Kate has been influenced by her school years is in how she talks to her children about their feelings. She has been vocal about her own struggles with anxiety and has encouraged her kids to be open and honest with her about how they're feeling. In an interview with <em>Garnett</em> magazine, she said, "It's important to talk openly about mental health, and the earlier we can start these conversations, the better."</p>
    <p>Another example of how Kate's school years have influenced her parenting is in the activities she chooses for her children. She's known for taking them on nature walks and playing with them in the garden, which could be seen as a reaction to the structured environment of Marlborough College. By encouraging her children to explore and play in a more natural setting, she's giving them the freedom to be themselves and enjoy childhood.</p>
