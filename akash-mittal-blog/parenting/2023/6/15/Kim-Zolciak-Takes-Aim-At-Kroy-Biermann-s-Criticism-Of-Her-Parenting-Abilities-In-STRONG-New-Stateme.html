   <p>Kim Zolciak, the star of reality TV show "Don't Be Tardy," has responded to her husband Kroy Biermann's recent criticisms of her parenting in a strong statement shared with her fans and followers on social media. According to Zolciak, Biermann had publicly called into question her ability to raise their six children during an argument, leading her to feel the need to defend herself.</p>
   <h2> the Situation</h2>
   <p>During the argument, which occurred off camera, Biermann reportedly accused Zolciak of being too lenient with their children's discipline, failing to enforce boundaries, and spending too much time on her phone instead of being a present parent.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>According to a survey conducted by Common Sense Media, a non-profit organization that aims to help parents navigate the digital world, 47% of adults believe they spend too much time on their phones in front of their children.</li>
    <li>In a study published in the journal Developmental Psychology, researchers found that children raised with overly strict discipline are more likely to develop behavioral problems such as aggression and defiance.</li>
    <li>A recent study by the American Academy of Pediatrics found that children of authoritative parents, who are both demanding and responsive, show better academic and emotional outcomes than those of authoritarian or permissive parents.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Kim Zolciak's Response</h2>
   <p>In her statement, Zolciak denied Biermann's accusations and defended her parenting style by saying that she is "a present mother, always taking care of everybody." She also stated that their parenting styles differ because of their differing childhoods - Zolciak grew up in a household with a single mother, while Biermann's parents were married.</p>
   <p>"Kroy and I do not have the same childhood background," Zolciak wrote. "I came from a single mother and strived to give my children a completely different life than I had. I always put my children and my family first, but that doesn't mean that I am not human, and that doesn't mean that I don't make mistakes."</p>
   <p>Zolciak acknowledged that she is not a perfect parent, but emphasized that she is always learning and growing as a mom. She encouraged her followers to "support and uplift each other" rather than tear each other down with judgment and criticism.</p>
   <h2>Practical Tips for Co-Parenting</h2>
   <p>The situation between Zolciak and Biermann highlights the importance of effective communication and co-parenting, especially in blended families. Here are some practical tips for navigating co-parenting relationships:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Communicate openly and respectfully with your co-parent, even in the midst of disagreement or conflict.</li>
    <li>Establish clear boundaries and expectations for discipline and behavior, and stick to them consistently.</li>
    <li>Recognize and respect your co-parent's differing parenting style and background, and find ways to work together and compromise when necessary.</li>
    <li>Focus on the well-being and happiness of your children, and prioritize their needs and interests over your own personal issues or conflicts.</li>
   </ul>
