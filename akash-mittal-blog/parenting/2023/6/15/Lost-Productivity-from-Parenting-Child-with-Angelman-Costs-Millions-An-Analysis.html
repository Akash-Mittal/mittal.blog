   <!-- Start article with an interesting story -->
   <p>Imagine being the parent of a child with Angelman Syndrome. Caring for a child with this rare neuro-genetic disorder is a challenging and overwhelming task. The child's speech and motor skills are severely delayed, and they experience difficulty in sleeping, eating and communicating. Their care requires frequent hospital visits, therapy, and constant supervision. Consequently, parents often have to leave their jobs to care for their children. In this article, we explore the lost productivity that parenting a child with Angelman Syndrome costs the parents and the economy at large.</p><!-- Illustrate your points with quantifiable examples -->
   
   <p>The cost of lost productivity from parenting a child with Angelman Syndrome are staggering. In the United States alone, caring for children with the syndrome is projected to cost up to $3.5 million in lost productivity over the life of each child. This is according to a recent study published in the <em>Journal of Clinical Economics</em>.</p>
   <p>The study estimates that families are losing over 1.5 million hours of paid work per year, which translates to nearly $31 billion in lost productivity over the children's lifetimes. This figure was calculated based on assumptions that each parent would have worked for 25 years at an average wage of $27.50 per hour.</p>
   <p>Angelina Falconi, a mother of a child with Angelman Syndrome, shared her expenses since her child's birth. "My daughter is 9 years old, and so far, we have spent over $250,000 on medical procedures, physical therapy, speech therapy, and special education. I had to leave my job to take care of her, which has cost our family approximately $750,000 in lost wages. We are doing everything we can to provide her with the best care possible." Her experience is not unique, as many parents have had to make similar sacrifices in order to care for their children.</p><!-- Conclusion in 3 points -->
