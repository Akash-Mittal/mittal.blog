   <p>Co-parenting can be challenging, but with the right attitude and mindset, it can also be a fulfilling experience. In a recent interview, Hollywood actresses Jennifer Garner and Sheryl Lee Ralph shared their thoughts and tips on healthy co-parenting.</p>
   <h2>An Example from Jennifer Garner</h2>
   <p>Jennifer Garner, who co-parents her three children with her ex-husband Ben Affleck, emphasizes the importance of putting the children's needs first. She says, "You have to be together for your kids and put them first, no matter what."</p>
   <p>A specific example she shared was about their youngest child's birthday party. Even though she and Affleck were separated at that time, they still organized a joint party to celebrate their child's special day. Garner says, "We all need to be able to say, 'I think we can do this together.' I think that's the best way, if you can manage it."</p>
   
   <p>Sheryl Lee Ralph, who co-parents her son with her ex-husband Eric Maurice, talks about the importance of consistency and communication in co-parenting. She says, "It's important to have the same rules in both households, so it's not confusing for the child."</p>
   <p>She also emphasizes the role of communication in co-parenting. Ralph says, "Communication is key. You have to make the phone calls, you have to make the effort."</p>
   <h2>Tips for Healthy Co-Parenting</h2>
   <p>Based on their experiences, Garner and Ralph offer the following tips for healthy co-parenting:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Put the children's needs first.</li>
    <li>Be consistent in parenting rules across households.</li>
    <li>Communicate regularly and effectively with your co-parent.</li>
   </ol>
   
   <p>Garner shares a personal anecdote about how she and Affleck worked together to help their son overcome his fear of swimming. She says, "We both had to get in the pool with him, because he was so scared. And I kept saying, 'Daddy is holding on to you, Daddy is holding on to you.' And then he held on to me."</p>
   <p>Ralph talks about how she and her ex-husband worked through their differences and focused on their son's well-being. She says, "We decided to be unified in our parenting, because we loved our child more than we hated each other."</p>
   <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
   <p>Garner suggests that co-parents should make an effort to attend their children's activities and events together. She says, "Your kids will appreciate that you stood next to each other for their soccer game or gymnastics meet or whatever it is. It's just worth it."</p>
   <p>Ralph advises co-parents to plan ahead and coordinate schedules to avoid conflicts. She says, "You have to plan ahead and know what each other's schedules are, so you're not leaving the child stranded. It's not about you, it's about the child."</p>
