   <p>It was a typical Saturday morning when I heard my daughter singing "Let it Go" from the movie Frozen. I chuckled to myself, thinking about how much Disney movies have impacted our lives. Little did I know, it wasn't just entertainment for us, but parenting advice as well.</p>
   
   <p>According to a survey conducted by BabyCenter, 84% of millennial parents reported that they have used Disney movies or characters to teach their children life lessons. In addition, 90% of those parents believe that Disney offers positive parenting values and 74% of parents think Disney is a trusted source of parenting advice.</p>
