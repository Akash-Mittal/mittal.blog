   <p>Kelly Clarkson, the Grammy-award winning singer and talk show host, recently opened up about her experiences as a parent on Glennon Doyle's podcast, "We Can Do Hard Things."</p>
   <p>Clarkson, who shares two children with her ex-husband Brandon Blackstock, spoke candidly about the challenges of co-parenting and balancing work and family life.</p>
   <h2> Kelly's Parenting Experiences</h2>
   <p>During the podcast, Clarkson shared several anecdotes that illustrate the ups and downs of parenting. One particularly challenging moment came when she was on tour and her daughter, River, who was just three years old at the time, was struggling with separation anxiety.</p>
   <p>Clarkson said that she was in the middle of a concert when she received a message from Blackstock that read, "You need to FaceTime her right now." When she did, she found River hysterical and inconsolable.</p>
   <p>"It was so hard because it was such a pivotal moment," Clarkson said. "I hadn't had a moment like that yet with my child, where they were that hysterical and that heartbroken. I didn't know what to do."</p>
   <p>Clarkson eventually got River to calm down and go to sleep, but the incident left a lasting impression.</p>
   <p>"I just remember thinking, 'I don't know how single parents do it,'" she said.</p>
   <p>In addition to the challenges of co-parenting, Clarkson also shared some of the joys of being a mom. One highlight was when her son, Remington, who was just two years old at the time, started singing along to her songs on the radio.</p>
   <p>"He'll be in his car seat in the back and he'll just scream, 'I love you!' It's the sweetest thing ever," she said.</p>
   <h2>Practical Tips for Parents from Kelly Clarkson</h2>
   <p>Throughout the podcast, Clarkson also offered some practical advice for parents who might be struggling with the same challenges she has faced.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>On co-parenting: "Just because somebody is your ex doesn't mean they're not a good parent."</li>
    <li>On balancing work and family life: "Be OK with carving out certain things for your children and carving out certain things for your job."</li>
    <li>On being a working mom: "It's important to know that it's OK to ask for help."</li>
   </ul>
