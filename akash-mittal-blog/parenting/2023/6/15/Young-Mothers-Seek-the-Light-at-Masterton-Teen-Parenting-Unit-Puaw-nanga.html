   <p>At twenty-one, Holly had a lot on her plate when she found out she was pregnant. She had always hoped to go to college and pursue her dream of becoming a nurse, but now it seemed like her plans were coming apart. Unsure of her choices, she started to feel like she was drowning in a sea of doubt and uncertainty.</p>
   <p>One day, she heard about the Puawānanga Teen Parenting Unit in Masterton, New Zealand, and decided to give it a try. From the moment she walked into the facility, she felt a sense of warmth and acceptance she had rarely experienced before. She was amazed by the nurturing and friendly environment, where young mothers like herself could come together and find support to overcome their struggles.</p>
