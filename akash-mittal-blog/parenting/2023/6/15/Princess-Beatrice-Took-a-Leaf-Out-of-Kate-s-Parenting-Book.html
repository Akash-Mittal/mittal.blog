   <p>Parenting is never an easy job, especially when you are a royalty. With the entire world watching your every move, being a parent can be challenging. However, Princess Beatrice had someone to look up to, her cousin-in-law, The Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton. When Kate became a mother in 2013, she changed the traditional royal parenting narrative with her hands-on approach. From natural birth to breastfeeding and from diaper duty to school drop-offs, Kate did it all herself. She showed everyone that being a royal doesn't mean you can't be a loving and involved parent.</p>
   <p>Princess Beatrice, who recently became a mother to a baby girl, has taken a leaf out of Kate's book when it comes to parenting. She is also following Kate's footsteps by introducing a more modern approach to parenting in the royal family.</p>
   
   <ul>
    <li>Princess Beatrice is following a modern approach to parenting by not hiring a nanny and being a hands-on mother.</li>
    <li>Following Kate's lead, Princess Beatrice also chose to have a natural birth at home.</li>
    <li>Princess Beatrice is planning to breastfeed her baby girl.</li>
    <li>Like Kate, Princess Beatrice will also take an active role in her child's education and upbringing.</li>

    <li><strong>Building a stronger family:</strong> When both parents take an active role in their child's life, it leads to stronger family bonds, better communication, and a more stable family environment.</li>
   </ol>
