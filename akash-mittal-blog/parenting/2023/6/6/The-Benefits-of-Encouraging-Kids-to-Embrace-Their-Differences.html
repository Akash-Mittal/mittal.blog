    <h2>Bullying Turned Into Friendship</h2>
    <p>Last year, my daughter came home from school and told me about a new girl in her class who was being bullied. She was different from the other kids and didn't quite fit in. However, my daughter decided to befriend her and soon they became inseparable. One day, I asked my daughter what made her want to be friends with this girl and she simply replied, "She's different, and I like that."</p>
    <p>This story is just one example of how encouraging kids to embrace their differences can lead to positive outcomes. As parents, we often want our children to fit in with the crowd and be accepted by their peers. However, when we encourage them to embrace their uniqueness, we allow them to be true to themselves and establish relationships based on mutual respect and acceptance.</p>
