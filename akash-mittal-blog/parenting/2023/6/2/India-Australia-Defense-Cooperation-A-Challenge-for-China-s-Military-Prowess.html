  <p>The world is moving towards multipolarity, and countries are coming together to deal with the challenges in this new world order. In Asia, India and Australia are emerging as key players, and their defense cooperation is becoming an important aspect of regional security. While this cooperation is aimed at promoting peace and stability in the region, it also poses a challenge for China's military prowess. This article examines the growing defense cooperation between India and Australia, and its implications for China's military strategy.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>An Interesting Story</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc across the world, China's aggressive maneuvers in the South China Sea raised concerns among its neighbors. In response, India and Australia stepped up their defense engagement, initiating the first-ever virtual summit between their leaders in June 2020. During the summit, the two countries signed a historic defense agreement that paved the way for closer cooperation in defense technology, maritime security, and military exercises. This marked a significant milestone in the bilateral relationship between the two countries, which had been steadily improving over the past few years. The defense agreement was a clear indication of India and Australia's commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific region, and their resolve to counter China's assertive behavior in the region.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable Examples</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>India and Australia have steadily increased their defense cooperation over the past few years. In 2014, the two countries signed a Framework for Security Cooperation, which laid the foundation for closer engagement in defense and security matters. Since then, they have signed several defense agreements, including a Mutual Logistics Support Agreement in 2020.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>India-Australia defense cooperation has also been visible in joint military exercises. Exercise Pitch Black, a biennial air combat exercise, has been conducted since 2006 between the two countries. In 2019, the first-ever naval exercise between India, Japan, and Australia was conducted in the Bay of Bengal. Similarly, in 2020, the Malabar naval exercise, which involved all four members of the Quad – India, Japan, Australia, and the US – was conducted in the Arabian Sea.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>India and Australia have also been cooperating in defense technology. In 2018, the two countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation in the field of defense research. The agreement aimed to promote cooperation in joint research and development projects in defense technology, as well as enhance the exchange of scientists and experts between the two countries.</p>

  <p>Conclusion in Three Points</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. India and Australia's defense cooperation is a significant challenge for China's military strategy.

  <p>Defense cooperation between India and Australia is not just a matter of military strategy, it is also rooted in shared values and people-to-people contacts. As an Indian living in Australia, I have witnessed the growing warmth and friendship between the two countries. The increasing number of Indian students and professionals in Australia is a testament to the deepening ties between the two countries. This people-to-people contact is essential for building trust and understanding, which are the bedrock of any successful relationship.</p>

  <p>Practical Tips</p>

  <p></p>
  <p>1. Establish more people-to-people contacts through exchange programs and joint research projects.</p>
