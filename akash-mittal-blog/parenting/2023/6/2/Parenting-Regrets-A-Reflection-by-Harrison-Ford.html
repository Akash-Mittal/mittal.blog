    <h2>The Heartbreaking Story</h2>
    <p>Harrison Ford, the legendary Hollywood actor, has been very honest about his parenting regrets in recent interviews. He revealed that he was so focused on his acting career that he missed out on many precious moments with his children. One particular incident that still haunts him happened when he was filming a movie in Europe.</p>
    <p>He was in a rush to finish the movie and return to America for another project. His son, who was just a toddler at the time, wanted nothing more than to spend time with his father. But Harrison was so preoccupied with work that he repeatedly brushed his son's requests aside and focused on his job. It was only after his son had cried himself to sleep that Harrison realized how much he had failed as a father.</p>
    <p>This incident and many others like it have inspired Harrison to speak out about the importance of balancing work and family. He wants to encourage other parents, especially those in demanding careers, to prioritize their family over their jobs.</p>

    <ul>
     <li>According to a study by the American Psychological Association, children who feel neglected by their parents are more likely to have behavioral problems, lower self-esteem, and struggle with attachment in their adult relationships.</li>
     <li>Another survey by CareerBuilder found that 1 in 4 working parents miss important events in their children's lives due to work obligations.</li>
     <li>Furthermore, a report by the National Academy of Sciences found that children of high-achieving parents, such as doctors and lawyers, are at higher risk of anxiety and depression due to their parents' demanding careers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These statistics highlight the need for parents to prioritize their children's well-being over their career success. It's important to remember that children need our time and attention more than anything else.</p>

     <li>Set aside dedicated family time each week. Whether it's a dinner together or a movie night, make sure your family knows that this time is non-negotiable.</li>
     <li>Be present when you're with your children. Put away your phone and other distractions, and give your children your undivided attention.</li>
     <li>Communicate with your employer and set boundaries. Let your employer know that your family comes first, and try to negotiate a more flexible schedule if possible.</li>
     <li>Take care of yourself. It's important to prioritize your own well-being too, so make sure you're getting enough rest and taking time for self-care.</li>
