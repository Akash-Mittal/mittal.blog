   <p>Nepal is seeking better terms for its Gurkha soldiers who serve in the Indian Army, the latest sign of strains between the two countries that share close ethnic and cultural ties.</p>
   <div>
    <h2>Background Story:</h2>
    <p>The Gurkhas are known for their loyalty and bravery, and have served in the British Army for over 200 years. Today, over 7,000 Gurkhas serve in the Indian Army, making up around 10% of its total strength.</p>
    <p>However, in recent years, Nepal has raised concerns over the working conditions and treatment of its soldiers in the Indian Army. Many Gurkhas are recruited at a young age and are often posted in remote areas, far from their families and communities.</p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <h2>Quantifiable Examples:</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>In July 2020, Nepal's Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the Indian Ambassador to Nepal to express its displeasure with the treatment of its Gurkha soldiers.</li>
     <li>According to a report by Human Rights Watch, many Gurkhas face discrimination and abuse in the Indian Army, including being subjected to "discriminatory restrictions on movement and access to social and medical services".</li>
     <li>There have been several instances of protests and strikes by Gurkhas in the Indian Army over the years, demanding better treatment and working conditions.</li>
    </ol>
   </div>
   <div>
    <h2>:</h2>
    <p>One Gurkha soldier, who asked to remain anonymous, told Bloomberg that he had been posted in a remote area near the border with Pakistan for over a year without any leave. He said that the living conditions were poor, with inadequate food and medical facilities.</p>
    <p>Another former Gurkha soldier, Birendra Bahadur Basnet, told the BBC that he had been dismissed from the Indian Army after he had contracted a medical condition but was denied treatment by his superiors.</p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>Nepal is seeking better terms for its Gurkha soldiers in the Indian Army, due to concerns over their treatment, working conditions and discriminatory practices against them.</li>
     <li>This issue is the latest sign of strains between the two countries, who share close ethnic and cultural ties but have had a strained relationship in recent years.</li>
     <li>The Indian Army needs to address the concerns of its Gurkha soldiers and ensure that they are treated fairly, with adequate living conditions and access to medical facilities.</li>
    </ol>
