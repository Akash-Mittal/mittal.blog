  <p>Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen have a lot on their plates as individuals, but together they make a power couple that constantly make headlines. Athlete and part-time actor, Brady, and supermodel and philanthropist, Bündchen, are both parents and have to navigate their busy schedules all while being present for their children.</p>
  <p>According to Page Six, the couple has come up with a plan to co-parent their three children, Vivian, Benjamin, and Jack. Jack is Brady's son with his ex-girlfriend, actress Bridget Moynahan. In the summer, the children will reportedly spend a lot of their time with their dad, so Bündchen can focus on her own work.</p>
  
  <p>Any parent knows that it's challenging to juggle parenting duties with work and daily life. Co-parenting requires cooperation and communication from both parents as they try to make the best choices for their children. In the case of Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen, they have a solid co-parenting partnership that allows them to prioritize their children and their work.</p>
  <p>One quantifiable example of their co-parenting plan is the division of labor in the summer. The children are said to spend "significant time" with Brady, which gives Bündchen the opportunity to work. This arrangement allows her to maintain a work-life balance and pursue her professional goals.</p>
  <p>Another example is how the couple spends quality time with their children. Brady and Bündchen both have busy schedules, but they make time for their family. Whether it's spending time at the beach or attending football games, the couple prioritizes their children and their needs, while still pursuing their own careers.</p>
