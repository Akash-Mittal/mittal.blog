  <h1>Labor urged to bring forward single parenting payment changes or have kids going hungry</h1> <img src="images/Labor-urged-to-bring-forward-single-parenting-payment-changes-or-have-kids-going-hungry.jpeg" alt="+Labor-urged-to-bring-forward-single-parenting-payment-changes-or-have-kids-going-hungry+">
  <p>It's a difficult time for many single parents, with the cost of living continuing to rise and many struggling to make ends meet. For those reliant on the single parenting payment, the situation is particularly dire.</p>
  <p>Recent research has found that many single parents are unable to afford basic necessities like food and housing, with some parents reporting having to skip meals to ensure their children are fed. This is a situation that is simply unacceptable in a wealthy country like Australia, and it's time for the government to take action.</p>
  <h2>Quantifiable examples</h2>
  <p>One recent survey found that 76% of single parents on the single parenting payment are skipping meals to ensure that their children have enough food. This is simply unacceptable and highlights the urgency of the situation.</p>
  <p>Another study found that more than 50% of single parents on the payment are unable to afford basic necessities like school uniforms and textbooks, which can have a significant impact on their children's education.</p>
  <h2>Why change is urgently needed</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>The current rate of the single parenting payment is simply not enough to cover the high cost of living, particularly in areas like housing and energy.</li>
   <li>Single parents and their children are being forced to live in poverty, which has significant long-term impacts on their health and wellbeing.</li>
   <li>Children should not have to go hungry or miss out on educational opportunities due to the financial struggles of their parents.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Personal anecdotes and case studies</h2>
  <p>One single mother of two young children, Jessica, shared her story with me about the struggles she faces on the single parenting payment:</p>
  <blockquote>
   "It's just really hard to make it work. I'm constantly juggling bills and trying to make sure my kids have enough to eat. There have been times where I've had to skip meals myself just to make sure they are fed. It's a really stressful way to live."
  </blockquote>
  <p>This is just one example of the real struggles faced by single parents on the single parenting payment.</p>
  <h2>What needs to be done</h2>
  <p>The government must take action to address the urgent situation faced by single parents on the single parenting payment. Some steps that could be taken include:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Increasing the rate of the single parenting payment to ensure that it covers the high cost of living.</li>
   <li>Providing greater support for single parents seeking employment, such as affordable childcare and flexible working arrangements.</li>
   <li>Providing greater support for single parents facing housing insecurity, such as affordable public housing options.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The current situation faced by single parents on the single parenting payment is simply unacceptable. Urgent action is needed to address this crisis, including increasing the rate of the payment and providing greater support for single parents facing financial struggles.</p>
  <p>It's time for the government to step up and ensure that no child in Australia goes hungry or misses out on educational opportunities due to the financial struggles of their parents.</p>
