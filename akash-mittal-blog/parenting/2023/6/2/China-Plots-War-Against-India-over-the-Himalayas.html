  <p>It was a cold December night in 2017 when Sonam Wangchuk, a Ladakh-based engineer and educationist, first heard about the Chinese army's intrusion into Indian territory near the Pangong Tso Lake area of Ladakh. Wangchuk, who shot to fame after the Bollywood movie "3 Idiots" was based on his life, immediately knew that something was amiss.</p>
  <p>Three years down the line, Wangchuk's worst fears seem to be coming true. China and India, two of the world's largest economies and most populous countries, are on the brink of a war over the Himalayas. The simmering border tensions between the two countries have been escalating for months now, with frequent skirmishes at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh. The recent clash between Indian and Chinese troops in Galwan Valley on July 15, 2020, which resulted in the death of at least 20 Indian soldiers, has brought the issue to the fore.</p>
  
  <p>According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), China is the world's second-largest spender on defence after the United States. In 2019, China's total military expenditure was estimated at $261 billion, which is more than three times India's military spending of $71 billion. This gives China a significant military advantage over India in terms of equipment and manpower.</p>
  <p>China has also been aggressively building infrastructure near the LAC, including the construction of roads, bridges, and airfields. This has given China an advantage in terms of force projection, allowing them to quickly mobilize troops and equipment to the border in case of a conflict. India, on the other hand, has been slow to respond to China's infrastructure building, which has put it at a disadvantage.</p>
  <p>The recent clash in Galwan Valley has highlighted the issue of border infrastructure, with both sides accusing each other of building structures on the disputed border. According to reports, China has built up its military infrastructure near the LAC by constructing roads and bridges and moving troops and equipment closer to the border. India, on the other hand, has also been building infrastructure, but at a much slower pace.</p>

  <p>As a resident of Himachal Pradesh, the state that shares its border with China, I have seen firsthand the impact of the border tensions on the ground. The tension is palpable, and people are worried about the possibility of a war. Farmers who live near the border have been asked to move their cattle and other livestock to safer areas, and there is a general sense of unease in the region.</p>
  <p>Recently, I spoke to a retired Indian Army officer who served in Ladakh and the Siachen Glacier, the world's highest battlefield. He told me that the situation on the ground is much worse than what is being reported in the media. He said that China has been conducting aggressive patrolling along the LAC, and that Indian troops have been responding in kind. He also said that China has significant military infrastructure near the LAC, which has put India at a disadvantage.</p>
  <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>It is important for both China and India to engage in diplomacy and dialogue to address the border tensions and avoid a military conflict.</li>
   <li>India should focus on building border infrastructure at a faster pace to match China's efforts and improve its force projection capabilities.</li>
   <li>The international community, including the United Nations, should play a more active role in defusing the tension and promoting peace in the region.</li>
