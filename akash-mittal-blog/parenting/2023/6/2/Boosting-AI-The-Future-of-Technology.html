   <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the backbone of modern technology. From chatbots to self-driving cars, AI has transformed the way we live, work and play. However, with the advancement of technology, it has become clear that AI needs a booster. This article explores some of the ways in which we can boost AI to enhance its capabilities and achieve even greater advancements in the field of technology.</p>
   
   <p>In the late 1990s, researchers at IBM developed Deep Blue, a chess-playing computer that defeated Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion. This was the first time a computer had beaten a human champion in a game of chess.</p>
   <p>Fast forward to 2016, AlphaGo, an AI program developed by Google, beat Lee Sedol, one of the world's best players of the board game Go. AlphaGo's victory marked a major milestone in the field of AI and spurred new research and development in the field.</p>
   
   <p>There are numerous examples of the impact of AI on various industries. For instance, in healthcare, AI-powered diagnostic tools can analyze patient data and offer more accurate diagnoses.
