  <p>One summer afternoon, as I looked outside my window, I saw a mother and her child crossing the street. The child, around 7 years old, was running ahead and the mother was struggling to keep up. As they reached the other end, the mother scolded her child for not holding her hand and putting them both in danger. The child replied, "But mom, I'm not a baby anymore." This incident made me think about how parenting styles have evolved over the years and how different they are from when I was young.</p>
  
  <p>According to a study published in the Journal of Marriage and Family, parents today are spending more time with their children than in the past. In 2012, 46% of fathers reported reading to their young children daily, compared to only 26% in 2003. Another study by the Pew Research Center found that today's parents are more likely to say their child is special and deserves special treatment than parents were in the past. In addition, today's parents are more likely to be concerned with their child's emotional well-being rather than just their physical safety.</p>

  <p>The evolution of parenting style: From overprotective to emotionally aware</p>
  <h2>Conclusion in Three Points</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>Parents today are spending more time with their children and are more emotionally aware of their needs.</li>
   <li>Parenting styles have shifted from being overprotective to allowing children to explore and make their own choices.</li>
   <li>With technology and globalization, parents are now facing new challenges in raising children that require them to adapt their parenting style accordingly.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>As a parent myself, I have noticed how much more aware I am of my child's emotions compared to how my parents were with me. My parents' parenting style was strict and authoritarian, while I try to be more democratic and listen to my child's opinions and feelings. For example, instead of punishing my child for misbehaving, I try to understand why they are acting out and find a solution that works for both of us. This approach has helped me establish an open and honest relationship with my child, allowing them to feel comfortable discussing any topic with me.</p>
