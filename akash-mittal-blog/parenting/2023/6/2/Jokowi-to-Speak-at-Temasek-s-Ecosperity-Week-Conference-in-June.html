     <h2>The Importance of Sustainability in Economic Development</h2>
     <p>Indonesian President Joko Widodo, commonly known as Jokowi, is set to deliver a keynote speech at Temasek's Ecosperity Week conference in June. The annual event, hosted by Singaporean investment company, Temasek, brings together leaders from business, government and civil society to discuss sustainable development and the challenges facing our planet.</p>
     <p>Jokowi's speech will focus on the importance of sustainability in economic development, something that is particularly relevant to his country. With a growing population of over 270 million people and an economy that is predicted to become the world's fourth largest by 2050, Indonesia is facing significant challenges when it comes to balancing economic growth with environmental protection.</p>

    <section id="examples">
     <h2> Successful Sustainable Development</h2>
     <p>The need for sustainable development is clear - without it, we risk damaging the planet irreparably for future generations. However, it's important to recognize that sustainable development doesn't have to come at the expense of economic growth. In fact, there are many examples of countries and businesses that have successfully combined the two.</p>
     <p>One country that stands out is Costa Rica. In the 1980s, Costa Rica faced significant environmental challenges, including deforestation and soil erosion. However, the country took action to protect its forests and in doing so, has transformed itself into one of the most sustainable countries in the world. Today, Costa Rica generates over 98% of its electricity from renewable sources and has established a number of protected areas that make up a quarter of its land.</p>
     <p>Another example is Unilever, the global consumer goods company. In 2010, Unilever launched its Sustainable Living Plan, which set out ambitious targets for reducing the company's environmental impact and improving its social performance. Since then, Unilever has achieved a number of significant milestones, including zero non-hazardous waste to landfill across its global factory network and sourcing 100% of its palm oil sustainably.</p>

     <h2> and Case Studies to Illustrate Points</h2>
     <p>While these examples show that sustainable development is possible, it's important to acknowledge that it can be challenging to achieve. That's why personal anecdotes and case studies can be so useful - they help to bring the theory of sustainable development to life.</p>
     <p>One example of this is the story of a small business in Indonesia that produces eco-friendly household cleaning products. The business owner, a young mother, was frustrated by the lack of environmentally-friendly options in her local supermarket and decided to take matters into her own hands. She started experimenting with making her own cleaning products and discovered that not only were they better for the environment, but they were also cheaper than the commercial products. She now runs a successful business that employs other women in her community and has a loyal customer base of people who value sustainable products.</p>
