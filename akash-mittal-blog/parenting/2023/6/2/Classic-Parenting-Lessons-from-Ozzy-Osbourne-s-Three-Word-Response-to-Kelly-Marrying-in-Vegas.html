   <p>When Kelly Osbourne announced that she had married her then-boyfriend in Las Vegas, her father Ozzy Osbourne responded with just three words: "Oh, for God's sake."</p>
   <p>While this may seem like a typical reaction from a disapproving parent, it actually contains a valuable lesson for all parents: sometimes, less is more.</p>
   <h2>The Power of Three Words</h2>
   <p>As parents, we often feel the need to lecture, scold, and guide our children at every turn. We want to make sure they make the right decisions, avoid mistakes, and become responsible adults.</p>
   <p>However, sometimes all it takes is a few carefully chosen words to convey our thoughts and feelings. In the case of Ozzy Osbourne, his response to his daughter's Vegas wedding was simple, direct, and conveyed a sense of disappointment without being overly critical or harsh.</p>
   <p>This approach is often more effective than a long-winded lecture or tirade, which can often cause children to tune out or become defensive.</p>
   
   <p>Here are some quantifiable examples of how using fewer words can be more effective:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>A study published in the Journal of Adolescence found that teens were more likely to comply with rules when they were given simple, clear directives rather than lengthy explanations.</li>
    <li>Research from Duke University found that children whose parents used harsh, critical language were more likely to have increased levels of inflammation in their bodies, which can lead to health problems later in life.</li>
    <li>A survey by the American Academy of Pediatrics found that parents who used positive reinforcement and praise, rather than punishment or criticism, had children who were more likely to develop healthy habits and positive self-esteem.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, the next time you find yourself wanting to launch into a long, drawn-out lecture with your child, consider the power of three words. Keep it simple, direct, and respectful, and you may find that your message is more effectively received.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Less is more when it comes to parenting.</li>
    <li>Simple, clear directives are often more effective than lengthy explanations.</li>
    <li>Positive reinforcement and praise can lead to healthy habits and positive self-esteem.</li>
   </ul>
