    <p>As a child, Juhi Parmar, like many others, was raised in a traditional household with strict parents who were always keen on instilling discipline and good morals in their children. However, as she grew older, Juhi realised that the way she was brought up was different from how children are raised today.</p>
    <p>She noticed that parents today are more open-minded and accepting of their children's individuality. They recognise that every child is unique and should be allowed to explore their passions and interests. Today's parents are more involved in their child's lives, catering to their emotional needs and providing a supportive environment.</p>

    <p>The evolution of parenting style can also be observed through the following quantifiable examples:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Breastfeeding rates have significantly increased over the years, with more mothers choosing to breastfeed their babies due to the numerous health benefits associated with it.</li>
     <li>The use of mobile devices has become prevalent, with many parents relying on them to keep their children entertained and engaged.</li>
     <li>The use of positive reinforcement has replaced strict discipline methods, promoting good behaviour through praise and rewards rather than punishment.</li>
     <li>The rise of co-parenting arrangements, where both parents share equal responsibility and involvement in raising their children.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
    <p>Juhi Parmar's personal experiences with parenting have taught her how to adapt to changes in the environment. She believes that today's children are exposed to a wide range of influences, including social media, which weren't prevalent during her upbringing. To navigate this complex landscape, parents must engage with their children and create a supportive environment that encourages open communication and trust.</p>
    <p>Case studies have shown that children who receive a nurturing and supportive upbringing tend to thrive academically, socially and emotionally. For instance, a study conducted by Harvard University revealed that children who receive positive and affirming parenting are more likely to succeed in school and have better mental health outcomes.</p>

    <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
    <p>Based on her insights, Juhi Parmar has outlined some practical tips to help parents navigate the evolving parenting landscape:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Engage with your child - Take an active interest in your child's life, show genuine concern and create a supportive environment that encourages open communication.</li>

     <li>Co-parenting - Share equal responsibility and involvement in raising your child, and make decisions together for the well-being of your child.</li>
