  <p></p>
  <p>Kim Zolciak Biermann, the star of "Real Housewives of Atlanta" and "Don't Be Tardy," has completed a parenting course amid her divorce from husband Kroy Biermann. The course was designed to help parents navigate through the difficulties of divorce and co-parenting.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Kim has always been vocal about her love for her children and her dedication to being a good parent, but going through a divorce with young children can be especially challenging. In order to ensure that her children continue to receive the best care possible during this difficult time, Kim has taken the proactive step of completing a parenting course.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The course has helped Kim to develop strategies for effective communication with her ex-husband Kroy, as well as ways to minimize the stress and confusion that can come with a divorce. Kim has also learned how to maintain a consistent and positive co-parenting relationship with Kroy, which will ultimately benefit their children.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Kim's decision to take a parenting course is just one example of how parents can take proactive steps to ensure the well-being of their children during a divorce. Here are some additional strategies that can help parents to create a positive co-parenting relationship:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Put Your Children First</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>During a divorce, it can be easy to get caught up in the emotions and logistics of the legal process. However, it's important to remember that your children are the ones who will be most affected by the divorce. As much as possible, try to keep them at the forefront of your decisions and communicate with them in an age-appropriate way.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Create a Consistent Routine</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Divorce can be a disruptive time for children, but having a consistent routine can help to provide a sense of stability and security. Work with your ex-spouse to create a co-parenting schedule that works for everyone, and stick to it as much as possible.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Focus on Positive Communication</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Effective communication is key to a successful co-parenting relationship. Try to avoid negative or confrontational interactions with your ex-spouse, and instead focus on communicating in a positive and respectful way.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>By following these strategies and taking proactive steps to protect the best interests of their children, parents can help to minimize the impact of divorce on their family. Kim Zolciak Biermann's completion of a parenting course is a great example of how parents can take an active role in promoting co-parenting success.</p>
