   <p>Being a parent is hard. Being a good parent is even harder. We all want the best for our children, but figuring out what that is and how to achieve it can leave us feeling overwhelmed and unsure. That's where parenting experts like Dr. Justin Coulson come in.</p>
   <p>Dr. Coulson is a renowned parenting expert and researcher, and the author of several books on parenting. He's also the host of the hit podcast <em>Parental as Anything</em>, and a regular commentator on parenting issues in the media.</p>
   <p>As we gear up for another season of <em>Parental as Anything</em>, let's take a closer look at some of Dr. Coulson's takes on common parenting dilemmas.</p>
   <h2>Screen Time</h2>
   <p>One of the hottest topics in modern parenting is screen time. How much is too much? What effect is it having on our kids' development? Dr. Coulson's take on screen time is nuanced. He acknowledges the risks and drawbacks of excessive screen time, but also emphasizes the potential benefits.</p>
   <p>For example, Dr. Coulson points out that screen time can provide opportunities for learning, creativity, and social connection. He also notes that screen time can be a valuable way for parents and children to bond and share experiences.</p>
   <p>However, Dr. Coulson is also clear that screen time needs to be balanced with other activities, and that parents need to be mindful of the content their children are consuming. He recommends that parents set limits on screen time, and encourage their children to engage in other activities like reading, playing outside, and spending time with friends.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Quantifiable example: According to a 2019 report from the American Academy of Pediatrics, toddlers between 18 and 24 months old should have no screen time except for video chatting with family members. For children between 2 and 5, screen time should be limited to one hour per day of high-quality content.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Praising Effort vs. Praising Achievement</h2>
   <p>Another parenting dilemma that Dr. Coulson has weighed in on is the question of how to praise our children. Should we focus on praising their achievements, or should we focus on praising their effort?</p>
   <p>Dr. Coulson's perspective is aligned with the latter. He argues that praising effort helps children develop a growth mindset, which is essential for long-term success and happiness. When we praise a child's effort, we reinforce the idea that their abilities are not fixed, but can be improved with hard work and persistence.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, praising achievement can lead children to develop a fixed mindset, where they believe their abilities are predetermined and immutable. This can be detrimental to their motivation and performance in the long run.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Quantifiable example: In a study published in the journal <em>Child Development</em>, researchers found that children who were praised for their effort showed more perseverance and better academic performance than children who were praised for their intelligence.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>The Power of Listening</h2>
   <p>Another theme that Dr. Coulson often emphasizes in his work is the importance of listening to our children. Listening is a crucial component of effective communication and building strong relationships with our children.</p>
   <p>Dr. Coulson recommends that parents make a conscious effort to really listen to their children, without interrupting or dismissing their thoughts and feelings. He also emphasizes the importance of validating our children's emotions, even if we don't always agree with them.</p>
   <p>By listening actively and empathetically to our children, we can help them develop a strong sense of self-worth, resilience, and emotional intelligence.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Personal anecdote: When my daughter was upset after a disagreement with a friend, I took the time to really listen to her and validate her feelings. Even though I didn't necessarily agree with her perspective, I was able to help her work through her emotions and come up with a solution that felt good to her. This strengthened our bond and helped build her confidence in navigating social relationships.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>Parenting is full of dilemmas and challenges, but by taking a page from experts like Dr. Justin Coulson, we can navigate them with more confidence and success. Here are three key takeaways from Dr. Coulson's approach:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Balance screen time with other activities, and be mindful of the content your children are consuming.</li>
    <li>Praise effort rather than achievement, to help children develop a growth mindset and motivation for long-term success.</li>
    <li>Listen actively and empathetically to your children, to build strong relationships and emotional intelligence.</li>
   </ol>
   <p>By keeping these principles in mind, we can be the best possible parents to our children, and help them grow into happy, healthy, and successful adults.</p>
