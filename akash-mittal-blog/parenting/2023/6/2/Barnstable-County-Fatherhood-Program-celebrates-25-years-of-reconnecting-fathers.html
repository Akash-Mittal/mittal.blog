  <p>When Mark became a father at age 27, he was lost. He had grown up without a father figure and had no idea how to be a good dad. His own dad had left when he was just a baby, and his mom had struggled to raise him and his siblings on her own. Mark never knew how much he needed a father figure until he became one himself.</p>
  <p>So, he turned to the Barnstable County Fatherhood Program for help. It was there that he found a supportive community of other fathers who were going through the same struggles as he was.</p>
  <p>Mark is just one of the many fathers who have been helped by the Barnstable County Fatherhood Program over the past 25 years. Founded in 1996, the program has been dedicated to connecting fathers with their children and improving the lives of families throughout Barnstable County.</p>
  <h2> the Program's Success</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>Over the past 25 years, the program has helped over 1,000 fathers reconnect with their children</li>
   <li>84% of fathers who complete the program continue to be involved in their children's lives</li>
   <li>Children of fathers who complete the program have higher graduation rates and are less likely to get involved in crime</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The program's success is due in part to its comprehensive approach. Fathers who enroll in the program participate in parenting classes, career counseling, and one-on-one mentoring. They also have access to legal support, housing assistance, and other resources to help them become better fathers and providers for their families.</p>
  <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
  <p>One father who was helped by the program is James, who had been in and out of prison for most of his adult life. When he became a father, he knew he wanted to break the cycle of incarceration in his family and be a better role model for his children. Through the Barnstable County Fatherhood Program, James was able to find steady employment and learn parenting skills that he never had before. He now has custody of his children and is working to give them a better future.</p>
  <p>Another father, Carlos, had been estranged from his son for years. He had struggled with addiction and had lost custody of his son to his ex-wife. Through the Barnstable County Fatherhood Program, he was able to get clean and sober and build a relationship with his son. He now sees his son regularly and is grateful for the second chance that the program gave him.</p>
