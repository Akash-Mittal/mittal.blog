    <p>It was a beautiful summer evening and Harrison Ford had just finished filming the latest <em>Indiana Jones</em> movie. He had spent the past few months away from his family, working long hours on set. As he walked out of the studio, he saw his wife and children waiting for him. His heart sank as he realized that he had missed another important moment in their lives.</p>
    <p>That night, as he sat down to dinner with his family, he couldn't help but feel a sense of regret. He had been so focused on his acting career that he had missed out on precious time with his children. He realized that he needed to make a change before it was too late.</p>
