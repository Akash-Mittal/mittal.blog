   <p>Indonesian President Joko Widodo, also known as Jokowi, is set to speak at Temasek's Ecosperity Week conference in Singapore this June. The conference is an annual event that focuses on sustainable development, showcasing innovative solutions to environmental challenges and promoting international collaboration.</p>
   <p>Jokowi's participation in the conference highlights the important role that Indonesia plays in the region's efforts towards sustainability and conservation. As one of the largest economies in Southeast Asia and home to the world's third-largest tropical rainforest, Indonesia has a critical responsibility in addressing climate change and protecting biodiversity.</p>
   <p>During his speech, Jokowi is expected to discuss Indonesia's progress in achieving its commitments under the Paris Agreement, as well as its plans for sustainable development in various sectors such as agriculture, forestry, and energy. He will also likely address Indonesia's efforts in reducing plastic waste, which has become a pressing issue in the country.</p>
   <h2> Indonesia's Sustainability Efforts</h2>
   <h3>1. Forest Conservation</h3>
   <p>Indonesia has made significant efforts in conserving its tropical rainforests, which are important in preserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change. According to a report by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Indonesia had one of the highest rates of annual forest loss in the early 2000s, but this has significantly decreased in recent years. In fact, Indonesia has reduced its deforestation rate by over 60% since 2015, thanks to policies such as a moratorium on new logging and a peatland restoration program.</p>
   <h3>2. Renewable Energy</h3>
   <p>Indonesia has also made strides in promoting renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power. In 2019, the country launched Southeast Asia's largest floating solar power plant, which can generate enough electricity to power over 2,000 households. The government has also set a target of increasing the share of renewable energy in the country's energy mix to 23% by 2025, up from about 10% in 2019.</p>
   <h3>3. Plastic Waste Reduction</h3>
   <p>Indonesia is the world's second-largest plastic polluter after China, with over 10 million tons of plastic waste produced annually. However, the government has taken steps to address this issue, including a ban on single-use plastic bags in major cities and a pledge to reduce overall plastic waste by 70% by 2025. The private sector has also been proactive in addressing plastic waste, with companies such as Unilever and Coca-Cola setting targets for using recycled plastic in their products.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Jokowi's participation in Temasek's Ecosperity Week conference highlights Indonesia's commitment to sustainability and its role in promoting regional cooperation towards achieving common goals.</li>
    <li>Indonesia has made significant progress in various sectors such as forest conservation, renewable energy, and plastic waste reduction, but more needs to be done to ensure sustainable development for future generations.</li>
    <li>Policymakers, private sector leaders, and individuals can all contribute to sustainability efforts by making conscious choices and taking actions that reduce our impact on the environment.</li>
