    <h2>Not So Picture Perfect</h2>
    <p>I don't know about you, but before I had my first child, my Instagram feed was full of beautiful, polished photos of couples smiling adoringly at their newborns, minimalist nurseries, and effortlessly stylish parents. It looked like a fairy tale.</p>
    <p>But as soon as I became a parent, I realized that reality was very different. Spit-up, sleepless nights, and endless tantrums were just a few of the challenges that came with raising a tiny human. And yet, despite it all, parenting is also one of the most rewarding experiences in the world.</p>
    <h2>Laughing Through the Journey</h2>
    <p>Twitter has become a hub for parents to share their hilarious anecdotes, embarrassing moments, and heartwarming stories. And while parenting can be tough, these tweets remind us that laughter is often the best medicine. Here are 25 tweets that sum up the delightful journey of parenting:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>"My son got mad at me yesterday and opened all the bananas in the house. What type of passive-aggressive monster..." -@alyssalimp</li>
     <li>"If I had a dollar for every time my kid interrupted me, I could actually afford to give them the childhood I always dreamed of." -@sarcasticmommy4</li>
     <li>"Welcome to parenthood. You're always tired but never get to sleep, you're always hungry but never get to eat, and your child is always sick but never gets a fever at the doctor's office." -@emmaladyrose</li>
     <li>"I told my son he couldn't play video games until he finished his homework and he said, 'Challenge accepted.' He's getting a Ph.D." -@eve_vs_evil</li>
     <li>"Before kids: I'm never letting them watch TV. After kids: What's a good age to start a Netflix binge?" -@WalkingOutside</li>
    </ul>
