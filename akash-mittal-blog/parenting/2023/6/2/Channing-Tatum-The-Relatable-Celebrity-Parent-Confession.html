  <p></p>
  <p>Parenting is hard, there's no denying that. Whether you're a celebrity or not, raising tiny humans comes with its fair share of struggles and challenges. However, when a celebrity opens up about their own parenting mishaps, it makes them all the more relatable. This is exactly what happened when Channing Tatum made a recent confession about his parenting skills.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>During an interview with People, Tatum discussed his experience with home-schooling amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. He admitted that, despite his best efforts, he wasn't exactly a natural teacher. In fact, he shared a hilariously relatable story about his son's math homework.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>"We had to do some geometry homework the other day, and I'm like, okay, yeah, let's do it," Tatum said. "I'm on the computer, and I'm learning fifth-grade math. I'm getting taught by like a 10-year-old. And when I answered the questions, I felt very confident in my answers, but he's like, 'Dad, let me tell you how you're actually supposed to do it.'"</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This story is a perfect example of the struggles parents face when trying to help their children with schoolwork. Even celebrities like Channing Tatum aren't exempt from the difficulties of home-schooling. It goes to show that, no matter who you are, parenting is a learning experience from start to finish.</p>

  <p> Relatable Parenting Struggles</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Channing Tatum's confession is just one relatable example of how parents can struggle with everyday parenting tasks. Here are a few more quantifiable examples:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>- Sleep deprivation: According to a study by the National Sleep Foundation, parents lose an average of 44 days of sleep within their child's first year of life.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>- Picky eaters: A study by WebMD found that almost 50% of parents struggle with getting their children to eat a balanced diet.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>- Technology usage: Common Sense Media found that 98% of households with children under the age of eight have at least one mobile device, posing challenges for parents trying to monitor their children's usage.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>These examples showcase just a few of the difficulties parents face on a daily basis. However, it's important to remember that every family is different and every child is unique. What works for one family may not work for another, so it's important to find what works best for you.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion: The Three R's of Relatable Parenting</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Realistic Expectations: It's important to remember that parenting is not always going to be perfect. It's okay to make mistakes and learn as you go.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Resilience: Be prepared to face challenges and work through them. Remember, you're not alone in this parenting journey.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Resourcefulness: There are so many resources available to parents today, from parenting blogs to online communities. Utilize these resources to help you navigate the ups and downs of parenting.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, Channing Tatum's parenting confession highlights the relatable nature of the challenges parents face. Sleep deprivation, picky eaters, and technology usage are just a few of the difficulties parents can encounter. However, with realistic expectations, resilience, and resourcefulness, parents can work through the challenges and become the best caregivers they can be.</p>
