   <p>As I was watching Yeh Meri Family on Amazon miniTV, I couldn't help but reminisce about my childhood. Back then, parenting was much different than it is today. Our parents had a strict approach toward us, which was often a combination of love and discipline. However, parenting styles have changed over the years, and now we find ourselves with a more flexible and child-centric approach. With Juhi Parmar's insights in Yeh Meri Family, let's take a look at how parenting has evolved and its consequences.</p>
   <h2>Quantifiable examples of how parenting styles have evolved</h2>
   <p>The change in parenting styles can be attributed to various reasons such as a shift in societal values, increased access to information and technology, and changes in the workforce. Here are some quantifiable examples of how parenting styles have changed over the years:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The rise of attachment parenting, which emphasizes the importance of the bond between parent and child and focuses on meeting a child's emotional and physical needs.</li>
    <li>Decrease in spanking and physical discipline, and an increase in positive reinforcement methods of discipline such as time-outs, loss of privileges or rewards.</li>
    <li>The increased availability of resources such as parenting classes, online support groups, and parenting blogs have made it easier for parents to access information about modern parenting techniques.</li>
    <li>Cultural values have changed, and with that, our perception of childhood has changed too. Children are given more freedom and respect than ever before as we acknowledge children have the right to their own viewpoints and desires.</li>
    <li>Parents are placing a higher value on work-life balance, which has resulted in more flexible working hours and work from home options.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>The Consequences of the Changing Parenting Styles</h2>
   <p>While the evolution of parenting styles has been a positive change in many ways, some consequences must be acknowledged. Here are a few examples:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Increased anxiety among parents</li>
    <li>Increased independence of children</li>
    <li>Decreased connection between parents and children</li>
    <li>Lack of discipline</li>
    <li>Entitled attitude among children</li>
    <li>Less emphasis on traditions</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>Conclusion in Three Points</h2>
   <p>The evolution of parenting styles has undoubtedly had many positive outcomes. However, it is essential to acknowledge the consequences that come along with the changing landscape of parenting:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Parents need to be mindful of balancing love and discipline when raising a child to ensure they grow up with respect and kindness towards others.</li>
    <li>Parents should manage their anxiety levels and focus on building a trusting and open relationship with their children.</li>
    <li>Parents should also focus on a work-life balance and setting boundaries to help nurture a healthy relationship with their children.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2> and Practical Tips</h2>
   <p>As a new parent myself, I have learned a lot from Juhi Parmar's Yeh Meri Family, which has provided me with an insight into the changing landscape of parenting. Here are some practical tips, I believe, can be beneficial in more ways one:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Connect with other parents for support, who are going through the same things as you are going through</li>
    <li>Consider implementing a hybrid approach to parenting, which balances structure and flexibility, love and discipline, etc.</li>
    <li>Recognize and work through any anxiety you may have surrounding parenting by talking to your partner, trusted family members, or mental health professionals.</li>
    <li>Develop a routine that works for you and your child</li>
    <li>Find time for self-care, like enjoying a walk or going to a yoga class for a few minutes every day after work or nap time.</li>
   </ul>
