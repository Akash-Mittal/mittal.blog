  <p>It wasn't a typical Sunday afternoon for Jennifer Garner and Sheryl Lee Ralph. The two actresses came together to discuss a topic that's all too common in Hollywood and in households worldwide - divorce. Both women have been through the wringer when it comes to relationships, but they've done something that not many can say they have. They've navigated the choppy waters of divorce with a sense of civility and maturity for the greater good of their children.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>A few years ago, Jennifer's divorce from Ben Affleck was a topic of conversation everywhere. The tabloids couldn't get enough of the scandalous details, and the public was left with a sense of pity for the actress who had to endure such a public humiliation. The marriage had crumbled, but Jennifer was determined to keep her children's best interests in mind.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Sheryl Lee Ralph hadn't had it any easier in her own divorce. Her husband of 20 years left her for a man, and she was left to pick up the pieces. Even with that kind of dramatic infidelity, she's taken a high road in raising her children and dealing with her ex.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Both women agreed that divorce is ugly. It's not pleasant, and it can be an emotional rollercoaster. But they emphasized that it's important to stay level-headed and mature when dealing with an ex-partner for the well-being of the children.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Jennifer cited a moment in her life when she knew things needed to change for the sake of her children. She and her ex-husband were supposed to spend Christmas at a rented house in Montana with their children. Things got heated between the two, and Jennifer opted to leave the house and take their kids with her. It was a moment of clarity for her, and she realized that if she ever wanted to create a healthy dynamic for her children, she needed to make a change.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Sheryl agreed that children always come first in every decision that's made. She shared an anecdote about how she and her ex-husband only fought behind closed doors. Her children never heard them argue, and they never spoke ill of their father. It was a decision they made early on in their divorce, and it's paid off.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>So, how can you create a healthy co-parenting dynamic with your ex? Here are a few tips from two wise women who've been through it themselves:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Put your children first. Always.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Communicate in a respectful and cordial manner. You don't have to be best friends, but you should be able to communicate about your children without hostility.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Keep your negative feelings towards your ex to yourself. Children don't need to hear it, and it only makes co-parenting even harder.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Divorce may be ugly, but it doesn't have to be damaging. Jennifer Garner and Sheryl Lee Ralph are examples of what can happen when you put your children first and maintain civility with your ex. It's not always easy, but in the end, your children will thank you for it.</p>
