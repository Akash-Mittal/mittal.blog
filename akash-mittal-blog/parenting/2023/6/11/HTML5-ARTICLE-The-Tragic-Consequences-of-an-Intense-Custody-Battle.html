  <p></p>
  <p>It was a typical Monday morning when Julie Larson received a call from her best friend, Sarah Bliefnick. But instead of the usual chit-chat about their weekend plans, Sarah's voice was shaking and she was crying uncontrollably. Julie tried to calm her down and finally, Sarah managed to say, "He did it. Tim killed our kids." Julie couldn't believe what she was hearing. She knew about the intense custody battle that Sarah and Tim had been going through, but she never imagined that it would end in such a horrific way.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. Custody battles are a reality for many separated or divorced couples. And all too often, they can become intense and even violent. Court documents in the Bliefnick divorce case reveal just how bitter and contentious the proceedings were before the tragic murder of Sarah and Tim's children.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In one filing, Sarah accused Tim of physical and emotional abuse towards both her and their children. She claimed he had a history of anger management issues and had been convicted of battery in the past. In response, Tim accused Sarah of neglecting the children and having an extramarital affair. He demanded full custody of their three children, citing his stable job and income as reasons why he would be the better parent.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The custody battle dragged on for months, with both sides hurling accusations at each other and presenting evidence to support their claims. The children were caught in the middle, with each parent accusing the other of using them as pawns in the legal battle.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Unfortunately, this is not an uncommon situation. According to statistics from the American Psychological Association, custody battles can have serious consequences for both children and parents. Children caught in the middle of custody battles are at risk of depression, anxiety, and even suicide. Parents may experience physical and emotional stress, financial strain, and damage to their mental health.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>It's important to remember that custody battles aren't just about winning. They're about finding the best solution for the children involved. Here are three key takeaways for those going through a custody battle:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Focus on the children</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Custody battles can be extremely emotionally charged, but it's crucial for parents to remember that their children are the primary focus. Children should never be used as bargaining chips or weapons in a legal battle. Instead, parents should work towards a solution that benefits the children's long-term wellbeing and happiness.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Consider mediation</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Mediation can be a much less adversarial option than going to court. It allows parents to work together to create a parenting plan that meets the needs of their particular family. It also gives children a sense of control over their own lives and relieves some of the pressure that can be placed on them during a custody battle.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Seek professional help</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Custody battles can be overwhelming and emotionally exhausting. It's important to seek professional help, such as therapy or counseling, to manage the stress and anxiety that can come with this kind of legal battle. This can also be beneficial for children, as they may need extra support during this difficult time.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, custody battles can have tragic consequences. It's important for parents going through a separation or divorce to prioritize their children's long-term wellbeing and happiness. Seeking mediation and professional help can make the process less adversarial and stressful. Custody battles should never be taken lightly, and every effort should be made to resolve conflicts peacefully and in the best interest of the children involved.</p>
