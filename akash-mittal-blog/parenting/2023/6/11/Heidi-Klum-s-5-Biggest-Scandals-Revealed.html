    <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
    <p>One of the most high-profile scandals involving Heidi Klum was her divorce from Seal in 2012. The couple had been married for seven years and had four children together. When they announced their separation, many fans were shocked and saddened by the news. However, things quickly turned ugly when Seal accused Heidi of cheating on him with her bodyguard, Martin Kirsten. Heidi denied the allegations and insisted that she had always been faithful to Seal. Despite the drama, the couple eventually reached a settlement and moved on with their lives.</p>
    <p>Another scandal that Heidi faced was criticism over her parenting skills. In 2020, her ex-husband Seal spoke out against her, saying that she puts her work before her children. Heidi has always been very career-driven and has had a successful modeling career for many years. However, she has also been very involved in her children's lives and has often brought them along with her on her travels and appearances. While some have criticized her for not being a more hands-on parent, Heidi has defended herself, saying that she tries to balance her work and family life as best she can.</p>
