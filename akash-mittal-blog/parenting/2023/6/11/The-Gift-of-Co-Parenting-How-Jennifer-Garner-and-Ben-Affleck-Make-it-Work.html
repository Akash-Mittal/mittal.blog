  <p>With the divorce rate hovering around 39% in the United States, co-parenting can be a daunting task for many parents. But for Hollywood stars Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck, co-parenting has become a gift.</p>
  <p>In an interview with Variety's Actors on Actors series, Garner spoke candidly about the ups and downs of co-parenting with her ex-husband, affirming that they have a "healthy" relationship for the sake of their three children.</p>
  <p>"It's not Ben's job to make me happy, it's not my job to make Ben happy. We are responsible for our own happiness," Garner said. "But Ben has certainly been the most important relationship of my adult life, and one of the most important people who helped me get to that place of self-realization."</p>
  <p>Garner's positive outlook on co-parenting may seem unrealistic to some, but it's not impossible. Here are three practical tips for making co-parenting work:</p>
  <h2>1. Prioritize Communication</h2>
  <p>Garner and Affleck's successful co-parenting relationship is largely due to their willingness to communicate. In fact, they still attend therapy sessions together to improve their communication skills.</p>
  <p>"If you love your kids and you love each other, you do whatever it takes," Garner said.</p>
  <p>According to a study by the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, communication is the leading cause of divorce. By prioritizing open and honest communication with your ex-partner, you can establish trust and mutual respect, which are essential components of successful co-parenting.</p>
  <h2>2. Focus on the Children</h2>
  <p>Despite their past differences, Garner and Affleck put their children first when it comes to co-parenting. They maintain a consistent schedule for their children, attend their school events together, and make sure their kids feel loved and supported by both parents.</p>
  <p>"We are a family," Garner said. "We will always be a family and we will always prioritize our children."</p>
  <p>By focusing on the needs and well-being of your children, you can build a strong and healthy co-parenting relationship with your ex-partner. It's important to remember that your children's feelings and needs should come before any personal conflicts you may have with your ex.</p>
  <h2>3. Be Flexible and Adaptable</h2>
  <p>Co-parenting can be challenging, especially when it comes to scheduling and logistics. But by being flexible and adaptable, you can make it work.</p>
  <p>For example, if one parent has to work late, the other parent can step in and take care of the children. Or if there's a scheduling conflict, both parents can work together to find a solution that works for everyone.</p>
  <p>According to a survey by the National Parents Organization, 70% of co-parents report having a positive co-parenting relationship. Being flexible and adaptable can help you achieve that positive relationship with your ex-partner.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Co-parenting can seem overwhelming, but it doesn't have to be. By prioritizing communication, focusing on the needs of your children, and being flexible and adaptable, you can build a successful co-parenting relationship with your ex-partner.</p>
  <p>As Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck have shown, co-parenting can be a gift. By working together as a team, you can create a stable and loving environment for your children, even after the end of your romantic relationship.</p>
