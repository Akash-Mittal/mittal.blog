  <p>When it comes to athletic genes, it seems that Brittany Mahomes, the wife of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, has passed them on to their daughter Sterling. The couple recently shared some rare photos of the 2-year-old playing soccer, and it's clear that Sterling has inherited her mother's talent and love for the sport.</p>
  <p>Brittany played soccer at the NCAA Division II level and was a standout forward for the University of Texas at Tyler. She continued to play the sport after college and even coached a youth team. It's no surprise, then, that Sterling is already showing promise on the soccer field.</p><img src="https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Brittany_Mahomes_daughter_sterling_soccer.jpg" alt="Brittany Mahomes' daughter Sterling playing soccer" width="800" height="534">
  <p>In the photos shared by the Mahomes family, Sterling can be seen dribbling the ball, kicking it toward the goal, and even executing a fancy move known as a stepover. She looks completely at ease on the field and seems to be having a blast playing with her older brother, 3-year-old Patrick Mahomes II.</p>
  <p>Of course, at 2 years old, Sterling is still very young, and it's too soon to tell if she will follow in her mother's footsteps and become a serious soccer player. But the photos are still a testament to the importance of parents sharing their interests and passions with their children, even at a young age.</p>
  
  <p>Research has shown that children who participate in sports are more likely to experience academic success, develop self-esteem, and form positive relationships with adults and peers. According to <a href="https://www.nays.org/sklive/for-parents/positive-results-of-being-a-sport-parent/" target="_blank">the National Alliance for Youth Sports</a>, children who play sports:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Score higher on tests and have better school attendance</li>
   <li>Are less likely to smoke, use drugs or engage in other high-risk behaviors</li>
   <li>Have higher levels of self-esteem and self-confidence</li>
   <li>Are more likely to develop leadership skills and teamwork abilities</li>
  </ul>
  <p>While it's important for children to be exposed to a variety of interests and activities, the benefits of sports participation are hard to ignore. And in the case of Sterling Mahomes, it seems that her mother's passion for soccer is already rubbing off on her.</p>
