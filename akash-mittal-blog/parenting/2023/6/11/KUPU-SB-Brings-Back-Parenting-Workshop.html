    <p>As a mother of two, I always try my best to be a good parent and raise my children right. But sometimes, I feel like I am not doing enough or I am not doing it right. That's why I was so excited to hear that KUPU SB is bringing back their Parenting Workshop. I attended their workshop last year and it was such a great experience that I decided to join again this year.</p>
    <p>KUPU SB's Parenting Workshop is a two-day event that covers topics such as communication, discipline, and child development. The workshop is led by experienced and knowledgeable speakers who provide practical tips and advice for parents. The best part of the workshop is that it allows parents to connect with other parents and share their experiences.</p>
    <p>One of the examples shared during the workshop was about the importance of praise in a child's development. Studies have shown that praising a child's effort and hard work instead of their intelligence can lead to a growth mindset and better long-term outcomes. This was something that I had never thought about before and it made me realize that the words and phrases I use with my children can have a big impact.</p>
    <p>Another example was about positive discipline. The speaker talked about how discipline is not just about punishment, but also about teaching and guiding children to make better choices. By using positive discipline techniques, such as setting clear expectations, offering choices, and using natural or logical consequences, parents can help their children develop self-discipline and problem-solving skills.</p>
    <p>Overall, the Parenting Workshop provided me with a lot of valuable information and insights on how to be a better parent. I learned new techniques, connected with other parents, and gained confidence in my parenting skills. I highly recommend this workshop to any parent who wants to improve their parenting skills and connect with other parents.</p>

    <p>During the last year's workshop, I met another mother who had a child with similar behavioral issues as my son. We shared our experiences and some of the techniques we were using to help our children. This connection was invaluable to me as I felt less alone and more equipped to deal with my son's behavior. This year, I am looking forward to connecting with other parents and learning more about positive parenting techniques.</p>
