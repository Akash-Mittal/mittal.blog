   <p>It's not uncommon for new parents or expectant parents to seek advice from those who have gone through the ropes; thus, being in the limelight does not make the famous any different. Recently, Actress Lindsay Lohan was spotted having lunch with Jamie Lee Curtis. The pair had worked together on the 2003 movie <i>Freaky Friday,</i> in which they played a teenage daughter and mother who switched bodies for a day, and it's no surprise that Lohan turned to Curtis for guidance in some of the challenges of motherhood.</p>
   <p>During the lunch, Lohan reportedly asked for advice on a variety of parenting subjects, ranging from pregnancy to the early years of a baby's life. Curtis, who has two grown children of her own, was more than happy to oblige, sharing insights from her own experiences.</p>
   <p>This incident is not isolated, as many new and expectant parents often find themselves in need of guidance in areas that they feel they may not be fully equipped to handle. Here are some quantifiable examples on why seeking parenting advice is important:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Reduced risk of postpartum depression:</strong> According to a study published in the Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women's Health, women who received social support and had access to information about infant and maternal health during pregnancy had a significantly lower risk of developing postpartum depression.</li>
    <li><strong>Better developmental outcomes for children:</strong> Research shows that parent education programs, which provide parents with information about child development and behavior guidance, have been linked to improved developmental outcomes in children.</li>
    <li><strong>Improved child and parent mental health:</strong> A study published in Pediatrics found that parents who received home visits from a nurse or trained healthcare professional during the first few years of their child's life reported fewer mental health problems for both themselves and their children.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>It's clear that seeking parenting advice can have a number of benefits for parents and children alike. Here are some practical tips to consider when seeking guidance:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Turn to trusted sources: Whether it's family, friends or a professional, make sure you're seeking advice from people who have your best interests at heart.</li>
    <li>Keep an open mind: Every child is different, and what works for one family may not work for another. Be willing to try different strategies and methods.</li>
    <li>Don't be afraid to ask for help: There's nothing wrong with admitting that you need help, and there are plenty of resources available to support new and expectant parents.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>In conclusion, seeking parenting advice is a crucial step for new and expectant parents. Not only can it lead to improved mental health outcomes for both parents and children, but it can also provide support and guidance during what can be a challenging time. Remember to turn to trusted sources, keep an open mind and don't be afraid to ask for help.</p>
