    <p>Picture this: it's a Saturday afternoon and you're trying to take a nap, but your child won't stop playing video games. You tell them to take a break and go outside, but they resist. They argue that all their friends are online and they don't want to miss out on anything. Sound familiar?</p>
    <p>This scenario is becoming all too common in the digital age. Children are spending more and more time on screens, which can take a toll on their mental health. But as a parent, you have the power to make a difference.</p>
