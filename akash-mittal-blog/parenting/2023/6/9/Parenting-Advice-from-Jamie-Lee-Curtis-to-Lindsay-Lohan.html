    <p>It's no secret that being a parent is a tough job. Even celebrities struggle to balance their careers and personal lives while raising children. Recently, Lindsay Lohan sought the advice of fellow actress Jamie Lee Curtis on how to be a better parent.</p>
    <p>Curtis, a mother of two, has been open about her experiences with parenting and the importance of being present for her children. She shared some valuable insights with Lohan, who has had her fair share of ups and downs in both her personal and professional life.</p>
    <p>One of the key pieces of advice Curtis gave to Lohan was the importance of setting boundaries with her children. As a single mother, Lohan has expressed difficulty in balancing her work commitments with spending quality time with her two young children. Curtis emphasized the need for Lohan to prioritize her children and make clear boundaries that would allow her to focus on their needs.</p>
    <p>Another area that Curtis addressed was the use of social media. Lohan, like many celebrities, has a large following on social media platforms such as Instagram and Twitter. Curtis warned Lohan of the dangers of overexposing her children on social media and the importance of maintaining their privacy. She also advised Lohan to be mindful of her own social media usage and how it could impact her children.</p>
    <p>Curtis stressed that being a parent is not just about providing for your children financially, but also emotionally. She encouraged Lohan to prioritize her mental and emotional health so that she could be the best parent possible. This includes seeking help when needed and taking care of oneself.</p>
    <p>Perhaps the most powerful advice Curtis gave Lohan was the importance of being present for her children. In an age where technology and social media often dominate our attention, Curtis reminded Lohan that children simply want to feel loved and valued. Curtis encouraged Lohan to put down her phone and spend quality time with her children, free from distractions.</p>
    <h2>Quantifiable examples</h2>
    <p>Studies show that parents who spend quality time with their children have a stronger bond with them and are more likely to raise happy, well-adjusted kids. According to a study by the American Academy of Pediatrics, children who have positive relationships with their parents are less likely to engage in risky behaviors such as drug and alcohol use.</p>
    <p>Research also points to the negative impact of social media on children's mental health. A study by the Royal Society for Public Health found that social media use is linked to increased rates of anxiety and depression in young people. By being mindful of her own social media usage and protecting her children's privacy online, Lohan can help mitigate some of these negative effects.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, parenting is a challenging but rewarding job. Lindsay Lohan can learn from the advice of Jamie Lee Curtis, who stressed the importance of setting boundaries, being present, and prioritizing emotional and mental health. By following these tips, Lohan can build a strong relationship with her children and provide the love and support they need to thrive.</p>
