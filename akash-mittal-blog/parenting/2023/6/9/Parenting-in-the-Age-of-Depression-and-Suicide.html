  <p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide rates among children and teenagers have increased by 56% in the past decade. In addition, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) reports that the rate of youth experiencing a major depressive episode has increased by 37% since 2005. These statistics are alarming, but they also highlight the urgent need for parents to take a proactive role in their children's mental health.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>As a parent, it's easy to feel overwhelmed and helpless when it comes to discussing depression and suicide with your child. However, ignoring the issue is not an option. It's time to acknowledge the reality of the situation and equip ourselves with the knowledge and tools needed to help our children navigate these difficult waters.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Personal Anecdote: A friend of mine, Jenny, recently shared how her teenage daughter was struggling with depression. Jenny felt lost and unsure of how to help her daughter during such a difficult time. She realized it was time to have an open and honest conversation with her daughter about her emotions and encourage her to seek professional help. Today, her daughter is doing much better, and they both feel that their relationship is stronger than ever.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable Examples: According to a recent survey of mental health professionals, these are some common signs of depression in children and teens:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Withdrawing from friends and family</p>
  <p>2. Difficulty focusing or paying attention</p>
  <p>3. Changes in eating habits</p>
  <p>4. Lack of interest or motivation</p>
  <p>5. Changes in sleep patterns</p>
  <p>6. Engaging in risky behavior or substance abuse</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>If your child exhibits any of these behaviors, it's important to seek professional help immediately.</p>
