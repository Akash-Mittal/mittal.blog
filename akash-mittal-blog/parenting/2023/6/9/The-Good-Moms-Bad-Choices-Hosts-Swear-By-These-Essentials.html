   <p>Parenting is no easy feat. It requires constant energy, attention, and effort. For Milah Mapp and Erica Dickerson, hosts of the popular podcast 'Good Moms Bad Choices', being a good mom also means making the right choices. And part of those choices include a set of essentials they swear by. Here are some of the parenting must-haves based on their experience:</p>
  </div>
  <div>
   <h2>The Essentials</h2>
   <ul>
    <li><h3>Wellness Books</h3><p>Parenting can be overwhelming, and sometimes we need guidance and support. That's where wellness books come in handy. Reading books that provide insight on self-care, mindfulness, and healthy living can help moms feel empowered and equipped to take on the challenges of parenting. Milah and Erica recommend "The Body Is Not an Apology" by Sonya Renee Taylor and "The Artist's Way" by Julia Cameron.</p></li>
    <li><h3>Discord</h3><p>Communication is key in any relationship, including parenting. Milah and Erica found that using Discord, a popular chat app for gamers, has helped them in co-parenting their children. With Discord, they can easily communicate with their children's other parent, share information about school projects, appointments, and schedules. The app also allows them to create private channels for family discussions, keeping everyone on the same page.</p></li>
    <li><h3>Shea Butter</h3><p>As moms, we often neglect our own self-care routines, but taking care of ourselves is just as important as taking care of our children. Milah and Erica recommend using shea butter, a natural moisturizer with healing properties, to keep their skin soft and hydrated. Shea butter is also known for reducing inflammation and improving collagen production, making it a great addition to any beauty routine.</p></li>
   </ul>
   <p>These essentials are just the tip of the iceberg. Every mom has their own set of must-haves that work for them. But what's important is that we take the time to find what works for us. As Milah and Erica say, "Good moms make good choices, and bad moms make good choices too."</p>
