    <p>Lohan welcomed her first child, a son named Landon, in 2010 with her then-partner Michael Lohan. Since then, she has been vocal about her struggles with addiction and her efforts to turn her life around.</p>
    <p>In an interview with <em>Oprah Winfrey</em> in 2013, Lohan discussed her desire to be a better parent and her commitment to sobriety. She has also spoken openly about the challenges of co-parenting with her ex-partner and the importance of putting her child's needs first.</p>
    <p>Recently, Lohan has been using social media to share glimpses of her life as a mom. She has posted photos of herself spending time with her kids, attending school events, and taking family vacations.</p>
    <p>While Lohan's parenting journey has had its ups and downs, it's clear that she is committed to being a good mom and learning from those around her, including Jamie Lee Curtis.</p>
