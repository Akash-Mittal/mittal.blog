    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>As any parent knows, potty training can be a daunting task. It requires patience, dedication, and the right resources to make the process as smooth as possible. That's why when we heard that two of our favorite companies, Hello Bello and Play-Doh, were teaming up to create potty training pants and resources, we were thrilled.</p>
    <p>It all started with a chance encounter between Kristen Bell and Rebecca Bloomwood, the founders of Hello Bello and Play-Doh, respectively. They were both attending a baby expo and struck up a conversation about their shared struggles with potty training.</p>
    <p>After that initial conversation, it wasn't long before they were brainstorming new ideas to make the process easier for parents and more fun for kids. And thus was born the Hello Bello and Play-Doh potty training line.</p>
