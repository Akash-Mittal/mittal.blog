  <h3>2. Practice Good Self-Care</h3>
  <p>In addition to emphasizing the importance of being there for her children, Curtis has also stressed the importance of taking care of oneself in order to be a better parent.</p>
  <p>Lohan has taken this advice to heart as well, and has made a concerted effort to prioritize self-care, including regular exercise and therapy sessions, in order to be in the best possible mental and physical health for her children.</p>
  <h3>3. Lead by Example</h3>
  <p>Curtis has also stressed the importance of leading by example, both in terms of behavior and attitudes.</p>
  <p>Lohan has taken this advice to heart as well, and has worked hard to model positive behavior for her children, including healthy communication and conflict resolution skills.</p>
  <p>Overall, Lohan credits Curtis with helping her become a better parent and person, and is grateful for the guidance and support she has received.</p>

   <p>It's not uncommon to seek advice from fellow parents, even if they're celebrities. That's exactly what Lindsay Lohan did recently when she turned to Jamie Lee Curtis for parenting advice.</p>
   <p>The two actresses starred together in the 2003 movie "Freaky Friday," where they portrayed a mother and daughter who swapped bodies and had to navigate each other's lives for a day. Curtis, who has two adult children of her own, shared some valuable insights with Lohan.</p>
   <p>"Jamie gave me some great advice about balancing work and parenting," Lohan said in an interview with People. "She reminded me that children need quality time with their parents, not just quantity."</p>
   <p>These words of wisdom are especially important for Lohan, who recently shared that she is a single mother to two young children. In addition to her acting career, Lohan also runs her own businesses and has to find a way to balance it all.</p>
   <p>But Jamie Lee Curtis isn't the only celebrity to offer parenting advice. Many famous parents have shared their own experiences and tips for raising children. Here are a few quantifiable examples:</p>
   <h2>1. Chrissy Teigen and John Legend</h2>
   <p>The couple, who have two children together, have been open about their struggles with infertility and postpartum depression. They've also shared their approaches to discipline and communication with their kids.</p>
   <p>Tip: Encourage communication and empathy in your children by modeling these behaviors yourself.</p>
   <h2>2. Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith</h2>
   <p>The Smiths have two children together, as well as a son from Will's previous marriage. They've discussed their parenting philosophies, which include setting boundaries and fostering independence.</p>
   <p>Tip: Set clear boundaries and explain the reasons behind them, while also giving your children the freedom to make their own choices.</p>
   <h2>3. Beyoncé and Jay-Z</h2>
   <p>The power couple has three children together and have opened up about their struggles with miscarriage and difficult pregnancies. They've also shared how they prioritize family time despite their busy schedules.</p>
   <p>Tip: Prioritize quality time with your kids by scheduling regular family outings and activities.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>Parenting is a challenging but rewarding experience, and seeking advice from others is often valuable. Whether it's from a fellow parent or a celebrity, the insights and tips they share can help you navigate the ups and downs of raising children. Remember these three points:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Quality time with your children is more important than quantity.</li>
    <li>Encourage communication and empathy in your children by modeling these behaviors yourself.</li>
    <li>Set clear boundaries and explain the reasons behind them, while also giving your children the freedom to make their own choices.</li>
