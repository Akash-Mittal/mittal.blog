    <p>Summer break is an exciting time for kids, but it can also be a time when they spend too much time in front of screens. As a parent, it's important to set limits on screen time and encourage other activities that promote physical and mental wellness.</p>
    
    <p>Last summer, I took my son on a camping trip in Maine. We were completely disconnected from technology, and it was one of the best experiences of our lives. We spent our days hiking, fishing, and exploring the beautiful scenery. When we returned home, I noticed a significant change in my son's behavior. He was more present, engaged, and active. This experience inspired me to help other parents limit their kids' screen time over summer break.</p>
    
    <ul>
     <li>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no more than two hours of screen time per day for children ages 2-5 and no more than one hour for children ages 6-18.</li>
     <li>A study by Common Sense Media found that children ages 8-12 spend an average of four to six hours a day on screens, not counting school work.</li>
     <li>A survey by the Maine Department of Education found that only 31% of Maine children get the recommended daily amount of physical activity.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Limiting Screen Time: Five Ways to Keep Maine Kids Active and Engaged This Summer</p>
    <h2>Three-Point Conclusion</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>Set specific time limits on screen time and stick to them.</li>
     <li>Encourage physical activity and outdoor play.</li>
     <li>Plan fun and engaging activities that don't involve screens, such as arts and crafts, board games, and sports.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
    <p>One of my clients, a mother of two, was struggling to limit her children's screen time during summer break. We worked together to create a schedule that included specific times for screen time, outdoor play, and other activities. The mother was surprised to see how quickly her children adapted to the new schedule and began engaging in more physical and creative activities.</p>
    <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>Set specific time limits on screen time and stick to them.</li>
     <li>Encourage physical activity and outdoor play by scheduling time for these activities each day.</li>
     <li>Plan fun and engaging activities that don't involve screens, such as arts and crafts, board games, and sports.</li>
     <li>Encourage reading by taking kids to the library or bookstore, or by setting aside time for reading each day.</li>
     <li>Limit access to screens by keeping devices in a central location and monitoring usage.</li>
    </ul>
