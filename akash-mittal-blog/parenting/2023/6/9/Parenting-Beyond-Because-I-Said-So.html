  <h1>The Rise of Child and Teen Depression and Suicide: A Call to Go Beyond "Because I Said So" Parenting</h1></br> <img src="images/Parenting-Beyond-Because-I-Said-So.jpeg" alt="+Parenting-Beyond-Because-I-Said-So+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.statesboroherald.com/life/because-i-said-so-just-isnt-going-cut-it-when-parenting/" target="_blank" href="https://www.statesboroherald.com/life/because-i-said-so-just-isnt-going-cut-it-when-parenting/" rel="noopener">https://www.statesboroherald.com/life/because-i-said-so-just-isnt-going-cut-it-when-parenting/</a></span></h5>
  <p>As a parent, you know that it's only natural to want the best for your kids. You want them to grow up happy, healthy, and well-adjusted. Unfortunately, the rates of child and teen depression and suicide continue to rise, as they have for 50 years, despite all our best efforts.</p>
  <p>As regular readers of this column know, I do not agree in the least with current explanations, much less the "treatments" based on them, proposed by the mainstream in the mental health professions. So what can parents do to help prevent their children from becoming statistics?</p>
  <h2>An interesting story</h2>
  <p>Julie had always been a good student. She had a close group of friends, was involved in extracurricular activities, and had a supportive family. But as she started high school, things began to change. She became more anxious and preoccupied with her grades, and started withdrawing from her friends and family. When her parents tried to talk to her about it, she would shut down or get angry. It wasn't until her grades started slipping and she started skipping school that they realized something was really wrong.</p>
  <h2>Some quantifiable examples</h2>
  <p>According to the National Institute of Mental Health:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Depressive episodes are increasing among teens, with a higher percentage of girls affected than boys.</li>
   <li>The suicide rate for children ages 5-11 has doubled since 1993</li>
   <li>Between 2007 and 2015, the suicide rate for teens between ages 15 and 19 increased by 31%.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These numbers are alarming, and they highlight the fact that we need to do more to support our children.</p>

  <p>Parenting Beyond "Because I Said So": A Call to Action for Our Children's Mental Health</p>
  <h2>Personal anecdotes and case studies</h2>
  <p>As a therapist, I have seen firsthand the devastating effects that depression and anxiety can have on children and families. But I have also seen the power of parents who are willing to go beyond the traditional "because I said so" parenting style and truly engage with their children.</p>
  <p>One mother I worked with noticed that her son had become more withdrawn and disengaged from his hobbies and friends. Instead of pressuring him to "snap out of it" or telling him to "just be happy," she sat down with him and asked him what was going on. They spent hours talking about his fears and insecurities, and together they came up with a plan to address them. It wasn't always easy, but over time, her son started to open up more, re-engage with his passions, and build stronger and deeper relationships with his family and friends.</p>
  <h2>Practical tips</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>Listen, really listen, to your children when they speak to you. Don't dismiss their concerns or brush them off. Validate their feelings and let them know that you are there for them.</li>
   <li>Model healthy coping strategies. Take care of yourself, prioritize self-care, and show your children that it's okay to seek help when you need it.</li>
   <li>If your child is struggling, seek out professional support. There is no shame in asking for help, and therapy can be a powerful tool for healing and growth.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion in 3 points</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>Child and teen depression and suicide rates continue to rise, and we need to take action to better support our children's mental health.</li>
   <li>Traditional "because I said so" parenting styles are not enough when it comes to addressing mental health concerns. We need to be willing to truly engage with our children and listen to their concerns.</li>
   <li>By modeling healthy coping strategies, seeking professional support when needed, and prioritizing our children's emotional well-being, we can help our children thrive.</li>
  </ul>
