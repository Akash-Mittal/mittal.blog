   <p>As a former corporate executive, Reena Vokoun knows what it's like to live life in the fast lane. As a Type A personality, she was always striving for success, but her health was paying the price. Then, one day, everything changed.</p>
   <p>Reena had a wake-up call when she was diagnosed with a serious medical condition that forced her to reevaluate her priorities and make some major lifestyle changes. Today, she's a health and wellness expert who helps other busy professionals find balance in their lives.</p>
   <p>Here are some of Reena's top tips for incorporating health into a stressful lifestyle:</p>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>Make time for self-care</strong></li>
    <p>Whether it's meditation, yoga, or simply taking a walk outside, it's important to carve out some time for yourself every day. Reena recommends scheduling it into your calendar like you would any other appointment. "It's not selfish to take care of yourself," she says. "It's necessary."</p>
    <li><strong>Eat for energy</strong></li>
    <p>When you're constantly on the go, it can be tempting to grab convenience foods like fast food or energy drinks. But these can actually do more harm than good in the long run. Reena suggests focusing on foods that will give you sustained energy throughout the day, like protein, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates.</p>
    <li><strong>Get moving</strong></li>
    <p>Exercise doesn't have to be a chore. In fact, Reena says it's all about finding something you enjoy and making it a part of your routine. This could be anything from a dance class to a hike in the mountains. "The important thing is to move your body every day," she says.</p>
   </ol>
   <p>By incorporating these practices into your life, you can start to find more balance and take better care of yourself. Remember, as Reena says, "You can't pour from an empty cup."</p>
