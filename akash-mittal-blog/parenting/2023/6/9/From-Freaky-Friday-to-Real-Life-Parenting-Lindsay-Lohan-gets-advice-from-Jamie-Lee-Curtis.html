  <p>Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis starred together in the 2003 film "Freaky Friday", where they swapped bodies and had to navigate each other's lives for a day. Now, almost 20 years later, Lohan is turning to Curtis for another type of role: parenting advisor.</p>
  <p>According to sources close to the actresses, Lohan has been struggling to adapt to the demands of motherhood, after giving birth to her first child in September last year. As a single mom, Lohan has found it challenging to juggle her career, her social life, and her daughter's needs, and has been looking for guidance from someone with experience in all those areas.</p>
  <p>Curtis, who has two grown-up children and has been married for over 35 years, has been more than happy to oblige. "Lindsay is like family to me", she said in a recent interview. "I remember holding her hand on set when she was just a kid, and now I'm holding her hand in real life. It's a beautiful thing."</p>
  <p>The two actresses have been spending time together both on and off the set, and Curtis has been sharing her wisdom on everything from sleep training to social media boundaries. Lindsay has been taking notes, and putting some of Curtis' advice into practice.</p>
  <h2>Quantifiable examples</h2>
  <p>Here are some of the concrete tips that Jamie Lee Curtis has given Lindsay Lohan, and how they have benefited her:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>Establish a routine:</strong> Curtis has advised Lohan to create a predictable schedule for her daughter, with set times for feeding, playtime, naps, and bedtime. This has helped Lohan's baby sleep better at night, and has given Lohan more control over her own schedule.</li>
   <li><strong>Limit screen time:</strong> Curtis has warned Lohan about the drawbacks of letting her child watch too much television or play with smartphones or tablets. Lohan has noticed that her daughter is more engaged and less cranky when she has fewer digital distractions, and has also found more quality time to spend with her.</li>
   <li><strong>Find a support system:</strong> Curtis has encouraged Lohan to lean on her friends and family when she needs help or advice. Lohan has been grateful for the emotional support and practical help she has received from her loved ones, and has been able to reduce her stress levels as a result.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These are just a few examples of the ways in which Jamie Lee Curtis has impacted Lindsay Lohan's parenting journey, but they illustrate the power of practical and personalized advice.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, we can see that celebrities may face unique challenges when it comes to parenting, but they can also benefit from finding mentors and friends who can offer a guiding hand. The story of Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis shows us that even Hollywood stars can struggle with the demands of motherhood, and that seeking support and advice is not a sign of weakness, but of strength.</p>
  <p>To sum up, here are the three key takeaways from this article:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Parenting can be both rewarding and challenging, and having a support system is crucial for success.</li>
   <li>Personalized advice and mentorship can make a real difference in a new parent's life.</li>
   <li>Celebrities are people too, and can benefit from the same kind of guidance and empathy as anyone else.</li>
