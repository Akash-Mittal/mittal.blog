    <p>As a child, Lindsay Lohan starred in the 2003 film "Freaky Friday," where she played the rebellious daughter who, through a series of events, swaps bodies with her mother, played by Jamie Lee Curtis. Now, years later, the two actresses are reuniting, with Jamie Lee Curtis offering Lindsay some much-needed advice on parenting.</p>
    <p>Lohan, the mother of two young boys, has had her fair share of ups and downs in the spotlight. From her highly publicized legal troubles to her struggles with addiction, Lindsay has had to navigate the challenges of parenthood while also dealing with her own personal demons.</p>
    <p>But with the support of her friend and former co-star, Jamie Lee Curtis, Lindsay is determined to be the best mother she can be. "Jamie has always been like a second mom to me," Lindsay says. "She's been through it all, and she's always been there to offer guidance and support."</p>
    <p>So what advice has Jamie Lee Curtis been offering Lindsay? Let's take a look.</p>

   <div class="examples">
    
    <ul>
     <li>Establishing a routine: Jamie Lee Curtis stressed the importance of establishing a routine for her children, including set meal times, bedtime, and playtime.
