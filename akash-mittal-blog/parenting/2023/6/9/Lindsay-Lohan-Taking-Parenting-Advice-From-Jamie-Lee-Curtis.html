   <p>There's no denying that Lindsay Lohan has had her fair share of ups and downs over the years. From child stardom to rehab, the actress has been through a lot. But now, with her own children to raise, Lohan is turning to a Hollywood veteran for some much-needed parenting advice: Jamie Lee Curtis.</p>
   <p>Curtis, known for her iconic roles in films like "Halloween" and "True Lies," has also been a successful parent to her two children with husband Christopher Guest. According to sources close to Lohan, the actress recently reached out to Curtis for guidance on navigating the challenges of motherhood.</p>
   <p>"Lindsay knows that Jamie Lee has been through it all as a parent and has come out the other side with two incredible kids," the source said. "She's looking for advice on how to balance her career and motherhood, how to handle the media attention on her children, and how to provide a stable home life."</p>
   <p>Lohan has frequently been in the headlines over the years for her partying, legal troubles, and tumultuous personal life, but it seems that becoming a mother has put things into perspective for her.</p>
   <p>"Having children has been a wake-up call for Lindsay," the source continued. "She wants to be the best mother she can be and she knows that she has a lot to learn. Jamie Lee is someone she looks up to and trusts, so it's no surprise that she's turning to her for help."</p>
   <p>This isn't the first time that Curtis has offered her expertise on parenting. In 2018, the actress penned an op-ed for USA Today in which she shared her experiences raising children in Hollywood.</p>
   <p>"Being a mom is not easy, but being a mom in Hollywood can be even harder," Curtis wrote. "There is the pressure to look perfect, to have the perfect family, to be the perfect parent. But guess what? None of us are perfect."</p>
   <p>Curtis went on to offer advice on everything from setting boundaries with the media to dealing with the inevitable struggles that come with raising teenagers.</p>
   <p>So, what can we learn from Lohan and Curtis's relationship? Here are three key takeaways:</p>
   <h2>1. It's okay to ask for help</h2>
   <p>Being a parent is hard work, and it's okay to admit that you don't have all the answers. Seeking advice and guidance from others is a sign of strength, not weakness.</p>
   <h2>2. Find a role model</h2>
   <p>Having someone to look up to and model your own parenting style after can be incredibly helpful. Whether it's a family member, friend, or celebrity, finding a role model who shares your values and parenting philosophy can be a great source of support.</p>
   <h2>3. Remember that no one is perfect</h2>
   <p>As Curtis noted in her op-ed, no one is a perfect parent. We all make mistakes and have moments of doubt and uncertainty. The key is to learn from those mistakes and keep moving forward.</p>
   <p>So, here's to Lindsay Lohan for seeking out the advice and support she needs to be the best mother she can be. And here's to Jamie Lee Curtis for being an inspiration to parents everywhere.</p>
