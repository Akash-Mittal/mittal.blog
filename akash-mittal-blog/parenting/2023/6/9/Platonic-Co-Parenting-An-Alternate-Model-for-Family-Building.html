     <h2>A New Way to Build a Family</h2>
     <p>When Sarah and John first met, they knew they wanted to start a family together. However, they didn't want to get married and didn't want a romantic relationship. Instead, they decided to explore platonic co-parenting as an alternative model for family building.</p>
     <p>Platonic co-parenting is when two or more people decide to have and raise a child together without being in a romantic relationship. It's a growing trend among millennials who prioritize co-parenting over marriage and romantic relationships.</p>
     <p>According to a survey by Modamily, a website that connects co-parents and donors, there has been a 74% increase in platonic co-parenting profiles since 2014. This shows that more and more people are interested in this alternative model for family building.</p>

     <h2>The Benefits of Platonic Co-Parenting</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>Shared responsibility: With platonic co-parenting, the responsibilities of raising a child are shared among two or more parents. This means that there is no one person who is solely responsible for the child's upbringing.</li>
      <li>Financial benefits: Co-parenting can also be financially beneficial because the costs of raising a child can be shared among the parents.</li>
      <li>Diversity of parenting styles: With multiple parents, a child can benefit from different parenting styles, which can lead to a more well-rounded upbringing.</li>
      <li>Flexibility: With platonic co-parenting, parents have more flexibility to pursue their own interests and careers because they can share the responsibilities of raising a child.</li>
     </ul>
