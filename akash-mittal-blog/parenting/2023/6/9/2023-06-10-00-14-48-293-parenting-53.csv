"2023-06-10 02:10 PM;","It was my daughter's 5th birthday last month and I wanted to do something special for her. But with work and other commitments, I didn't have the time or energy to plan a big party or buy a lot of presents. So I decided to take a different approach.
Instead of material gifts, I gave her the gift of memories. I planned a fun day full of activities we could enjoy together as a family, creating memories that would last a lifetime.
Research has shown that experiences and memories make us happier than material possessions. In fact, a study by Cornell University found that people were more likely to experience sustained happiness from experiential purchases (such as a vacation) than from material purchases (such as a new car).
So instead of spending money on toys or clothes that would eventually be forgotten or discarded, I invested in experiences that my daughter could cherish forever.
Through these experiences, we laughed, we bonded, and we made memories that will last a lifetime. And the best part is, these memories don't take up any space in our home or contribute to clutter.

"2023-06-10 02:20 PM;","We all know that mental health is essential to a happy and fulfilling life. Unfortunately, we don't always pay enough attention to our mental health, especially in our younger years. However, research shows how crucial it is to prioritize mental health in childhood and parenting.
The story of Emily and her daughter Laura exemplifies why prioritizing mental health in childhood and parenting is crucial. Emily, a single mother, was dedicated to providing everything possible to make her daughter's life as comfortable as possible. She was so focused on this that she worked for long hours every day, sometimes sacrificing her own sleep to provide her daughter support. But despite her best efforts, Laura started experiencing anxiety and depression symptoms at a young age. Emily took her daughter to a mental health professional, who diagnosed Laura with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). Emily realized that while she had been providing Laura with all the material comforts, she had inadvertently neglected Laura's mental health. This realization led her to prioritize Laura's mental health, and she started making arrangements to provide her with regular mental health support.
Here are some quantitative facts about mental health in childhood:
