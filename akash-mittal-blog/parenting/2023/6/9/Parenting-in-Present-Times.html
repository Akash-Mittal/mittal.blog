   <p>When I was a child, parenting was simpler. There were clear rules and boundaries, and the role of a parent was seen as more traditional. However, as I raise my own children, I realize that parenting in present times is much different. The world has changed, and with it, the challenges of raising well-adjusted, emotionally stable children have become more complex.</p>
   <h2>The Changing World</h2>
   <p>One of the most significant changes in our society is the impact of technology. Children today are growing up in a world that is always connected, and their lives are often dominated by screens. This has led to an increase in issues such as cyberbullying, social anxiety, and a lack of real-world social skills. Parents must learn how to manage their children's screen time and teach them healthy technology habits that promote positive interactions.</p>
   <p>Another change in the last several decades is the increase in working mothers. In the past, most children had a parent who was home to care for them, but now, most households require two incomes to survive. This means that children often spend more time in daycare or after-school care. Parents must be intentional about creating quality time with their children and building strong relationships despite the limited time.</p>
   
   <p>The effects of these changes can be seen in the mental health of our children. According to a report from the National Institute of Mental Health, approximately 1 in 5 children in the U.S. has a mental health disorder. The most common issues are anxiety and depression, with rates increasing significantly among teenagers.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, a recent study found that children who spend more than two hours a day on social media and electronic devices score lower on cognitive tests than those who have less screen time. This trend is alarming, as it suggests that excessive screen time may have a negative impact on children's brain development and cognitive abilities.</p>
   <h2>Practical Tips for Parenting in Present Times</h2>
   <p>So how can parents navigate these challenges and raise healthy, happy children? Here are three key tips:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Limit screen time and encourage technology-free activities. Spend time with your children doing things that don't involve screens, such as playing board games, reading together, or going for walks. Encourage outdoor play and physical activity to help your child build social and emotional skills.</li>
    <li>Create a strong support system. Connect with other parents and seek out resources for support. Join parenting groups, attend conferences, or seek professional counseling if needed. Building a strong support system will help you navigate the challenges of parenting and provide you with the tools and resources to help your child succeed.</li>
    <li>Be intentional about quality time. Even when time is limited, make the most of the time you have with your children. Plan fun activities and outings that allow you to connect and build positive memories. Talk to your child and listen to their feelings and concerns. Show them that they are loved and valued.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>Parenting in present times is not easy, but it's important to remember that we are not alone in this journey. By being intentional about our time, building a strong support system, and limiting screen time, we can raise healthy, happy children who are equipped to navigate the complex world around them.</p>
