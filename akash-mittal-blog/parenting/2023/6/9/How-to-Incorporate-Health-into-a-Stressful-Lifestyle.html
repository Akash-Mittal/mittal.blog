    <p>It's no secret that life can be stressful, and for Type A personalities like Reena Vokoun, that stress can be amplified. Vokoun used to work in corporate America, where she felt overwhelmed and burnt out. But she knew she needed to make a change for the sake of her health and well-being.</p>
    <p>Vokoun started her own business as a wellness coach and has since helped countless individuals find balance and manage stress in their lives. Below, we've compiled some of her top tips for incorporating health into a stressful lifestyle.</p>
    
    <ul>
     <li>According to the American Heart Association, stress can increase the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, and obesity.</li>
     <li>A study published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics found that stress can lead to unhealthy food choices and increased calorie consumption.</li>
     <li>On the other hand, research shows that healthy habits like exercise and meditation can reduce stress levels and improve overall well-being.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>Make time for self-care: This could mean taking a yoga class, getting a massage, or simply setting aside some alone time each day to meditate or practice mindfulness.</li>
     <li>Find an activity you enjoy: Exercise doesn't have to be a chore. Whether it's dancing, hiking, or playing a sport, find something that you actually look forward to doing.</li>
     <li>Eat mindfully: When we're stressed, it can be tempting to reach for junk food or indulge in comfort foods. Instead, try to choose nutritious foods that will fuel your body and help you feel more energized.</li>
     <li>Get enough sleep: It's important to prioritize rest and relaxation, especially when you're feeling stressed out. Make sure you're getting enough sleep each night and consider establishing a bedtime routine to help you wind down.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>Don't ignore stress: It's important to recognize when you're feeling overwhelmed and take steps to manage your stress levels.</li>
     <li>Make health a priority: Incorporating healthy habits into your daily routine can help you feel better both physically and mentally.</li>
     <li>Find what works for you: Everyone is different, so experiment with different self-care practices, physical activities, and healthy eating habits to find what resonates with you.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Incorporating health into a stressful lifestyle is no easy feat, but with a little bit of effort and intention, it's possible to create a more balanced and fulfilling life. If you're feeling overwhelmed, take a cue from Vokoun and make your health and well-being a top priority.</p>
