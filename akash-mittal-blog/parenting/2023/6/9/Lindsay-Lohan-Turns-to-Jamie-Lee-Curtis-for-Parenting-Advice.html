  <p>Once upon a time, Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis starred in the hit movie 'Freaky Friday' as mother and daughter who switch bodies. Fast forward to present day and the former child star is seeking the advice of her on-screen mother for real-life motherhood.</p>
  <p>According to sources close to Lohan, she has been struggling with balancing her career with raising her two children and decided to turn to Curtis for guidance. The actress and author has two children of her own, Annie and Tom, and has been open about her parenting journey.</p>
  <p>"Lindsay reached out to Jamie for advice on balancing work and motherhood," the source said. "She knows Jamie has been there and done that, and she really respects her as a person and a mom."</p>
  <p>Curtis, known for her roles in horror films like 'Halloween' and 'Scream Queens', has also written several children's books including 'When I Was Little: A Four-Year-Old's Memoir of Her Youth'. Her experience in the entertainment industry and as a working mom makes her the perfect person for Lohan to turn to.</p>
  <p>But what exactly has Curtis been advising Lohan on? Here are some quantifiable examples:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Time management: Curtis stresses the importance of setting aside dedicated time for both work and family. She encourages Lohan to create a schedule that prioritizes both her career and her children's needs.</li>
   <li>Self-care: As a mom, it's easy to put everyone else's needs before your own. Curtis reminds Lohan to take care of herself physically and mentally, whether that means working out, meditating, or simply taking a break when needed.</li>
   <li>Quality time: Curtis believes in the power of quality time with loved ones. She encourages Lohan to make time for fun activities with her children, such as going to the park or playing games together.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It's great to see Lohan seeking advice from someone who has been in her shoes, and hopefully her relationship with Jamie Lee Curtis will continue to grow. Here are three key takeaways from Lohan's experience:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>It's okay to seek advice: Being a parent is not easy, and it's important to remember that there's nothing wrong with asking for help.</li>
   <li>Time management is key: Balancing work and family can be overwhelming, but it's important to create a schedule that allows for both.</li>
   <li>Self-care is important: Taking care of yourself physically and mentally is just as important as taking care of your children.</li>
  </ol>

   <p>In a recent interview, Lindsay Lohan has revealed that she has turned to her former co-star in the 2003 remake of â€˜Freaky Friday' for parenting advice. The actress, who is currently pregnant with her first child, has admitted to feeling overwhelmed and unsure about being a mother, and has sought the guidance of Jamie Lee Curtis, who played her on-screen mother in the comedy film.</p>
   <p>Lohan says that Curtis has been a wonderful mentor and friend, offering her valuable insights and support as she prepares for motherhood. Curtis, who is a mother of two, has reportedly shared her own experiences of parenting with Lohan, providing tips on everything from diaper changes and feeding schedules to sleep training and discipline.</p><img src="lindsay-jamie.jpg" alt="Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis in Freaky Friday">
   <p>While some may be surprised to hear that Lohan has turned to a Hollywood star for parenting advice, the truth is that many new parents seek guidance and support from those who have been through it before. In fact, according to a recent survey, more than half of new parents turn to family and friends for advice on how to care for their babies.</p>
   <p>But why is it so important to seek out advice when you become a parent? Here are three reasons why seeking guidance from others is essential:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>It can help you feel more confident:</strong> Being a new parent can be overwhelming and intimidating. Seeking advice from others who have been there before can help you feel more confident in your abilities to care for your child.</li>
    <li><strong>It can provide you with new ideas and perspectives:</strong> Everyone has different approaches to parenting, and what works for one person may not work for another. Seeking advice from a variety of sources can provide you with new ideas and perspectives that may be helpful to you.</li>
    <li><strong>It can give you emotional support:</strong> Raising a child can be an emotional rollercoaster, and having the support of others who understand what you're going through can be invaluable.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Of course, not all advice is created equal, and it's important to use your own judgement and instincts when deciding what to take on board. But seeking guidance and support from others can be a powerful tool for new parents, and can make the transition into parenthood a little bit easier.</p>
