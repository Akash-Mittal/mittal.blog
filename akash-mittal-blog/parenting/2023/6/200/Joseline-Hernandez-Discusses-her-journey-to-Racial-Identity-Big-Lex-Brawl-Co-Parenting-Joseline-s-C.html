  <p>Reality television star, Joseline Hernandez, sat down with Sway Calloway in an exclusive interview where she opened up about her struggles with racial identity, the infamous Big Lex brawl, co-parenting, and more. During the interview, Joseline provided some interesting insights into her life, and her journey to her current place in the entertainment industry.</p>
  <h2>The Journey to Racial Identity</h2>
  <p>Joseline Hernandez was born and raised in Puerto Rico, and she struggled with her racial identity while growing up. Her father is Puerto Rican, while her mother is of African-American and Honduran descent. During the interview, she spoke candidly about how her mixed-race identity made her feel as if she didn't completely belong in either group.</p>
  <p>She said, "I got the Afro-Hispanic in me, so I was always in the middle of the Puerto Rican side and the Afro side. It made me feel like I wasn't black enough, and I wasn't Puerto Rican enough."</p>
  <p>However, Joseline ultimately found confidence in her mixed-race identity and now embraces her heritage boldly. Her journey to self-acceptance is an example that should be followed. It's high time we embrace all of our cultural backgrounds and stop feeling insecure about them.</p>
  <h2>The Big Lex Brawl</h2>
  <p>Joseline's fiery temper played out on the infamous Big Lex brawl that took place on her hit reality TV show, Love &amp; Hip Hop: Atlanta. During the interview, Joseline opened up about the incident and how it affected her.</p>
  <p>She explained that the altercation was not staged and said, "People don't understand that. They don't know how much that fight took out of me. That was a real fight. People think that everything is scripted, but that fight, that was not scripted. That was real. I didn't sign up for that."</p>
  <p>The incident was a turning point in Joseline's career, and despite the backlash she received, she continued to grow and become a well-known reality TV personality.</p>
  <h2>Co-Parenting with Stevie J</h2>
  <p>Joseline Hernandez has a daughter with Stevie J, and it's no secret that their relationship has been rocky. However, the two have been working on co-parenting their daughter, Bonnie Bella, and Joseline provided an update on how things are going.</p>
  <p>She said, "We're co-parenting well. We had a really big issue with each other, but we're over it now. We're keeping it about our daughter and trying to make it work."</p>
  <p>Co-parenting can be difficult, especially when there are animosity and unresolved issues between the parents. However, it's heartwarming to see Joseline and Stevie J putting aside their differences for the sake of their daughter. It's an example that all parents should follow.</p>
  <h2>Joseline's Cabaret</h2>
  <p>The interview concluded with Joseline discussing her new reality show, Joseline's Cabaret. She revealed that the show would follow her as she opens a cabaret club and grooms a group of dancers.</p>
  <p>Joseline emphasized that it would be a raw and uncut look into the world of strip clubs and would provide a voice to women who work in the club industry. She said, "I wanted to show these girls that they can come from the strip club and do big things. They can make a big name for themselves."</p>
  <p>Joseline's Cabaret is a fresh take on the reality TV format, and it's exciting to see a show that's dedicated to empowering women. Joseline's new venture is all about overcoming stereotypes and self-doubt, which is a message that everyone can get behind.</p>
