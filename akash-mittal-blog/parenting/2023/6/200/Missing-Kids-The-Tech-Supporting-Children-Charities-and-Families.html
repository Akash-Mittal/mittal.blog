    <p>Samantha went to the grocery store with her two kids, Jack and Lily. While she was busy picking out some vegetables, Jack wandered off to the toy aisle. Samantha only realized that Jack was nowhere to be seen when she was at the checkout. Her heart started racing and panic set in as she searched frantically for her son. Thankfully, after a few minutes, a store employee found Jack playing with a toy car in the toy aisle. Samantha was relieved, but the experience left her shaken.</p>
    <p>That incident made Samantha realize how easy it is to lose a child, even in a familiar place, and her search for a solution led her to discover the world of technology that is supporting children, charities, and families with missing kids.</p>

    <p>The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) reports that there were more than 421,000 reports of missing children in the United States in 2020 alone. Of these, 91% were endangered runaways, and 99% were eventually located.</p>
    <p>In Canada, the Canadian Centre for Child Protection's Child Search Network assisted in closing 794 missing or currently active cases between 2012 and 2020, resulting in the safe recovery of 463 children.</p>
    <p>These numbers are encouraging, thanks to the use of technology, such as wearable GPS devices, smartphone apps, and social media platforms.</p>

    <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
    <p>Nicole's 12-year-old daughter, Amber, was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) at an early age. One day, while they were at a busy amusement park, Nicole turned around for a second and Amber was gone. She searched frantically for her daughter, but Amber was nowhere to be found. With the help of the amusement park's security and the local police, they were able to locate Amber by tracking her GPS-enabled smartwatch.</p>
    <p>Another example is the case of 4-year-old Emma, who went missing from her backyard while playing with her dog. Her parents immediately contacted the police and used social media to spread the word about their missing daughter. Thanks to the quick actions of her parents and the widespread sharing of their social media posts, Emma was found safe and sound just a few hours later.</p>
    <p>These examples show how technology can be a game-changer in finding missing kids. Wearable GPS devices and smartphone apps can provide real-time tracking of a child's location, while social media platforms can quickly spread the word and mobilize a community in a search effort.</p>
