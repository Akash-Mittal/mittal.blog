    <h2>The Story of a Struggling Mom</h2>
    <p>When Rachel became a mom, she thought she had everything under control. She had read all the books and blogs, and she was ready to be the best parent she could be.</p>
    <p>But then things started to go wrong. Her toddler started throwing tantrums, hitting other kids at the park, and refusing to eat anything that wasn't mac and cheese.</p>
    <p>Rachel tried everything she could think of to change her child's behaviour. She read more books, talked to other parents, and even tried to discipline her child with time-outs and spanking.</p>
    <p>But nothing seemed to work. Her child's behaviour only got worse, and Rachel began to feel like a failure as a parent.</p>

    <h2>Change Your Mindset</h2>
    <p>It wasn't until Rachel talked to an expert that she realized the problem wasn't her child's behaviour, it was her mindset.</p>
    <p>The expert explained that many parents focus on changing their child's behaviour without realizing that they need to change their own mindset first.</p>
    <p>Instead of seeing her child's tantrums as a sign of disobedience or disrespect, Rachel learned to see them as a way for her child to communicate their needs and emotions.</p>
    <p>By changing her mindset, Rachel was able to approach her child's behaviour in a more compassionate and understanding way, which led to better communication and a more peaceful home.</p>
    <p>She also learned that discipline doesn't have to involve punishment or reward, but can instead be a way to teach her child how to make better choices and regulate their own emotions.</p>
    <p>Through this new approach, Rachel was able to help her child overcome their behavioural challenges and foster a deeper connection with them.</p>

    <p>If you're still not convinced that changing your mindset can improve your child's behaviour, consider the following examples:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>A study found that parents who had a growth mindset (ie. they believed their child's abilities could be improved with effort) were more likely to help their child succeed academically than parents who had a fixed mindset (ie. they believed their child's abilities were set in stone).</li>
     <li>Another study found that children whose parents had an authoritative parenting style (ie. they focused on setting clear boundaries and providing reasons for their decisions) were less likely to engage in risky behaviours like smoking and drinking.</li>
     <li>On the other hand, children whose parents had a permissive parenting style (ie. they were very lenient and didn't set many rules) were more likely to engage in these behaviours.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These examples show that a parent's mindset and parenting style can have a significant impact on their child's behaviour and development.</p>
