   <p>Tom Brady, the legendary quarterback of the New England Patriots, caused a stir recently when he shared a photo of his children joyriding handheld jet skis. In the photo, Brady's 8-year-old daughter Vivian and 10-year-old son Benjamin are seen cruising around a lake with their friends, all wearing life jackets but with no adults in sight.</p><img src="jet-skis.jpg" alt="Tom Brady's children joyriding handheld jet skis">
   <p>The photo quickly drew criticism from some parents and child safety advocates, who questioned the wisdom of letting young children operate motorized watercraft without adult supervision. Others defended Brady, arguing that the children were wearing life jackets and had likely received proper training and supervision.</p>
   
   <p>While there is no consensus on the safety of handheld jet skis for children, there are some facts and figures that parents should consider:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>In 2018, the U.S. Coast Guard reported 104 accidents involving personal watercraft, resulting in 46 injuries and 2 fatalities.</li>
    <li>The American Red Cross recommends that children under the age of 16 not operate personal watercraft, and that they should always wear a properly fitted life jacket when boating or swimming.</li>
    <li>According to a study by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, most personal watercraft accidents involving children are caused by a lack of parental supervision and/or poor judgment on the part of the child.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
   <p>Regardless of your stance on handheld jet skis for children, there are some practical tips that parents can follow to ensure that their kids are safe around watercraft:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Always supervise your child when they are operating any type of motorized watercraft, including handheld jet skis.</li>
    <li>Make sure your child is wearing a properly fitted life jacket that meets U.S. Coast Guard standards for buoyancy (this is usually marked on the jacket).</li>
    <li>Enroll your child in a boating safety course that covers the basic rules and regulations of watercraft operation, as well as basic first aid and emergency procedures.</li>
    <li>Set clear rules and boundaries for your child's water activities, such as where they can ride and how fast they can go.</li>
    <li>Consider investing in a GPS tracking device or smartphone app that can track your child's location and speed while they are on the water.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, the debate over the safety of handheld jet skis for children will likely continue. While some parents believe that children can safely operate these devices with proper training and supervision, others argue that the risks are too great and that children should not be allowed to use them at all.</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Regardless of your stance on this issue, it is important to always prioritize your child's safety when they are on or around watercraft.</li>
    <li>Following practical tips like proper supervision, life jacket use, and boating safety education can help reduce the risk of accidents and injuries.</li>
    <li>Ultimately, it is up to each parent to decide what level of risk they are willing to accept for their child, and to take steps to minimize that risk whenever possible.</li>
   </ol>
   <blockquote>
    "As a parent, your number one job is to keep your kids safe and healthy. Whether that means letting them try new things or setting clear boundaries and rules, it's up to you to find the right balance for your family."
