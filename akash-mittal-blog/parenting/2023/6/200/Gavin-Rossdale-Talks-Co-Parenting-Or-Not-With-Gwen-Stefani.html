   <h2>What You Should Know About Successful Co-Parenting</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>It's not easy to navigate co-parenting, especially when things didn't end well with your ex-partner. It can be even harder when you're both in the public eye.</p>
   <p>Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale, who were married for 13 years before splitting in 2015, have been co-parenting their three sons since their breakup. Rossdale recently opened up in an interview with Us Weekly about how they handle co-parenting, or not handling it in some cases.</p>
   <h3>The Good</h3>
   <p>Rossdale shared that he and Stefani are "doing the best we can" when it comes to co-parenting. Despite not always agreeing on everything, they both prioritize their children's well-being and work to make sure their sons have a healthy relationship with both parents.</p>
   <p>He revealed that they celebrate holidays together and make an effort to attend important events in their kids' lives. Rossdale also mentioned that they have a shared love for music and encourage their children in their musical interests, which is something they have in common.</p>
   <p>According to Rossdale, "It's about being consistent, being there, and helping them navigate through whatever things come their way." This is a good example of putting your children's needs first and focusing on co-parenting in a positive way.</p>
   <h3>The Not-So-Good</h3>
   <p>While Rossdale and Stefani are able to co-parent in a relatively healthy manner, there are still some challenges they face. Rossdale admitted that there are times when they have disagreements and don't see eye to eye on certain things.</p>
   <p>He also mentioned that there have been moments where he hasn't been as present as he would have liked to be in his children's lives. This can happen to anyone, especially when you're going through a divorce or a difficult breakup.</p>
   <p>Another challenge that Rossdale has faced is the public scrutiny that comes with being a celebrity. He explained that there have been times when he's been criticized for his parenting or a decision he's made as a parent. This is something that many celebrity parents have to face, but it can also happen to regular parents.</p>
   <h3>Tips for Successful Co-Parenting</h3>
   <p>Co-parenting isn't easy, but there are some things you can do to make it more successful. Here are three tips:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Put your children's needs first: This means prioritizing their well-being and being consistent with your parenting. Try to work together with your ex-partner to create a united front, even if you don't always agree with each other.</li>
    <li>Communicate effectively: Good communication is key to co-parenting. Try to be open with each other, listen to each other's concerns, and find ways to compromise when possible. It's also important to keep your conversations respectful and avoid using your children as messengers.</li>
    <li>Take care of yourself: Co-parenting can be stressful, so it's important to take care of yourself. Make sure you have a support system in place, whether that's friends, family, or a therapist. Take time for self-care and try to maintain a positive outlook.</li>
   </ol>
