   <p>Co-parenting with exes can be a challenging experience, but it doesn't have to be. With the right mindset and approach, it is possible to navigate co-parenting in a way that puts the children first and fosters a positive relationship between exes. Two celebrities who have mastered the art of co-parenting with exes are Jennifer Garner and Sheryl Lee Ralph. Let's take a closer look at their stories and insights.</p>
   <h2>Jennifer Garner's Co-Parenting Journey with Ben Affleck</h2>
   <p>When Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck announced their separation in 2015, many assumed that it would be a messy and contentious divorce. But the couple surprised everyone by their commitment to co-parenting their three children, Violet, Seraphina, and Samuel.</p>
   <p>One of the keys to Jennifer's successful co-parenting journey with Ben is their mutual respect and communication. In a 2019 interview with Vanity Fair, Jennifer explained, "I would not have chosen this life for myself or for my kids. I would not choose to be single or be in this position. It's something that we are working through. I haven't been on a date and I am not interested in dating. People want to set me up and I am just like, 'No thank you!'"</p>
   <p>While it's clear that Jennifer and Ben have their challenges, they make a point of putting their children first. "We are definitely a modern family," Jennifer said in the same interview. "We're doing really well."</p>
   <h2>Sheryl Lee Ralph on Raising a Child with Her Ex-Husband</h2>
   <p>Sheryl Lee Ralph, best known for her roles in "Dreamgirls" and "Moesha," has also had a successful co-parenting journey with her ex-husband, Eric Maurice. The couple has one son together, Etienne, and Sheryl has been open about the challenges and rewards of co-parenting with an ex.</p>
   <p>In an interview with Essence, Sheryl shared, "People think divorce is the end of everything but sometimes it is the beginning of something else. Even though my ex-husband and I are no longer married, that does not mean that we stop being parents to our child."</p>
   <p>Sheryl emphasized the importance of putting the child first and not letting personal feelings get in the way. "Our son does not need to know what happened between us," she said. "He needs to know that he is loved and we are there for him."</p>
   <h2>Practical Tips for Co-Parenting with Exes</h2>
   <p>Based on the stories and insights of Jennifer Garner and Sheryl Lee Ralph, here are some practical tips for co-parenting with exes:</p>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>Put the children first.</strong> The most important thing in co-parenting is ensuring that the children's needs are met and that they feel loved and supported. Make sure to communicate with your ex about your child's schedule, milestones, and any issues that arise.</li>
    <li><strong>Respect your ex and communicate effectively.</strong> Co-parenting requires a certain level of respect and effective communication. Make sure to keep your personal feelings in check and focus on the needs of the children. Use a clear and concise communication method that works for both of you.</li>
    <li><strong>Set boundaries and prioritize self-care.</strong> Co-parenting can be emotionally draining, so it's important to set boundaries and prioritize self-care. Make time for yourself and remember that it's okay to say no to your ex if their request does not align with your values or the needs of your child.</li>
