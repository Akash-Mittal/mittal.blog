     <p>Kelly Clarkson is a well-known singer and television host. She is also a proud mother of two children. In a recent podcast episode, she sat down with author Glennon Doyle to discuss all things parenting, including the challenges and joys that come with raising kids.</p>
     <p>One topic that stood out during the conversation was the importance of setting boundaries for children. Kelly shared a personal story about her son struggling with bedtime and how she learned to enforce boundaries to help him get the rest he needed. This experience led her to realize the value of setting boundaries in all areas of her children's lives.</p>

     <p>Kelly and Glennon also discussed the impact of technology on children. Kelly mentioned that while she sees the benefits of technology, she is mindful of how much screen time her children have each day. She shared that she limits their use of electronic devices to no more than two hours per day. This is in line with the American Academy of Pediatrics' recommendations, which suggest no more than two hours of screen time per day for children ages 2 to 5.</p>
     <p>Furthermore, Kelly emphasized the importance of physical activity and outdoor play for children. She mentioned that her family enjoys going on hikes and exploring the outdoors. This is important because studies have shown that regular physical activity can improve children's physical and mental health, as well as their academic performance.</p>
