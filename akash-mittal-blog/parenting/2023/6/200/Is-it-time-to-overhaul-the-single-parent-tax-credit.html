  <p>As a single mother of two school-going children, Amy finds it hard to make ends meet. Juggling work and parenting duties, she barely manages to pay rent, groceries and utility bills. She is thankful for the government's child tax credit, which she receives annually, but feels that the system is outdated and flawed.</p>
  <p>Amy is not alone. Several advocacy groups have called for an overhaul of the 'antiquated' single parent tax credit that 'ignores' shared parenting progress. The credit was introduced in the early 2000s, when single parents were only entitled to benefits if they had full custody of their children. However, as family structures have evolved and more parents have chosen to co-parent, the tax credit has failed to meet the needs of many single parents and their families.</p>
  <h2>The current system</h2>
  <p>The single parent tax credit is a form of child tax credit that is available to parents who have the sole responsibility for at least one child. It is designed to increase the income of single parents and help them to manage the costs of raising their children.</p>
  <p>However, the system has some significant flaws. Currently, the credit is only available to the lead parent, meaning that the other parent cannot claim it, even if they are sharing equal parenting responsibilities. This puts a strain on many co-parenting families, where both parents are contributing equally to the care of their children, but only one can receive the credit.</p>
  <p>Amy knows this all too well. Despite sharing custody equally with her former partner, she is the only one who can claim the tax credit. "It's not fair that I get the credit and he doesn't," she says. "We both put in the same amount of effort to raise our children, but I'm the only one who gets financial support."</p>
  <h2>The case for change</h2>
  <p>Several advocacy groups are calling for the government to overhaul the single parent tax credit to make it more inclusive of modern family structures. They argue that the current system is unfair and fails to reflect the reality of many co-parenting families.</p>
  <p>One of the main arguments for change is that the credit should be available to both parents, regardless of who has primary custody. This would better reflect the reality of many families, where both parents are actively involved in their children's lives and contribute equally to their care.</p>
  <p>Another argument for change is that the credit should be based on the actual cost of raising a child, rather than assuming that one parent is solely responsible for the child's care. Currently, the credit is a set amount per child, regardless of the actual cost of raising that child. This can be problematic for families where one parent earns significantly less than the other, as the credit may not cover the full cost of raising the child.</p>
  <h2>The impact of change</h2>
  <p>If the government were to overhaul the single parent tax credit, it could have a significant impact on many families. Here are three ways that change could benefit co-parenting families:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Increased financial support for families who share parenting duties equally</li>
   <li>More accurate reflection of the true cost of raising a child</li>
   <li>More inclusivity for non-traditional family structures</li>
  </ol>
  <p>However, it's important to note that any changes to the system would need to be carefully considered to avoid unintended consequences. For example, some have raised concerns that allowing both parents to claim the tax credit could create an incentive for parents to fight for sole custody, rather than sharing parenting responsibilities equally.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The single parent tax credit is a valuable form of financial support for many families, but it is clear that the current system has significant flaws. By making the credit more inclusive of modern family structures and the actual costs of raising a child, the government could better support co-parenting families and improve the lives of single parents and their children.</p>
  <p>If you are a single parent struggling to make ends meet, there are some practical tips that may help. Consider seeking out community resources, such as food banks and childcare assistance programs. Look for ways to reduce your monthly expenses, such as by cutting back on unnecessary subscriptions or negotiating bills. And don't be afraid to seek out support from family and friends.</p>
