    <p>It's not every day that you hear a famous athlete joke about their "bad parenting", and yet that's exactly what happened when Tom Brady recently let his children jump off a yacht. It all went down during a family vacation in Costa Rica, where Brady and his wife Gisele BÃ¼ndchen were spending time with their children and close friends. As their kids, Jack, Benjamin, and Vivian, repeatedly jumped off the boat, Brady captured the moment on his Instagram stories, making sure to add a humorous commentary about his "bad parenting" for all his followers to see.</p>

    <p>While it may seem like a harmless and fun activity for children, jumping off a yacht can actually be quite dangerous. According to the United States Coast Guard, falls overboard are the leading cause of boating fatalities on open waters. In fact, just last year there were 613 reported incidents of deaths or injuries due to falls overboard.</p>
    <p>That being said, it's important to note that the Brady family's yacht was most likely anchored in relatively calm and shallow waters, and that Brady himself is a seasoned boater. Nevertheless, it's still a good idea for parents to be mindful of the potential risks involved when letting their children play in and around water. It's always better to err on the side of caution and take extra safety precautions.</p>
