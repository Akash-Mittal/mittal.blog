  <p>As Season Two of the hit show "Cruel Summer" approaches, fans are eagerly anticipating what's next for the characters they've come to love. But something else that's caught their attention is the show's use of Y2K fashion and aesthetics, which have made a comeback in recent years.</p>
  <p>Actress Lexi Underwood, who plays one of the lead roles in the show, has fully embraced the Y2K aesthetic for her character's wardrobe. From butterfly hair clips to low-rise jeans, her outfits are a nod to the early 2000s and everything that came with it.</p>
  <p>So, what exactly is the Y2K aesthetic? It's a fashion and design style that emerged in the late 1990s and early 2000s, characterized by bright colors, bold patterns, and a mix of futuristic and retro elements. Think glittery makeup, platform sneakers, and glittery cellphone cases.</p>
  <p>Here are some examples of how you can incorporate the Y2K aesthetic into your own style:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Go for bold colors and patterns. Don't be afraid to mix and match different patterns and colors, such as leopard print and neon pink.</li>
   <li>Accessorize with butterfly clips, glittery hair ties, and beaded bracelets. These were all popular Y2K accessories that are making a comeback.</li>
   <li>Invest in some low-rise jeans or mini skirts. These were a staple of early 2000s fashion and look great with crop tops or bandeaus.</li>
  </ul>
