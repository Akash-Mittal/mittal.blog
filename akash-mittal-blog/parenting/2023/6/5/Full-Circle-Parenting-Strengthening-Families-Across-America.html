   <h2>Practical Tips for Parents</h2>
   <p>Here are some practical tips that parents can use to strengthen their families:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Take time to connect with your children on a regular basis. Whether it's a game night, a bike ride, or just a chat before bedtime, make sure to carve out time to spend with your children and let them know they are loved and valued.</li>
    <li>Practice active listening. When your children talk to you, really listen to what they are saying. Ask questions, repeat back what you've heard, and show that you are interested in their thoughts and feelings.</li>
    <li>Set clear boundaries and consequences for behavior. Children thrive when they know what is expected of them and what will happen if they break the rules. Be consistent in enforcing boundaries and consequences, and make sure your expectations are age-appropriate.</li>
