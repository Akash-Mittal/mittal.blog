   <p>The famous American actress Mayim Bialik, who is best known for her role as Amy Farrah Fowler on the hit sitcom The Big Bang Theory, recently received a check from The View after they criticized her parenting style.</p>
   <p>During a segment of the show, the hosts discussed Bialik's controversial parenting book, Beyond the Sling, which promotes attachment parenting. They criticized Bialik for her parenting choices and made several negative comments about her book.</p>
   <p>Bialik, who is a mother of two and holds a Ph.D. in neuroscience, was not pleased with the criticism and took to social media to voice her disappointment. She urged the hosts to do their research before commenting on her book.</p>
   <p>In response, The View sent Bialik a check for the amount she would have earned if she had appeared on the show as a guest. Bialik took to social media once again to thank The View for their gesture and to reiterate the importance of doing research before commenting on parenting styles.</p>
   <h2> Criticism</h2>
   <p>The hosts of The View made several negative comments about Bialik's parenting style during the segment. Some of the most notable examples include:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>"I can't with this attachment parenting. I think it's weird." - Joy Behar</li>
    <li>"There's something about it that creeps me out." - Sherri Shepherd</li>
    <li>"You're going to raise wimpy kids who can't deal with the real world." - Elisabeth Hasselbeck</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, Mayim Bialik's experience with The View serves as a reminder that parenting styles are a personal choice, and everyone has the right to make their own decisions when it comes to raising their children. It's important for people to do their research before criticizing or commenting on someone else's parenting choices.</p>
   <p>Here are three key takeaways from Bialik's experience:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Respect other people's parenting choices, even if they are different from your own.</li>
    <li>Do your research before commenting on parenting styles or books.</li>
    <li>Remember that every parent is doing the best they can with the knowledge and resources they have available.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2> and Practical Tips</h2>
   <p>As a mother of two young children myself, I can relate to Bialik's experience. I have often felt judged or criticized for my parenting choices, especially when it comes to topics like breastfeeding, co-sleeping, and discipline.</p>
   <p>Here are a few practical tips for parents who may be experiencing similar challenges:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Surround yourself with supportive people who respect your parenting choices.</li>
    <li>Do your own research and make informed decisions about what works best for you and your family.</li>
