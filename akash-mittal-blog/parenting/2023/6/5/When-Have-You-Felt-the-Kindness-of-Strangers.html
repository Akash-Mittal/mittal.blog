    <h2>The Power of Kindness from Strangers</h2>
    <p>It was a freezing winter night in Manhattan. I was walking home from work, huddled in my coat, when suddenly a gust of wind blew my hat off my head. I watched in horror as it flew away and landed in a slushy puddle on the side of the road. Defeated, I trudged over to retrieve it, but before I could, a man stopped his car and jumped out. He handed me my hat with a smile and a simple, "Stay warm, miss." That small act of kindness from a stranger made my entire day.</p>
