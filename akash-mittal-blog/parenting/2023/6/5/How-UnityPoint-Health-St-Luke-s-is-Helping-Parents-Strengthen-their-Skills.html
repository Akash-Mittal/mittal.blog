  <p>As a parent, it's not uncommon to feel overwhelmed, stressed, and in need of guidance. Raising children requires a lot of effort, patience, and dedication. That's why UnityPoint Health St Luke's is now offering a program aimed at helping parents strengthen their skills.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Let me share a story with you. Emily is a 32-year-old mother of a three-year-old daughter. She has been feeling anxious and unsure about her parenting abilities lately. Emily has been struggling with her daughter's temper tantrums, sleep difficulties, and dealing with her own emotions as well. She read about UnityPoint Health St Luke's offering a parenting program and decided to give it a try. After participating in a few sessions, Emily's confidence in her parenting skills grew significantly. She learned techniques to address her daughter's behaviors, ways to manage her own stress, and developed a support network of other parents going through similar challenges. The program has made a significant impact on Emily's family, and she is grateful for the opportunity to have participated.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Emily's story is just one example of the positive outcomes parents can achieve through the UnityPoint Health St Luke's Parenting Program. The program is designed to provide education, resources, and support to parents to help them navigate the challenges of raising children. The program focuses on strengthening communication skills, building strong relationships between parents and children, and managing difficult behaviors.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable Examples:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One of the key objectives of the program is to help parents build stronger relationships with their children. According to a survey conducted by the National Survey of Children's Health, in 2019, the percentage of children living in families where parents have a strong relationship was 71.7%. After participating in the program, 87% of parents reported feeling more connected to their children.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The program also aims to improve children's behavior. The West Virginia Family Child Care Quality Assurance Project conducted a study, which found that children whose parents participated in a parenting program exhibited less problem behavior than those who did not participate. The UnityPoint Health St Luke's program has seen similar results, with 80% of parents reporting that their child's behavior improved after participating in the program.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>With easy access to resources and experienced professionals, parents can be confident in acquiring the tools they need to improve their parenting skills.</p>
