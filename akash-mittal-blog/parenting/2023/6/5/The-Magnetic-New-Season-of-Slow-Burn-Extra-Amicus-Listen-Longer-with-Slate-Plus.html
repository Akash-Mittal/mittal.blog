   <p>A couple of years ago, I started listening to podcasts on my daily commute to work. I had heard about a new show called Slow Burn and decided to give it a try. The first season was about the Watergate scandal, and I was immediately hooked. It was like a real-life political thriller that I couldn't stop listening to.</p>
   <p>When I heard that Slow Burn was coming back for a new season, I was excited to see what they would cover next. The show's host, Leon Neyfakh, had teased that this season would be different from the first two, and would focus on something that had been overlooked in the past. As a Slate Plus member, I had early access to the new season, and I have to say, it did not disappoint.</p>
   <p>This season of Slow Burn is all about the infamous Tupac and Biggie murders that shook the world in the 1990s. Neyfakh takes a deep dive into this complicated and often confusing case, looking at the history of hip hop, the rivalry between the two rappers, and the shady characters surrounding them. It's a fascinating and incredibly detailed look at one of the biggest mysteries in music history.</p>
   <p>What makes this season even more exciting is the addition of a new show called Amicus Listen Longer. Hosted by Slate legal correspondent Dahlia Lithwick, this new show takes a closer look at the legal issues surrounding the Tupac and Biggie murders. Using interviews, expert analysis, and candid conversations, Lithwick and her guests break down complex legal concepts and make them accessible to the layperson.</p>
   <p>As a data scientist, I love numbers, and in this new season, I was pleasantly surprised to see plenty of quantifiable examples. Neyfakh and Lithwick use data and statistics to paint a clearer picture of what happened leading up to the Tupac and Biggie shootings. They rely on numbers to show the extent of the violence that was happening in the music industry at the time, and how the police failed to solve the case for over two decades. It's a powerful way to make their case, and it's one of the things that makes this season so compelling.</p>
   <p>Listening to this new season, I couldn't help but think about my own life. I grew up in the 90s, and I remember the shockwaves that went through the music industry after Tupac and Biggie were killed. It's strange to think that I'm now old enough to hear a podcast that looks back on that time with a critical eye. This new season is a great reminder that history is constantly repeating itself, and the past will always be with us in some way.</p>
