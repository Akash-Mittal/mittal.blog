  <h1>The Day I Skipped My Own Graduation Party</h1> <img src="images/Praise-as-Woman-Tells-Truth-About-Why-She-Skipped-Her-Own-Graduation-Party.jpeg" alt="+Praise-as-Woman-Tells-Truth-About-Why-She-Skipped-Her-Own-Graduation-Party+">
  <p>It was the day of my graduation party and I was nowhere to be found. My family and friends had all gathered to celebrate my achievements and to congratulate me on my graduation. However, I chose not to attend the party.</p>
  <p>When I informed my family that I would not be attending my graduation party, they were taken aback. They could not understand why I would want to skip such an important event in my life. However, I had my reasons.</p>
  <h2>The Pressure of Society</h2>
  <p>Throughout my academic journey, I had felt the pressure to perform well and to achieve great things. Society had set certain standards that I felt I had to meet in order to be considered successful. However, when I finally graduated, I realized that those standards didn't really matter.</p>
  <p>Growing up, I had always been told that if I worked hard enough and got good grades, I would be able to get a good job and be successful. However, after graduating, I realized that this was not entirely true. Getting good grades and having a degree did not guarantee success.</p>
  <p>I felt like society had put too much emphasis on academic achievements, and that it didn't take into account the hard work and dedication it takes to succeed in life. I realized that I didn't want to be defined by my academic achievements, and that there was more to life than just getting good grades.</p>
  <h2>The Need to Define Success on My Own Terms</h2>
  <p>As I approached graduation, I started to question what success really meant to me. Did it mean getting a high-paying job and climbing the corporate ladder? Did it mean having a certain title or level of education? After some soul searching, I realized that success meant something different to me than it did to society.</p>
  <p>I wanted to define my own version of success, and that didn't necessarily involve following the traditional path that society had laid out for me. I wanted to pursue my passions and do something that I loved, even if it didn't fit into the traditional definition of success.</p>
  <p>I didn't want to be defined by my degree or by my job title. I wanted to be defined by my actions and by the impact that I had on the world.</p>
  <h2>The Importance of Mental Health</h2>
  <p>Throughout my academic journey, I had also struggled with mental health issues. There were times when I had pushed myself too hard and had neglected my own well-being in order to meet society's expectations.</p>
  <p>As I approached graduation, I realized that my mental health was more important than any degree or academic achievement. I needed to take care of myself first and foremost, in order to be able to pursue my passions and make a positive impact on the world.</p>
  <p>I knew that attending my graduation party would have been a stressful experience for me, and that it would have taken a toll on my mental health. So, I chose to prioritize my well-being over attendance at the party.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In skipping my own graduation party, I made a decision that was difficult for my family and friends to understand. However, it was a decision that was necessary for me to define success on my own terms, to prioritize my mental health, and to push back against the pressure of society.</p>
  <ol>
   <li>It's important to define success on your own terms, rather than letting society dictate what success means to you.</li>
   <li>Taking care of your mental health should always be a priority, even if it means making difficult decisions.</li>
   <li>Push back against societal pressure and pursue your passions, even if they don't fit into the traditional definition of success.</li>
  </ol>
