    <p>It was a sunny day in May, and I had just completed my Master's degree. My family and friends were all excited to attend my graduation party, but I didn't share their enthusiasm. I just couldn't bring myself to celebrate.</p>
    <p>As the day approached, I became increasingly anxious. I felt like a fraud, like I didn't deserve to be there. Despite the kind messages from loved ones, I couldn't shake off this feeling of self-doubt and inadequacy.</p>
    <p>So, I made a decision that surprised many: I skipped my own graduation party.</p>

   <section id="quantifiable-examples">
    <p>If you're reading this, you might be thinking I overreacted or that I was just being dramatic. However, what you may not know is that many people experience similar feelings of self-doubt and anxiety during significant milestones, such as graduations.</p>
    <p>Here are some quantifiable examples:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>According to a survey by the American Psychological Association, more than 40% of adults report feeling anxious about personal safety or the well-being of loved ones.</li>
     <li>Another study published in the Journal of Anxiety Disorders found that up to 25% of individuals experience anxiety during major life transitions, such as graduations.</li>
     <li>Even more concerning, a study by the National Institute of Mental Health found that anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the US, affecting 40 million adults, or 18.1% of the population.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These numbers only scratch the surface of the complex emotions that individuals can experience during significant milestones.</p>
   </section>
   <section id="personal-anecdotes">
    <p>My decision to skip my graduation party was not an easy one. In fact, I felt a sense of guilt and shame for not attending. However, for me, it was crucial to prioritize my mental health and self-care.</p>
    <p>Through my own experience and conversations with others, I've come to learn that everyone's response to major life events is unique and valid.</p>
    <ul>
     <li>A friend of mine skipped her graduation party because she had recently lost a loved one and couldn't bear to celebrate without them.</li>
     <li>Another friend chose to have a small gathering with close friends and family, rather than a big party, because she felt overwhelmed by the thought of hosting and entertaining people.</li>
     <li>A family member decided not to attend their graduation ceremony because they had already secured a job and felt that the ceremony was simply a formality.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are just a few examples of how individuals may choose to respond to significant milestones based on their unique circumstances and experiences.</p>
   </section>
   <section id="tips">
    <p>If you are struggling with feelings of self-doubt or anxiety during a major life event, there are several things you can do to prioritize your mental health and well-being:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Seek professional help: Consider talking to a therapist or counselor to help you navigate your emotions and develop coping strategies.</li>
     <li>Practice self-care: Make time for activities that bring you joy and relaxation. This can include exercise, hobbies, or spending time with loved ones.</li>
     <li>Set boundaries: Don't feel pressured to attend events or do things that don't align with your values or priorities. It's okay to say no and prioritize your well-being.</li>
     <li>Focus on your accomplishments: Rather than focusing on the negative thoughts and self-doubt, celebrate your achievements and progress. Journaling or sharing your accomplishments with a supportive friend or family member can help reinforce positive thinking.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Remember, self-care and prioritizing your well-being is not selfish; it's necessary for leading a healthy and fulfilling life.</p>
