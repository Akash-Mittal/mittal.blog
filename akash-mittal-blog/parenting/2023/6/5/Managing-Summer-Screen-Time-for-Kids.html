   <h3>A Parenting Pro Guide to Keeping Your Kids Productive</h3>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>Summer fun is in full swing, but so are the digital distractions. With long days and endless free time, it can be tough to keep kids from spending all day in front of a screen. As a parenting pro, I have seen the negative impact of excessive screen time first-hand, and I am here to share my top tips for managing summer screen time in a way that keeps your kids engaged and productive.</p>
   <section>
    <h2>A Real-Life Example</h2>
    <p>One of my clients, a single mom of two, came to me at the start of the summer with a concern. "My kids spend all day on their devices," she said. "They hardly go outside or do anything else." She wanted to make sure her kids weren't wasting their summer, but she also didn't want to resort to being a strict enforcer. Together, we came up with a plan that worked for her family.</p>

     <li>On average, American kids spend over 7 hours per day looking at screens</li>
     <li>Over 80% of kids have their own smartphones by age 13</li>
     <li>Studies have shown that excessive screen time can lead to obesity, poor sleep, and lower academic performance</li>

    <h2>3 Tips for Managing Summer Screen Time</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>Set boundaries: Establish clear rules around screen time, and stick to them. For example, you may decide that screens are only allowed after a certain time of day, or for a limited amount of time each day. Encourage your kids to find other activities they enjoy, whether it's reading, drawing, or playing outside.</li>
     <li>Lead by example: As a parent, it's important to model the behavior you want to see in your kids. If you are constantly on your own phone or tablet, it will be harder to get your kids to disconnect. Make a conscious effort to unplug and engage in family activities.</li>
     <li>Offer alternatives: Finally, provide your kids with alternatives to screen time. Plan family outings, enroll them in summer programs, or simply encourage them to try new hobbies. The more fun and engaging activities you can offer, the less likely they will be to default to their devices.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>One summer, I noticed that my own kids were spending way too much time indoors, glued to their screens. I knew I needed to take action, so I scheduled a family meeting to discuss our screen time rules. We set a limit of 2 hours per day, and we brainstormed a list of fun activities we could do together as a family. We went on hikes, visited the local pool, and even started a garden! By the end of the summer, my kids were more active and engaged than ever, and I felt like we had really bonded as a family.</p>

    <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>Use apps to monitor and control your kids' screen time, like <a href="https://www.comparedth.com/monitor-kids-screen-time/" target="_blank">Screen Time</a> or <a href="https://www.norton.com/kids-privacy" target="_blank">Norton Family</a>.</li>
     <li>Limit exposure to social media, which can be a major time-suck and contributor to cyberbullying and mental health problems.</li>
     <li>Encourage your kids to read for fun, and provide a variety of age-appropriate books to choose from.</li>
     <li>Make screen-free time a regular part of your family's routine, like during meals or before bedtime.</li>
