   <p>In my years of experience as a family law attorney, I've seen numerous cases where a cookie cutter 50/50 custody arrangement simply doesn't work for the families involved. One such case involved a little girl who was adamant about spending more time with her father, but the mother was pushing for a strict 50/50 split. As a result, the girl felt torn between her parents and was dealing with a lot of emotional distress.</p>
   <p>While the idea of equal time for each parent may seem fair on the surface, there are a number of factors that can make this arrangement impractical or even harmful to a child's well-being. Here are some examples:</p>
   <ul><!-- include at least three quantifiable examples here -->
    <li>Logistics: If one parent lives far away from the child's school or activities, it can be difficult to achieve a 50/50 schedule without causing disruptions or putting undue stress on the child.</li>
    <li>Parental Conflict: In cases where parents have a high level of conflict or communication issues, a 50/50 arrangement may not be healthy for the child to be around. This can be especially true if there is a history of traumas such as domestic violence.</li>
    <li>Child's Preferences: Parents should pay attention to their children's desires and comfort levels when it comes to a parenting plan. In some cases, a child may prefer to spend more time with one parent over the other, or may feel uncomfortable with switching back and forth between homes frequently.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Given these factors, it's clear that a one-size-fits-all approach to custody arrangements simply isn't practical or effective. Instead, parents should work with their attorneys and family court professionals to create a personalized plan that takes into account the unique needs of their family.</p><!-- include personal anecdotes or case studies here -->
   <p>One case that illustrates this point involved a mother who was struggling with addiction and unable to provide a stable home for her children. Despite this, the father was insistent on a 50/50 custody split. After much negotiation and advocacy on the part of the mother's attorney and a child welfare professional, it was determined that a supervised visitation schedule would be the safest and most appropriate option for the children.</p>
   <p>Another case involved a father who worked night shifts and was concerned about being able to spend quality time with his children while maintaining his work schedule. With the help of his attorney and a custody evaluator, he was able to create a custom arrangement that allowed for more time with the children on his days off, without disrupting their school or extracurricular activities.</p><!-- provide practical tips for readers here -->
