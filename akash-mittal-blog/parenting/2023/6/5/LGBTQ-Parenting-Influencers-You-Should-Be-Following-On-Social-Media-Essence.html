     <p>When Sarah and her partner, Maria, decided to start a family, they faced some challenges due to their LGBTQ status.

They also knew they would have to deal with some misconceptions and stigma once their child was born.</p>
     <p>However, Sarah and Maria found strength and support through the LGBTQ parenting community on social media. Through various platforms, they connected with other LGBTQ parents, shared their experiences, and learned about resources and tips that helped them navigate the parenting journey.</p>
