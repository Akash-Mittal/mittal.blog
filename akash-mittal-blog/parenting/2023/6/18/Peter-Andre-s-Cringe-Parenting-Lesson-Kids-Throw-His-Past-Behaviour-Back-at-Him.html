    <p>This is the cringe-worthy moment that Peter Andre experienced when his kids threw his past behaviour back at him. It's a reminder that when it comes to parenting, sometimes the best lessons are learned by example rather than by words.</p>
    <p>Parenting is hard and there's no right way to do it. However, as a public figure with a high profile, Peter Andre's experience is harrowing yet relatable. The following are some tips that parents can consider in their parenting journey.</p>

    <h2>Examples of Quantifiable Lessons Learned</h2>
    <ol>
     <li><strong>Promote Good Behaviour:</strong> When you promote good behaviour, such as being polite and respectful, your children will most likely mirror these behaviours to the best of their abilities. This could mean rewarding their good behaviour with something like a sweet treat or simply giving them acknowledgment. Peter Andre discovered that promoting good behaviour can help to create a positive environment for your children.</li>
     <li><strong>Don't Strive for Perfection:</strong> It's easy to get caught up in trying to be the perfect parent, but your children will make mistakes and so will you! Accept that you're going to make mistakes, and don't beat yourself up about it. Peter Andre learned this lesson when his kids reminded him of his past behaviour.</li>
     <li><strong>Model the Behaviour You Want to See:</strong> This is perhaps the most important lesson of all. Your children will watch, listen, and learn from you. If you want them to be honest, respectful, and kind, then you need to make sure that you're displaying those behaviours to them as well. Peter Andre learned the hard way that modelling the behaviour you want to see is important for both parenting and being a public figure.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Parents</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>Be consistent. Consistency is key to raising well-behaved children. If you're inconsistent in your parenting methods, then your kids will be confused and not know what to expect.</li>
     <li>Communicate. Keep an open line of communication with your children. Listen to their thoughts and concerns and let them express their feelings without judgement.</li>
     <li>Make Time for Fun. Don't always be serious as a parent. Make time for fun activities that you can enjoy with your children, like playing games, going on outings, or watching movies.</li>
     <li>Don't be afraid to ask for help. Parenting is hard, and it's okay to ask for help when you need it. Whether it's from a friend, family member, or a professional, don't be afraid to reach out.</li>
    </ul>
