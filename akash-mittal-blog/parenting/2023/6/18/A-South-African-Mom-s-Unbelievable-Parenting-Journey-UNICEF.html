    <h2>The Struggles of a Single Mom</h2>
    <p>As a single mother in South Africa, Thandiwe faced numerous challenges in raising her children. She had to work long hours just to provide for her family, often leaving her kids alone at home. They would spend most of their days watching TV or playing outside without much supervision.</p>
    <p>One day, Thandiwe came across a UNICEF program that aimed to help single mothers like her. She was hesitant at first, feeling embarrassed and like a failure for needing help. But she decided to give it a try.</p>
    <h2>The Impact of UNICEF's Program</h2>
    <p>UNICEF's program provided Thandiwe with the support and resources she needed to become a better parent. She learned how to set boundaries and rules for her children, and how to communicate with them effectively. She also learned how to manage her finances and plan for the future.</p>
    <p>With the program's help, Thandiwe was able to provide a stable and healthy environment for her children. They started doing better in school and were more well-behaved at home. Thandiwe also found a community of other single mothers who she could relate to and seek advice from.</p>
    <h2> Success</h2>
    <p>The impact of UNICEF's program on Thandiwe and her family is clear. Here are some quantifiable examples:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Thandiwe's income increased by 25% within a year of starting the program.</li>
     <li>Thandiwe's children had a 30% increase in school attendance and a 20% increase in grades.</li>
     <li>The number of fights between Thandiwe and her children decreased by 40%.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, UNICEF's program had a tremendous impact on Thandiwe and her family. Thanks to the program, Thandiwe was able to become a better parent and provide a more stable environment for her children. Here are three key takeaways from Thandiwe's story:</p>
    <ol>

     <li>Parenting is hard, but with the right support, it can be easier.</li>
