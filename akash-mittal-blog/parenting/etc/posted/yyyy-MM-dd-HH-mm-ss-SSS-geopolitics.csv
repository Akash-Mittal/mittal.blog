This comes in the wake of the EU's decision to impose sanctions on some Chinese entities over alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang.
The Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said that such moves were based on ""biased"" and ""false"" information, and urged the EU to ""stop interfering in China's internal affairs"". He also warned that any attempt to impose sanctions without evidence would be counterproductive and damage the relationship between the two sides.
The EU, meanwhile, has said that it is considering sanctions against Chinese entities that it believes are involved in cyber attacks, as well as those who have violated human rights in Hong Kong and Taiwan.

From plastic bags to straws to microplastics in our food and water, the impact of single-use plastics on our environment and health is undeniable. However, progress towards a plastic-free planet has been slow, and on day 1 of the Paris meet, geopolitical challenges have emerged as a major obstacle to success.
On day 1 of the Paris meet, representatives from around the world gathered to discuss ways to reduce plastic pollution and protect our planet. However, geopolitical tensions quickly emerged as a major obstacle to progress.
Many countries, particularly those in the developing world, are dependent on the export of plastic waste to other countries for recycling. However, a recent decision by China to ban the import of plastic waste has left many of these countries scrambling to find alternative markets. This has created a bottleneck in the recycling process, further exacerbating the plastic pollution crisis.
In addition, some of the world's biggest polluters, such as the United States, have refused to sign onto international agreements aimed at reducing plastic pollution. This has created a situation where countries that are taking action to address the issue are seeing little progress because of the actions of a few.
Despite the geopolitical challenges, there are still many things that individuals and communities can do to reduce plastic pollution:
