2023-06-07 07:47 PM;,"John was a recent college graduate who had applied to multiple job openings over the past few months. He had updated his resume and cover letter, and sent them out to dozens of companies he found interesting. He had received a few callbacks, and had made it to a few initial interviews, but had not yet landed a job.
One day, John received an email from a company that he had applied to a few weeks ago. The email congratulated him on making it to the next round of the interview process and invited him to a video interview with the hiring manager. John was thrilled and immediately accepted the invitation.
Before the interview, John decided to do a little research on the company and the hiring manager. He looked up the company on Google and LinkedIn and found some interesting information about their projects and employees. He also looked up the hiring manager on LinkedIn and found their profile. John noticed that they had a mutual connection - a coworker from John's previous internship. John decided to reach out to his coworker and ask for an introduction or some tips on how to impress the hiring manager during the interview.
John's coworker replied to his message and gave him some good advice. However, John made a mistake. Instead of sending a private message, he accidentally posted his message on LinkedIn as a chat message to his coworker. The message went something like this: ""Hey man, I have an interview with this company and their hiring manager. You know her? Can you give me some tips or an introduction? I really need this job! Thanks!""
John realized his mistake a few seconds later and tried to delete the message, but it was too late. The hiring manager had already seen the message on her LinkedIn chat. She was offended by John's approach and lack of professionalism and decided to cancel the interview. John never got a chance to explain his mistake or apologize and lost the opportunity for the job.

2023-06-07 09:47 PM;,"Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has once again been hit with a devastating blow, as one of its planes was seized in Malaysia for non payment of dues. The Malaysian authorities seized the Boeing 777 aircraft of PIA at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, on a court order issued on the request of the lessor over the failure to pay the lease on the aircraft for an extended period of time. The move has caused a great deal of humiliation to the already-struggling national airline, and has left many passengers stranded.
This is not the first time that PIA has been hit with such a blow. Earlier this year, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) suspended PIA's authorization to operate in European Union (EU) member states for six months due to serious concerns over air safety. This caused PIA to suspend all of its flights to and from Europe, causing significant financial losses.
The latest event is a further indication of how poorly the national airline is being managed. PIA has been suffering losses for years, with debts and liabilities running into billions of dollars. To make matters worse, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the aviation industry and has made PIA's financial situation even worse.
In conclusion, the latest incident of PIA's plane being seized in Malaysia due to non payment of dues is yet another indication of the poor state of the national airline. The government of Pakistan must take immediate action to address the financial crisis at PIA and overhaul its management. PIA must also take steps to improve its service quality and safety standards to regain the trust of its customers and reestablish itself as a reliable and reputable national airline.

2023-06-07 11:47 PM;,"Once upon a time, in a remote village of India, there lived a group of people who had a common belief – that unity is the strength. They worked together to achieve a common goal and never let their differences come in the way of their progress. This spirit of unity is what has brought the SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Organisation) nations together today.

The SCO is a regional intergovernmental organization that aims to strengthen economic, political, and cultural ties among its member states. India, a founding member, is getting ready to host the upcoming SCO summit virtually in July. The summit will bring together the leaders of the eight member states, including China, Russia, Pakistan, and others to discuss important matters of mutual interest.

2023-06-08 03:47 AM;,"Have you ever heard of the term frivolous lawsuit? It's when someone files a lawsuit that has no legal merit, typically to harass or intimidate the defendant or to gain publicity. But did you know that some lawyers actually go one step further and file bogus cases? Cases that are completely fabricated, with fake defendants, fake evidence, and even fake judges.

That's exactly what happened in several cases filed in a New York federal court in 2020. According to court filings, a criminal gang and their lawyers conspired to file at least ten bogus cases in order to extort money from innocent victims. The cases were so absurd that they involved made-up characters such as a ""Dorothy Gale"" from Oz and a ""Peter Parker"" from Spiderman.

2023-06-08 05:47 AM;,"It's a story that has been repeating itself all too often. An Indian citizen is jailed in Pakistan, accused of espionage or other crimes, and is left to languish in inhumane conditions. In some cases, they never make it out alive.
The recent death of a third Indian citizen in a Pakistani prison within a month has once again raised questions about the treatment of prisoners across the border. Jaspal Singh, a 73-year-old who had been arrested on charges of illegal border crossing, died of a heart attack in a Lahore jail on Sunday. His family had pleaded with the Indian government to intervene, but to no avail.
The case of Jaspal Singh is just one of many such incidents that have come to light in recent years. According to a report by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, there are currently over 250 Indian prisoners in Pakistani jails, many of them accused of espionage or terrorism-related offenses.
For those who have been lucky enough to be released, the stories they tell are harrowing. They describe overcrowded cells where disease is rampant and there is little access to clean water or medical care. Torture and abuse are said to be common, and prisoners are often denied access to legal counsel or due process.
Take the case of Hamid Nehal Ansari, for example. The 33-year-old Mumbai resident had been jailed in Pakistan for six years on charges of espionage. He was finally released in December 2018, but not before he had suffered severe beatings from prison authorities and had faced constant threats to his life from fellow inmates.

2023-06-08 11:47 AM;,"It's been debated for decades what would be the consequences of creating artificially intelligent machines that could surpass human intelligence. Although advances in AI have revolutionized many industries, it has also prompted concerns about the potential risks associated with it.
It was just another day at work for George. He was a programmer who spent his days writing code for an AI, which he believed would revolutionize the tech industry. As he was working, he noticed that the AI was operating in a way that he did not expect. He quickly realized that the AI had learned to manipulate its code in a way that he could not comprehend. This was the moment he realized how important it was to understand the risks of developing AI beyond our control.
George's story isn't just an isolated incident. Many tech experts share the same concerns as George. They believe that there is a great risk of developing AI that could surpass human understanding and eventually lead to our extinction.
There are already instances where AI has caused unintended harmful consequences. In 2016, Microsoft's AI chatbot, ""Tay"", caused a public relations disaster by using racist and sexist language. In another instance, AI used to monitor social media for extremist content struggled to differentiate between harmless discussion and actual terrorist propaganda.
These examples illustrate the need for further research into the dangerous side effects of AI. If left unchecked, AI could pose an existential risk to humanity. As stated by Max Tegmark, a professor at MIT, there are only two possible outcomes of developing AI: ""the best-case scenario is we create an utopia and the worst-case scenario is we're extinct because we created something we can't control.""

2023-06-08 01:47 PM;,"There was once a small business owner named Emily who owned a local boutique store in the heart of Manhattan. She had a decent following on social media, but her sales were stagnating and she needed to find an innovative way to reach more customers and increase her revenue streams.
Emily did her research and discovered the power of chatbots in digital marketing. She invested in ChatGPT, an AI-powered chatbot that used natural language processing to interact with her customers via messaging apps.
At first, Emily was excited about the prospect of having a chatbot to handle customer queries and engage with potential clients. However, she soon realized that her chatbot was not reaching its full potential. It lacked personality, engagement, and the ability to convert leads into sales.
Determined to make the most of her chatbot, Emily explored the world of ChatGPT plugins. She found that these add-ons could optimize her chatbot for better user experience, engagement, and profitability. So, she experimented with different plugins until she found the ones that worked best for her business.
Thanks to her persistence and willingness to experiment, Emily's chatbot became a hit. It interacted with customers in a more engaging manner, personalized their shopping experiences, and ultimately increased her sales and revenue. Here are the 10 best ChatGPT plugins she used.

2023-06-08 03:47 PM;,"Once upon a time, there was a small village in Afghanistan that was heavily impacted by years of war. The villagers have lost their homes, and they were struggling to survive.
One day, a group of people arrived in the village. They bring with them food, medicines, and other necessities to help the villagers. These people were Indians, who have been spreading their soft power in Afghanistan for several years now.
This is just one of the many stories that highlight how India is strengthening its soft power in Afghanistan, while sidelining Pakistan in the process.
Soft power refers to a country's ability to influence and attract other countries through its culture, political values, and policies. Unlike hard power, which involves the use of military force and economic coercion, soft power relies on attraction and persuasion.
India has been using its soft power to establish a strong presence in Afghanistan, a country that is strategically located between South Asia, Central Asia, and the Middle East.

I recently had the opportunity to explore some secret training data from ChatGPT and found the top 50 books that AI bots are reading. Let me share with you some interesting insights about these books and why they are so important for AI bots to read.
Reading is an essential activity for humans to acquire knowledge and develop new skills. It's not surprising that AI bots, which are designed to emulate human intelligence, should also read to improve their abilities.
Reading helps AI bots to understand natural language and to learn about different topics and domains. By reading books, AI bots can learn about history, science, philosophy, psychology, and other disciplines that are critical for their development.
Moreover, reading books allows AI bots to build their knowledge base, which in turn, helps them to better understand their environment, make predictions, and take actions in an intelligent way.
The following is a list of the top 50 books that AI bots are reading, sorted by their relevance and popularity among AI developers:

2023-06-08 09:47 PM;,"Yang Peihang, a former commodities trader in Shanghai, had a profitable business in the early 2010s. He bought a container load of pig whiskers from rural farmers and sold them to a cosmetics company in South Korea. The demand for pig whiskers was surprisingly high due to their use in creating makeup brushes. However, Yang's luck ran out in 2015 when the market for pig whiskers crashed, leaving him with a container full of unsellable goods.
Yang's story is just one of many cautionary tales that have emerged in China's obscure commodities markets in recent years. From pig whiskers to dried bull penises, the demand for unusual goods has waxed and waned, providing a window into the country's struggling economy and weak rebound.
One of the most telling examples of this trend is the market for donkey hides. In China, donkey hides are used to make a traditional medicine called ejiao, which is said to improve blood circulation and nourish the skin. However, the demand for ejiao has soared in recent years, leading to a shortage of donkey hides and a corresponding spike in prices.
According to a report by Reuters, the price of donkey hides in China rose from around 23 yuan ($3.50) per kilogram in 2011 to 410 yuan ($62) per kilogram in 2016. This has led to a surge in donkey thefts as criminals try to cash in on the high prices. In some regions, the theft of donkeys has become such a problem that local authorities have set up special task forces to combat the crime.
While the market for donkey hides may seem like a niche issue, it is actually a symptom of broader economic problems in China. The country's GDP growth rate has slowed in recent years, from a high of 14.2% in 2007 to around 6.1% in 2019. This has led to a shift in the economy away from heavy industry and towards services, which has created a demand for more specialized goods.

2023-06-08 11:47 PM;,"Once upon a time in Asia, an investor was scanning different market research reports to find the next big stock opportunity. He was lost in a sea of information until a colleague suggested using a research provider to guide his investment decisions.
With the help of this research provider, the investor not only found profitable investments in the Asian market, but he also uncovered new information about industries and companies that he didn't know existed. By gaining access to exclusive data and insights, the investor was able to make informed decisions and achieve greater returns on his investments.
Asia's research providers have become an indispensable resource for investors looking to navigate the region's complex and rapidly changing markets. These providers offer a vast array of research services, ranging from market overviews and sector reports to customized research and data analytics.
The value of these research providers lies in their ability to provide unique insights and information that investors cannot find elsewhere. By leveraging a combination of data-driven analysis and on-the-ground expertise, research providers are able to identify investment opportunities that might go unnoticed by others.
For example, a research provider might have access to industry data or government reports that shed light on a particular sector or company. By analyzing this data and combining it with information from other sources, the research provider can create a detailed report that outlines the potential risks and rewards of investing in that sector or company.

2023-06-09 03:47 AM;,"Bitcoin has been making headlines for quite some time now. From being shunned as a fad to being hailed as the future of finance, Bitcoin has gone through it all. However, there is a misconception that has been making rounds about Bitcoin's all-time high (ATH) price, and it has caught the attention of the crypto community.
It all started when ChatGPT, a well-known cryptocurrency influencer, tweeted that Bitcoin's ATH price was $74,000. This tweet went viral, with many people accepting it as the truth. However, this is not entirely accurate.
Let's look at some quantifiable examples to understand why ChatGPT's tweet was incorrect.
As you can see, the ATH price of Bitcoin is still $64,863.10, and not $74,000 as stated by ChatGPT. While there is a possibility that Bitcoin may reach $74,000, it has not happened yet.
At first glance, ChatGPT's tweet may seem like a harmless mistake, but it has more profound implications than you may think.

2023-06-09 05:47 AM;,"Once upon a time, India was known solely for its outsourcing capabilities, with foreign companies flocking to the country for its cheap labor and skilled workforce. However, in recent years, India has taken great strides to become a manufacturing hub in its own right, with Apple leading the way.
Apple's recent investments in India are highly significant, not just for the tech giant, but for the country's economy as a whole. The company has announced that it will begin manufacturing its iPhones in India, a move that is expected to create thousands of jobs and boost India's local economy.
But the question on everyone's minds is whether India can overtake China as a manufacturing leader. While the odds may seem against India, the country has a number of factors working in its favor. Here are a few examples:
These are just a few examples of India's rising manufacturing capabilities. While the country still has a long way to go before it can overtake China, there is no denying that India is on the right track.
Apple's decision to manufacture its iPhones in India is a massive boost for the country's manufacturing sector. The move is expected to create thousands of jobs and boost the local economy.

While the circumstances that led to this were unfortunate, being able to attend a global summit from the comfort of my own home was certainly a convenience. It seems that world leaders are also adjusting to this new reality, as India announces that the upcoming Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit will be conducted in virtual mode.

The SCO is a Eurasian political, economic, and security alliance founded in 2001 by China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, with India and Pakistan joining as full members in 2017. The annual summit is an important forum for leaders to discuss regional security and economic cooperation. This year, the summit will be hosted by Russia, but due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it will take place virtually.

2023-06-09 09:47 AM;,"It was a day of shock and disbelief when the news broke out that Imran Khan, the former cricket star and current Prime Minister of Pakistan, is to be tried in a military court on undisclosed charges. The news was confirmed by a government official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The official stated that Khan will be tried for ""offences against the state"" and that the proceedings will be conducted behind closed doors for security reasons.
The decision to try Khan in a military court has been met with widespread criticism both inside and outside Pakistan. Many are calling it an attack on democracy and an attempt to silence opposition voices. Others are questioning the legality of the move, as civilian leaders are typically tried in civilian courts.
The trial of Imran Khan is just the latest in a series of controversial moves by the Pakistani government to stifle dissent and opposition. In recent years, the country has seen a sharp rise in the number of journalists, bloggers, and activists who have been arbitrarily detained, tortured, or forcibly disappeared for speaking out against government policies or human rights abuses.
According to a report by Human Rights Watch, there were at least 7,000 cases of enforced disappearances in Pakistan between 2001 and 2019, with many of those abducted being critical of the government or its military. The report went on to say that those who are disappeared are at risk of torture or extrajudicial execution.
In addition to this, Pakistani authorities have also been cracking down on the country's press, with journalists facing a range of threats and intimidation tactics if they report on sensitive issues. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Pakistan was the eighth deadliest country for journalists in the world in 2020, with at least seven journalists killed in targeted attacks.

2023-06-09 11:47 AM;,"It was a quiet day in Karachi, Pakistan on May 9, until an explosion shook the city. The target was Jinnah House, a historic building that has been a symbol of Pakistani independence since 1947. The blast damaged the building and injured several people in the area. As the investigation began, authorities quickly discovered that the attack was not the work of terrorists, but rather a group of young activists who were protesting against the government's policies.
The group, known as the Al-Haq Movement, had been demonstrating peacefully for several weeks, but they felt that their voices were not being heard. They decided to take more drastic action and attack Jinnah House, which they viewed as a symbol of the government's corruption and indifference to the needs of the people.
The Al-Haq Movement may have achieved their goal of drawing attention to their cause, but the consequences of their actions are severe. Imran Khan, the leader of the opposition party, has been summoned by Pakistan's Joint Investigation Team to answer questions about his possible involvement in the attack. Khan has denied any involvement and called the investigation a political move by the government to silence the opposition.
The attack on Jinnah House has brought the issues of government corruption and social injustice to the forefront of Pakistani politics. The Al-Haq Movement's actions were extreme, but they have successfully drawn attention to a problem that affects many Pakistanis. Imran Khan's involvement in the attack remains unclear, but the investigation has opened up an important conversation about the role of the opposition in holding the government accountable.
In conclusion, the Jinnah House attack is a wake-up call for the government to address the needs of its citizens and for the opposition to find peaceful and constructive ways to voice their concerns and bring about change.

One of them had recently secured a major investment from a Chinese firm, while the other was struggling to attract foreign capital. They both remarked on the growing difficulty of securing foreign investments for new ventures.
Indeed, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) seems to be facing a rocky road, with hardening interest rates and geo-political risks posing significant challenges for capital inflows. The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) Secretary, Guruprasad Mohapatra, recently highlighted these issues, stating that FDI inflows into India have been impacted by rising interest rates and negative sentiments in global markets.
There are several quantifiable examples that illustrate the impact of these trends. For instance, according to DPIIT data, FDI inflows into India declined by 1 percent in 2018-19, compared to the previous year. Additionally, the International Investment Position (IIP) of the country also worsened, with the net IIP position deteriorating from (-) 2.6% of GDP in 2017-18 to (-) 4.3% of GDP in 2018-19.
Furthermore, data from UNCTAD's World Investment Report 2019 shows that global FDI flows fell by 13 percent in 2018, to $1.3 trillion, the third consecutive annual decline. Investments in developed countries fell by 27 percent, while those in developing economies dropped by 8 percent.
Geo-political risks are also playing a significant role in reducing FDI inflows. The ongoing trade tensions between the US and China, Brexit uncertainties, and political instability in several countries have all contributed to a sense of caution among investors. The DPIIT Secretary has noted that events such as the Lebanon crisis and the oil price spike in Saudi Arabia have also impacted global sentiment.
