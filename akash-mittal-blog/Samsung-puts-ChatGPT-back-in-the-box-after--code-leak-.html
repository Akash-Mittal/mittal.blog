   <p>Samsung Electronics, one of the world's leading tech companies, has been forced to shut down its AI-powered chatbot service, ChatGPT, due to a security breach. The company discovered that the code for the chatbot had been leaked online, potentially exposing user data to hackers.</p>
   <p>The company had launched ChatGPT, which uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand and respond to user queries, with great fanfare earlier this year. It was seen as a major step forward in Samsung's efforts to build more intelligent, conversational AI systems.</p>
   <p>However, the code leak has dealt a serious blow to the company's reputation and has raised questions about the security of its AI systems. Samsung has been quick to reassure its customers that no user data has been compromised and that it has taken steps to prevent any further breaches.</p>
   <p>But the incident highlights the growing risks posed by AI-powered systems and the need for robust security measures to protect them. With more and more companies investing in AI and machine learning, the potential for security breaches is only going to increase.</p>
   <h2>Real-life examples</h2>
   <p>The Samsung incident is just the latest in a series of security breaches involving AI and machine learning systems. Last year, Tesla sued a former employee for allegedly stealing sensitive information about its self-driving technology and sharing it with a third party. The company claimed that the employee had admitted to the theft and had attempted to cover it up.</p>
   <p>And earlier this year, researchers at OpenAI discovered that an AI language model they had created was vulnerable to cyber attacks. The model, known as GPT-2, was able to generate convincing but fake news articles that could potentially be used to spread disinformation or malware.</p>
   <p>These incidents highlight the need for companies to be more vigilant in their efforts to secure AI and machine learning systems. As these technologies become more pervasive, the risks posed by security breaches will only become greater.</p>
