   <p class="intro">Broken families, blended families, and co-parenting – these are the common words we hear in the society today. In an ideal world, every couple would raise their child in a harmonious and complete family setting. However, things do not always go as planned, and sometimes parents have to incorporate co-parenting into their lives. Here, we share the experience of Max Collins, a Filipino actress and her husband, Pancho Magno, on how they make co-parenting work for their family.</p>
   <h2 class="section-title">We're Super Okay</h2>
   <p>Max and Pancho, who got married in 2017 had their first child, Skye, in July 2020. However, the pandemic had already hit, thus, the new parents have to juggle raising a newborn baby and their career amidst lockdowns and quarantines. Moreover, both of them had busy work schedules, and at some point, they had to be on location for days or even weeks.</p>
   <p>Despite everything, the couple shared on their respective social media accounts, that they are doing better than okay with co-parenting. In an interview with GMA News, Max revealed that their co-parenting journey is "super okay," because they both prioritize their child while working on their jobs.</p>
   <h2 class="section-title">Quantifiable Examples</h2>
   <p>Co-parenting requires a lot of work, patience and understanding from both parties. For Max and Pancho, they make sure that they communicate with each other regularly to discuss their child's needs and schedules. They also set boundaries and agree on the terms of their co-parenting set-up to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
   <p>Moreover, being in the show business industry, Max and Pancho's work schedules are not predictable. However, they make sure to inform the other person ahead of time if they need to be away for work.</p>
   <p>According to Max, "We have the same schedule, so we need to divide the tasks when it comes to taking care of Skye. So Pancho, whenever I'm working, he looks after Skye, and when he's working, I look after him. It's really about dividing the task whenever we need to leave for work."</p>
   <h2 class="section-title">Practical Tips</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Communicate regularly and discuss your child's needs and schedule.</li>
    <li>Set boundaries and agree on the terms of your co-parenting set-up to avoid misunderstandings.</li>

   </ul>
   <h2 class="section-title">Conclusion: Co-Parenting Works if You're Willing to Make it Work</h2>
   <p>Co-parenting is never easy, but it can work if both parties are willing to make it work. For Max and Pancho, their co-parenting journey is just starting, but they have already made significant strides to give their child a loving and nurturing family setting despite the challenges that they face.</p>
   <p>Co-parenting is not just about splitting responsibilities, but also about supporting each other as parents and being present for your child. Every family is different, so the co-parenting style may vary from one couple to another. However, one thing is for sure, the child's well-being should always be the priority.</p>
