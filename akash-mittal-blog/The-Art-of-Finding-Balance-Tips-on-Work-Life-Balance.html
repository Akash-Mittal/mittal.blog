    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>It was a Monday morning and I woke up feeling groggy and stressed. I had a big project due at work that day and I had been working on it all weekend. I was so worried about getting it done that I had neglected my personal life. My partner had been trying to make plans with me for weeks, but I always had an excuse not to go out. I was making excuses at work too, saying no to invitations to meetings and social events. I was starting to feel isolated and overwhelmed.</p>
    <p>Then, during my lunch break that day, I had a conversation with a friend who was going through something similar. She told me that she had been working hard to find balance between her work and personal life and had finally found a solution that worked for her. She suggested that I start by setting priorities and boundaries both at work and at home. I took her advice and started to make changes in my life.</p>
    <p>Now, I am happier, healthier and more productive at both work and in my personal life.</p>

    <p>According to the American Institute of Stress, stress is the major cause of more than half of all illnesses. Work-related stress is one of the main contributors to this and has been estimated to cost companies billions of dollars each year.</p>
    <p>A study conducted in 2019 by the American Psychological Association showed that more than one-third of American workers experience chronic work-related stress. Another study by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health found that 40% of workers reported their job was very or extremely stressful.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, research also shows that companies that prioritize work-life balance have better employee morale, retention and productivity rates. Companies with a strong work-life balance culture report 21% higher profits than those without, according to a study by the Corporate Executive Board.</p>
