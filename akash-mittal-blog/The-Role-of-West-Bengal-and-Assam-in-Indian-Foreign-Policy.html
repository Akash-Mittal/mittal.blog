    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>India's foreign policy is shaped by a number of factors, ranging from geopolitical considerations to economic interests. In this context, the role of West Bengal and Assam cannot be overstated, as these two Indian states serve as vital gateways to the region.</p>
    <p>West Bengal, which shares a border with Bangladesh, has historically been a hub of cross-border trade and cultural exchange. Meanwhile, Assam, located in India's northeast, shares borders with Bhutan, China, and Myanmar, thus making it a key node in India's wider "Act East" policy.</p>
    <p>In this article, we will explore the strategic significance of West Bengal and Assam in Indian foreign policy, highlighting the ways in which these states have contributed to regional security, economic cooperation, and more.</p>
    <h2 id="strategic-significance">Strategic Significance</h2>
    <p>West Bengal and Assam are strategically important for India for a number of reasons. Firstly, due to their geographical location, they serve as important gateways to other countries in the region. For example, West Bengal provides India with access to the Bay of Bengal, which is crucial for maritime trade. Similarly, Assam's proximity to China and Southeast Asia makes it a key transit point for land-based trade and transportation.</p>
    <p>Secondly, these states are important for regional connectivity initiatives such as India's "Neighborhood First" policy and the "Belt and Road Initiative" being pushed by China. India is keen on developing seamless connectivity with its neighbors such as Bangladesh and Myanmar, in order to facilitate trade and people to people contacts. The proposed Kaladan multimodal transport project will connect the eastern Indian port of Kolkata with Sittwe Port in Myanmar's Rakhine State through waterways, and from there, it will be connected to the India-Myanmar border state of Mizoram.</p>
    <h2 id="economic-cooperation">Economic Cooperation</h2>
    <p>Economic cooperation is one of the main drivers of India's foreign policy towards the region. West Bengal and Assam have huge potential in this regard, with their ports and airports serving as important hubs for trade and investment. For example, Kolkata port, the largest in eastern India, handles a significant portion of India's maritime trade with Southeast Asia.</p>
    <p>Additionally, West Bengal and Assam have significant human resources, with skilled laborers, entrepreneurs, and professionals contributing to the country's growth story. The states are also hubs of innovation and technology, with a thriving startup culture emerging in both places.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the two states are rich in natural resources, with Assam being one of India's biggest producers of petroleum, and West Bengal having a rich agricultural sector. There is great potential for cooperation in agriculture, with both states exploring ways to increase productivity and expand exports.</p>
    <h2 id="regional-security">Regional Security</h2>
    <p>West Bengal and Assam are also important for regional security, with cross-border terrorism and insurgencies posing a threat to India's national security. Both states are located in India's Northeast, which shares borders with Bangladesh, China, and Myanmar. This region has witnessed several conflicts and insurgencies, with militants often using the porous borders to move between countries.</p>
    <p>India has been working closely with its neighbors to address these security challenges, with West Bengal and Assam playing important roles in these efforts. For example, the India-Bangladesh Border Security Cooperation Agreement, inked in 2013, aims to strengthen coordination and cooperation between the two countries to curb trans-border crimes and improve border management.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In summary, the role of West Bengal and Assam in Indian foreign policy cannot be overstated. These two states serve as vital gateways to the region, connecting India to its neighbors and providing strategic advantages in terms of trade, connectivity, and security. As India looks to build closer ties with its neighbors and enhance regional cooperation, it is clear that West Bengal and Assam will continue to play key roles in shaping the country's foreign policy in the years to come.</p>
