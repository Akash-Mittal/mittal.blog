    <h2>The Incident</h2>
    <p>An instructor at TAMU Commerce recently accused an entire class of using an artificial intelligence tool called ChatGPT to complete their final assignments.</p>
    <p>ChatGPT is an AI-based chatbot that can be trained to respond to specific prompts and can generate human-like text.</p>
    <p>According to the instructor, the majority of the final assignments submitted by the class contained text that had been generated by ChatGPT, which would constitute a form of plagiarism and cheating.</p>

    <p>Cheating also carries personal consequences, including damage to one's reputation and integrity. In addition, cheating can hinder the development of essential skills that are required in the workforce, such as critical thinking and problem-solving.</p>
