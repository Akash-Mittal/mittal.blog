    <p>Have you ever struggled to plan your trip? Have you ever spent hours searching for the perfect accommodation, the best restaurants, or the most interesting activities to do at your destination? If yes, you're not alone. Planning a trip can be overwhelming, time-consuming, and stressful, especially if you're not familiar with the place you're visiting.</p>
    <p>However, a recent survey conducted by Travelport shows that more and more US travelers are turning to chatbots to make their trip planning easier and more efficient. According to the survey, 1/3 of US travelers have already used a chatbot or a virtual assistant to plan their trips, and 58% of them found the experience better than searching for information on their own.</p>
    <h3>What is ChatGPT?</h3>
    <p>If you're not familiar with chatbots, let me explain. A chatbot is a computer program that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to chat with human users and assist them in different tasks. Chatbots can be integrated into messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, or Slack, or they can have their own standalone apps or websites.</p>
    <p>ChatGPT is one of the most advanced chatbots currently available. It uses the latest AI technologies to understand natural language and provide personalized recommendations to users. ChatGPT can help you plan your trip by answering your questions, suggesting activities and attractions based on your interests, providing you with the best deals on flights and hotels, and even booking your tickets and accommodations for you.</p>
