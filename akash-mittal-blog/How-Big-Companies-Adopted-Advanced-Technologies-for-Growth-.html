   <p>Once upon a time, there were giants in different industries. These giants were performing well with traditional technology, but they needed to adopt advanced technologies to reduce costs, increase profits, and maintain their competitive edge.</p>
   <p>For instance, General Electric (GE) is a conglomerate of different businesses like aviation, healthcare, renewable energy, and finance. GE transformed their Aviation division with the help of artificial intelligence (AI), data analytics, and the Internet of things (IoT). GE's AI software enhances aircraft engines' performance by predicting when and what parts will fail in advance.</p>
   <p>Similarly, Walmart, the world's biggest retailer, uses AI-powered robots to clean floors and stocks shelves. These robots can monitor product inventory, identify incorrect prices, and alert staff when items run low.</p>
   <h2>Real-Life Examples:</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Amazon's automated warehouses use robots and sensors, which can automate the packaging, labeling, and inventory management. Also, Amazon's recommendation engine provides personalized suggestions to the customers based on their past purchases and searches.</li>
    <li>Alibaba uses facial recognition technology to notify customers when they enter a mall. The system can analyze shopper data such as age, gender, and past purchases to personalize in-store promotions.</li>
    <li>Coca-Cola uses IoT sensors in vending machines to track sales, temperature, and product inventory. These sensors predict when a vending machine is running low and notify the supply chain team.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>To sum up, the integration of advanced technologies in different industries has become mandatory for growth and survival. That's why large companies are heavily investing in data analytics, AI, IoT, and cloud computing. These technologies will continue to revolutionize businesses, and those who resist this change will lose their competitiveness.</p>
   <h2>Critical Comments:</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>The adoption of advanced technologies will replace some jobs but create new ones. Companies should focus on re-skilling and up-skilling their employees.</li>
    <li>The implementation of new technologies has some risks like cyber attacks, privacy concerns, and ethical issues. Companies should follow best practices and regulations to avoid potential damage.</li>
    <li>Lastly, companies that ignore these technologies will fall behind the competition. Hence, it is crucial for organizations to reassess their strategies and invest in advanced technologies.</li>
