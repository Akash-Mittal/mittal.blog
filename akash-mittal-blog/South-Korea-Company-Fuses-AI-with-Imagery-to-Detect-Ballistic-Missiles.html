    <h2>Background:</h2><!--Interesting Story-->
    <p>Imagine living in a country threatened with ballistic missile attacks from a hostile neighbor. The fear of sudden destruction is a constant presence in your daily life. South Koreans don't need to imagine this scenario as they have been living with it for decades. As a result, the country has invested heavily in developing and deploying defense technologies to detect, track, and intercept incoming missiles.</p>
    <p>A South Korean company called Hanwha Systems is one of the leaders in this field. It has recently demonstrated a new technology that fuses artificial intelligence (AI) with imagery to detect ballistic missiles. This innovation is significant because it can enhance the accuracy and speed of missile detection, which is crucial for effective defense against missile attacks.</p>

   <section id="technology">
    <h2>Technology:</h2>
    <p>The technology developed by Hanwha Systems works by analyzing imagery from various sources, such as ground-based radars, satellites, and drones. By using AI algorithms, the system can identify and track ballistic missiles in real-time and provide alerts to the defense command center.</p>
    <p>What makes this technology unique is its ability to fuse multiple types of imagery and AI models to achieve the highest level of accuracy and reliability. For example, the system can combine radar and satellite data to detect missiles at different stages of flight, from launch to re-entry. It can also use advanced AI models, such as deep learning, to adapt to new patterns and behaviors of missiles and avoid false alarms.</p>
    <p>This technology can support various defense systems, such as missile defense interceptors, air defense artillery, and command and control centers. By providing early warning and situational awareness, it can help military leaders make critical decisions on how to respond to missile threats.</p><!--Reference URLs-->

   <section id="examples">
    <h2>Examples:</h2>
    <p>One example of how this technology can be used is in the recent joint military exercise conducted by South Korea and the United States in March 2021. Hanwha Systems provided its AI-based ballistic missile detection system to the exercise, which involved detecting and tracking a simulated missile attack from North Korea. The system successfully detected and identified the missiles in real-time, providing critical information to the defense command center to plan countermeasures.</p>
    <p>Another example is the deployment of this technology in the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), the highly fortified border between North and South Korea. The DMZ is one of the most sensitive and heavily guarded areas in the world, and any missile threat can escalate into a full-blown conflict. By deploying Hanwha's system in the DMZ, South Korea can enhance its defense readiness and ensure rapid response to missile attacks.</p><!--Quantifiable Examples-->
    <p>Quantifiable examples: Hanwha Systems claims that its AI-based ballistic missile detection system has an accuracy rate of over 90% and can detect missiles within a range of 800 km. The system can also provide alerts within 10 seconds of missile launch and track the missiles in real-time with a positional accuracy of less than 10 meters. These performance metrics demonstrate the potential of this technology to improve missile defense capabilities and save lives.</p>
