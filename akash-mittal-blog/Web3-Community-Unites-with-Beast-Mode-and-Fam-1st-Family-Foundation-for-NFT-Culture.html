  <p>It was a sunny day in Oakland, California, and the community was buzzing with excitement as former NFL running back Marshawn Lynch and his non-profit organization, Fam 1st Family Foundation, teamed up with the Web3 community for a unique event. The goal was to introduce the world of NFTs to a diverse group of young people from the community, and to empower them with knowledge, skills, and resources to become active participants in the fast-growing world of digital art and collectibles.</p>
  <p>The event was a huge success, with over 200 participants from all walks of life, including students, artists, musicians, and gamers. The day was filled with workshops, panel discussions, live art demonstrations, and opportunities for attendees to create and sell their own NFTs.</p>
  <h2> NFT Culture</h2>
  <p>The world of NFTs is exploding in popularity and value, and there are many examples of how this new form of digital ownership and creativity is transforming industries and communities.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>In March 2021, a digital artwork by the artist Beeple sold for a whopping $69 million at a Christie's auction, making it the first NFT to be sold by a major auction house.</li>
   <li>The NBA has embraced NFTs through its Top Shot platform, which allows fans to buy, sell and trade digital basketball highlights like they would physical trading cards. In just a few months, the platform has generated over $500 million in sales.</li>
   <li>The music industry is also exploring the potential of NFTs, with artists like Grimes and Deadmau5 selling unique digital music and artwork to their fans as NFTs.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Empowering Communities through NFTs</h2>
  <p>The Web3 community and Fam 1st Family Foundation are committed to using the power of NFTs to empower communities and individuals who have been historically left out of traditional wealth creation and access to digital opportunities. This includes people of color, low-income communities, and artists and creators who have been marginalized or undervalued by traditional gatekeepers.</p>
  <p>By providing education, resources, and support for NFT creation and distribution, these organizations are helping to create a new economy based on creativity, collaboration, and digital ownership. They are also working to create a more inclusive and equitable future, where everyone has the chance to participate in the rapidly evolving world of Web3.</p>
