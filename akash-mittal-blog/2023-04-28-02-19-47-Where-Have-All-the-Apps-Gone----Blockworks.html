    <p class="story">Once upon a time, it seemed like every business or organization had an app for their customers to download. From social media platforms to restaurants and retailers, apps were all the rage. Nowadays, however, app downloads have seen a decline. What happened?</p>
    <p>For starters, the novelty has worn off. Users are no longer keen to download every new app that comes out. Additionally, with a limited amount of storage on our mobile devices, users are becoming more selective with their app downloads.</p>
    <p>As a result, businesses are adapting. Rather than relying solely on apps, many are now focusing on mobile-friendly websites. By optimizing their site for mobile devices, businesses can still provide a seamless user experience without the need for a separate app. For example, Instagram has a mobile website that functions similarly to their app, so users can still access and browse their feed even if they haven't downloaded the app.</p>
    <p>Another option is to create Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). These web apps combine the best features of both websites and mobile apps, offering a seamless experience for users. PWAs are faster, more reliable, and even work offline. For example, Pinterest created a PWA that increased their user engagement and decreased their bounce rate.</p>
    <h2>Concrete Examples</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>Starbucks famously closed down their standalone app in 2019, instead focusing on their mobile-friendly website and providing a more streamlined experience for users.</li>
     <li>The Washington Post created a PWA that helped them increase engagement and hook readers with easier accessibility.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In summary, the decline of app downloads doesn't mean the end of mobile optimization for businesses. With the rise of mobile-friendly websites and PWAs, businesses have options to continue providing a seamless user experience.</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Focusing on mobile-friendly websites ensures that businesses can still provide a smooth user experience without the need for a separate app.</li>
     <li>Progressive Web Apps combine the best features of websites and mobile apps, offering faster, more reliable experiences for users.</li>
     <li>Examples like Starbucks and The Washington Post show that businesses are already adapting and embracing these changes to continue reaching their users.</li>
