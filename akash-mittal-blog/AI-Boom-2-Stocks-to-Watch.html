  <p></p>
  <p>As a young girl, Sarah often snuck into her father's office, fascinated by the sound of the whirring computer and the stacks of circuit boards piled high on his desk. Her father worked in artificial intelligence research, and Sarah couldn't get enough of the stories he shared with her about the amazing things this technology could do.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Fast forward to today, and Sarah is now a successful tech investor with a keen interest in the AI boom that's taking place. She's excited about all the ways AI is changing the world, from the way doctors diagnose illnesses to the way retailers personalize their marketing.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>But with so many companies claiming to be at the forefront of AI, how can investors be sure they're making the right choices?</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>According to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, there are two stocks that are leading the pack when it comes to AI: Nvidia itself and the Chinese tech giant Baidu. Here's what Huang had to say about these companies during Nvidia's recent earnings call:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>"Nvidia is really unmatched in AI. We're responsible for the democratization of AI, and we're really thrilled to be at the forefront of this incredible journey. And then there is Baidu. They're the leader in China, and they are doing some amazing work."</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>But what exactly is it that makes these two companies stand out from the rest?</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Nvidia: The King of AI Chips</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One of the reasons Nvidia is so well-positioned in the AI space is its expertise in creating powerful graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs are essential for running the complex algorithms that power AI, and Nvidia's chips are some of the best in the world.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>But it's not just about having the best hardware. Nvidia has also invested heavily in software and tools that make it easier for developers to create AI applications. For example, its CUDA platform provides a programming language and tools specifically designed for running deep learning algorithms on GPUs.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>All of this has helped Nvidia become a leader in a variety of AI applications, from self-driving cars to medical imaging. And as AI continues to grow and evolve, Nvidia is well-positioned to capitalize on those opportunities.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Baidu: The AI Leader in China</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>While Nvidia has a global reputation in the AI space, Baidu has focused mainly on the Chinese market. But that doesn't mean the company's contributions to AI are any less significant.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In fact, Baidu is often referred to as "the Google of China," and its expertise in search and natural language processing has made it a leader in AI-powered voice assistants. Its DuerOS platform is currently used in more than 200 million devices, including smart speakers and mobile phones.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>But Baidu's AI ambitions extend far beyond voice assistants. The company is also investing heavily in autonomous driving technology, cloud computing, and healthcare. And with China's large and growing market, Baidu is in a great position to reap the rewards of its AI efforts.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3 Key Takeaways</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>So what can investors learn from these two companies and their success in the AI space? Here are three key takeaways:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Hardware and software are equally important. Having the best chips isn't enough to excel in AI â€“ companies also need to invest in software platforms and tools that make it easier for developers to create applications.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. China is a major player in AI. While companies like Nvidia have global reach, Baidu's dominance in China shows that there are significant opportunities in the country's growing tech market.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. AI is already impacting multiple industries. From healthcare to retail, there are a variety of industries that stand to benefit from AI. Investors who focus on companies with strong AI offerings in these areas could be well-positioned for long-term growth.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Investor Tip: Keep a Close Eye on Nvidia and Baidu</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>While there are certainly other companies to watch in the AI space, Nvidia and Baidu are two of the biggest players right now. As this technology continues to evolve and become more ubiquitous, these companies are likely to be at the forefront of those changes.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Investors in the tech sector should keep a close eye on these stocks and consider adding them to their portfolios as a way to capitalize on the growing AI boom.</p>
