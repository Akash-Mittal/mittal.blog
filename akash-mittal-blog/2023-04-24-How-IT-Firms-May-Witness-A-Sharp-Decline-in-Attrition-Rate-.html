    <p>John was a talented software developer who had been working at an IT firm for the past two years. However, despite his exceptional performance, he decided to leave the company due to a lack of growth opportunities and a poor work-life balance. This scenario is all too familiar in the IT industry where employees switch jobs frequently, causing high attrition rates.</p>
    <h2>Concrete Examples</h2>
    <p>According to a survey by Mercer, the attrition rate in the Indian IT industry reached a staggering 13% in 2020. The pandemic has only worsened the situation as remote working has increased stress and burnout among employees. However, some IT firms have managed to keep their attrition rate low. For example, Infosys reduced its attrition rate to 10% from 20% by implementing various HR strategies, such as upskilling programs, flexible work policies, and recognition programs.</p>
