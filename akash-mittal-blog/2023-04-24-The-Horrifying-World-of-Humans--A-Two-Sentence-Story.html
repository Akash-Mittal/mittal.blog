   <p>Once upon a time, in a world where humans roamed the earth, the skies turned red and the oceans turned black with the blood of their own kind. As if it wasn't enough already, their reflections started showing their worst fears instead of their faces in the mirrors.</p>
   <p>Scary, right? This two-sentence horror story narrated by ChatGPT sums up the inherent darkness that resides in humans. While it may seem like a work of fiction, it is not very different from the atrocities we have committed in the past and continue to do so in the present.</p>
   <h2>Concrete Examples of Human Horror</h2>
   <p>From wars to genocide, from slavery to discrimination, from rape to murder, humans have committed some of the most heinous crimes in the history of the world. While we may justify them in the name of religion, race, or nationality, the truth is that they all boil down to one thing - our innate darkness.</p>
   <p>Even in our day-to-day lives, we exhibit traits that are not very different from the horror story above. We lie, cheat, and hurt others without any remorse. We judge people based on their appearance, beliefs, and lifestyle. We engage in materialistic pursuits at the cost of our environment and other living beings. All of these actions point towards the fact that we are not as evolved as we like to think.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The horror story narrated by ChatGPT is a wake-up call for us to acknowledge the darkness within us and take steps towards becoming better human beings. Here are three points to ponder upon:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>We need to introspect and identify the areas where we exhibit our darkness.</li>
    <li>We need to educate ourselves about the consequences of our actions and strive towards making positive changes.</li>
    <li>We need to acknowledge the darkness within us and embrace it instead of denying or suppressing it.</li>
   </ol>
