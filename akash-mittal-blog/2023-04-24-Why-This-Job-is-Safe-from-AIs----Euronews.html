   <p>John is a seasoned accountant and has been working in the field for over two decades. Despite the advancement of technology, John's job is still safe from the threat of automation. His job requires a high level of expertise and knowledge, which cannot be replaced by machines.</p>
   <p>There are many jobs out there, which are at risk of being taken over by AIs. For example, jobs that involve repetitive tasks or are rule-based are more likely to be automated. However, there are some jobs that are immune to automation. Here are three such jobs:</p>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>Accountants:</strong> As mentioned earlier, accountants are experts in their field and have a deep understanding of tax laws, regulations, and financial reporting. While some of their tasks, such as data entry, may be automated, there are still many tasks that require human intelligence, such as analyzing financial data, making judgments, and providing advice to clients.</li>
    <li><strong>Teachers:</strong> Teaching is a complex job that requires a high level of emotional intelligence, creativity, and adaptability. It is difficult for machines to replicate the human interactions that take place in a classroom, such as providing feedback, encouraging students, and building relationships.</li>
    <li><strong>Doctors:</strong> While machines can perform some medical procedures, such as taking X-rays or analyzing data, doctors are still needed to make diagnostic decisions, provide treatment options, and communicate sensitive information to patients and their families.</li>
   </ol>
   <p>While the jobs mentioned above may not be completely safe from automation in the future, they are certainly more immune to it than others. It is important for individuals to stay informed about the advancements in technology and to keep up-to-date with the skills needed in their industry.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Jobs that require expertise, creativity or human interaction are less likely to be automated.</li>
    <li>Accountants, teachers, and doctors are a few examples of jobs that are relatively safe from automation.</li>
    <li>Individuals should remain informed about the advancements in technology and continue to learn new skills to future-proof their careers.</li>
   </ul>
