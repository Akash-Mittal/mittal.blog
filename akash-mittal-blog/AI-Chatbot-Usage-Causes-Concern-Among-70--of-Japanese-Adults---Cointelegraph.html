   <p>Imagine waking up one day and finding out that you've been replaced by a chatbot at work. This is exactly what happened to Yuki, a customer service representative in a Japanese company, who was replaced by an AI chatbot named Sumi. Yuki was not the only employee laid off by the company in favor of chatbots. Many others lost their jobs too.</p>
   <p>This trend of using AI chatbots in customer service and other industries has been growing rapidly in Japan. However, a recent survey by Cointelegraph Japan reveals that 70% of Japanese adults are concerned about the impact of chatbots on employment and society as a whole.</p>
   <p>One of the main concerns is that chatbots might replace human workers, leading to widespread unemployment. This has already happened in many companies across Japan, and the trend is likely to continue. However, proponents of chatbots argue that they can actually create new job opportunities in fields related to AI and automation.</p>
   <p>Another concern is that chatbots might not be able to provide the same level of service as human workers. There have been cases where chatbots have given incorrect information or failed to understand customer queries. This can damage a company's reputation and lead to lost business. However, chatbot developers are working hard to improve the technology and make it more reliable.</p>
   <p>Despite these concerns, many companies in Japan are embracing chatbots as a cost-effective and efficient way to provide customer service. Some of the main players in the industry include Softbank, LINE, and Sony. Softbank's Pepper robot, for example, has been deployed in various public spaces like airports and shopping malls to provide assistance to customers.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, the use of AI chatbots in Japan is causing concern among many adults due to the potential impact on employment and service quality. However, proponents argue that chatbots can create new job opportunities and improve efficiency. The industry is dominated by companies like Softbank, LINE, and Sony, who are investing heavily in chatbot development.</p>
