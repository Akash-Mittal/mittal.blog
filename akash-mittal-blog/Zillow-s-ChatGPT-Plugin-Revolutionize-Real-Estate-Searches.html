     <h2>How Zillow is Using AI to Change the Home Search Game</h2>
     <p>Imagine you're on Zillow's website, searching for your dream house. Suddenly, a virtual assistant pops up and asks, "What's on your mind?" You type back, "I want a three-bedroom, two-bath home with a large backyard in a good school district." Within seconds, the virtual assistant sends you suggested listings matching your criteria</p>
     <p>This is the power of ChatGPT, Zillow's new AI-powered plugin. It uses advanced natural language processing technology to understand your search queries and provide you with the most relevant results. You can also ask it questions like, "What's the average price per square foot in this neighborhood?" and it'll give you an accurate answer.</p>
