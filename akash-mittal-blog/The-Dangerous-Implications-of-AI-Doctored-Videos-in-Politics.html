  <p>Recently, a video clip of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis giving a press conference was shared by Donald Trump Jr on his social media account. The clip was edited to show DeSantis stumbling over his words and looking foolish. However, this was not the reality; the clip had been AI doctored to make DeSantis look bad.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This incident raises a serious question about the impact of AI-doctored video clips in politics. If a simple clip like this can be tampered with so easily, how can we trust the authenticity of any political video?</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The implications are dangerous. Political candidates and public officials could be targeted with deepfakes â€“ videos that appear to show them saying or doing something they did not. These videos could be used to spread false information, manipulate public opinion, or even blackmail individuals.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>But how do we quantify the impact of this issue? The answer is in the numbers. According to a Pew Research Center study, 64% of Americans say made-up news is causing confusion about basic facts and current events.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another example is the infamous Nancy Pelosi deepfake, which portrayed her slurring her words and appearing heavily intoxicated. The clip went viral and generated thousands of shares and comments, despite the fact that it was false. This is the dangerous power that AI-doctored video clips hold.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>So, what can be done about this growing problem? Firstly, we need to raise awareness about the existence and dangers of AI-doctored videos. Secondly, tech companies need to develop advanced software that can detect these fakes and flag them as such. Finally, we need to increase the penalties for those who create and distribute these videos.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, AI-doctored videos have the potential to be a serious threat to the integrity of our political discourse. Action needs to be taken to prevent the proliferation of these videos and to ensure that the public can trust the authenticity of political messages.</p>
