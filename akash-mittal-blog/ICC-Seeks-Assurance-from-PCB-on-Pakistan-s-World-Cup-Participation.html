   <p>As the excitement builds for the upcoming cricket World Cup in India, there is one team that has been causing quite a stir.</p>
   <p>Pakistan's participation in the tournament has been called into question after recent events in the region. The International Cricket Council (ICC) has reached out to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for reassurance that the team will indeed be travelling to India to take part in the tournament.</p>
   <p>The tension between India and Pakistan has been simmering for months, with both sides accusing each other of various transgressions. The situation escalated in February, when a terrorist attack in the Indian-run region of Kashmir led to India carrying out airstrikes on targets in Pakistan.</p>
   <p>With the safety of Pakistan's cricketers in India now in question, the ICC has taken steps to deal with the situation. The governing body has asked the PCB to provide a guarantee that the team will be safe during the tournament, and has warned that if the assurance is not forthcoming, Pakistan's participation may be in doubt.</p>
