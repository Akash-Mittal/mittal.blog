  <h1>The Senate Hearing on AI Shows Lawmakers Still Don't Get It</h1> <img src="images/The-Senate-Hearing-on-AI-Shows-Lawmakers-Still-Don-t-Get-It.jpeg" alt="+The-Senate-Hearing-on-AI-Shows-Lawmakers-Still-Don-t-Get-It+">
  <p>On an early morning in June, a group of lawmakers gathered in a Senate hearing room to discuss the future of artificial intelligence (AI). The hearing was prompted by the increasing use of AI in various industries, from healthcare to finance, and the concerns surrounding the ethical implications of such technology. However, what became clear during the hearing was that many of the lawmakers simply didn't understand the technology they were discussing.</p>
  <h2>The Lack of Understanding</h2>
  <p>During the hearing, lawmakers asked questions that demonstrated their lack of understanding of AI and its capabilities. For example, Senator John Doe asked if AI could be used to stop all crime in America. While the question may seem logical to someone unfamiliar with AI, it left experts scratching their heads.</p>
  <p>The truth is, AI is not yet advanced enough to eliminate all crime in America. While it can certainly help law enforcement agencies predict and prevent crime, it cannot solve all of the complex social and economic issues that lead to criminal activity. Yet, the fact that a lawmaker would ask such a question shows just how little they understand AI and its limitations.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>According to a recent survey, only 6% of US lawmakers have a degree in science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) fields.</li>
   <li>AI is expected to create 2.3 million jobs by 2020, yet there is a growing skills gap in the workforce when it comes to AI.</li>
   <li>The US government spent $1.1 billion on non-defense AI research and development in 2019. However, that amount is only a fraction of what other countries, such as China, are investing in AI.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>The Consequences</h2>
  <p>The lack of understanding of AI among lawmakers has serious consequences. For example, it could result in poorly crafted legislation that stifles innovation and limits the use of AI in certain industries. It could also lead to a lack of investment in AI research and development, which would put the US at a disadvantage compared to other countries.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, as AI becomes more integrated into our daily lives, it is important that lawmakers understand the potential risks and benefits of the technology. Without this understanding, they may not be able to effectively regulate its use and ensure that it is being used ethically and responsibly.</p>
  <h2>What Can We Do?</h2>
  <p>It is clear that lawmakers need to better understand AI and its capabilities. However, this is easier said than done. Here are some steps that can be taken to help bridge the gap:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Invest in STEM education: By investing in STEM education, we can ensure that the next generation of lawmakers and policymakers have a strong understanding of AI and other emerging technologies.</li>
   <li>Engage with AI experts: Lawmakers should seek out and engage with AI experts, such as academics, researchers, and industry professionals. By doing so, they can gain a better understanding of the technology and its capabilities, as well as the potential risks and benefits.</li>
   <li>Encourage collaboration: Collaboration between government, industry, and academia is crucial when it comes to advancing AI. Lawmakers should encourage and facilitate these collaborations to ensure that AI research and development continues to progress.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>The lack of understanding of AI among lawmakers is alarming.</li>
   <li>This lack of understanding can have serious consequences, including poorly crafted legislation and a lack of investment in AI research and development.</li>
   <li>To bridge the gap, we need to invest in STEM education, engage with AI experts, and encourage collaboration between government, industry, and academia.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>It is important that lawmakers understand the technology they are tasked with regulating. By taking these steps, we can help ensure that AI is used ethically and responsibly, and that it continues to drive innovation and growth in the US economy.</p>
