    <p>As a mother to a 6-year-old son, Kelly Rowland knows the challenges that come with parenting. But she's also learned a valuable lesson in the process: it's okay to ask for help.</p>
    <p>In an interview with REVOLT TV, the former Destiny's Child singer talked about the importance of seeking support when you're a new parent. "I wish somebody would've told me when I first had my kid, it's okay to ask for help," she said. "It's okay to ask for somebody to come over for a few hours so you can take a nap."</p>
    <p>Rowland also discussed the pressures that society puts on mothers, especially when it comes to returning to their pre-baby bodies. "I don't think that's fair," she said. "It takes time for your body to heal, and every woman's journey is different."</p>
    <p>According to a study by the Pew Research Center, 41% of Americans say that being a working parent makes it harder to be a good parent. This is where asking for help can make all the difference. Whether it's hiring a babysitter for a few hours so you can catch up on work, or getting a friend to watch your child while you run errands, having a support system can make parenting a little easier.</p>
    <p>Here are three key takeaways from Kelly Rowland's thoughts on parenting and asking for help:</p>
    <ol>
     <li><strong>It's okay to ask for help.</strong> Parenting is hard, and there's no shame in needing a little assistance from time to time. Don't feel like you have to do it all on your own.</li>
     <li><strong>Don't let society dictate how you should feel.</strong> There's a lot of pressure on mothers to be perfect, but that's simply not realistic. It's important to remember that every journey is different, and there's no right or wrong way to be a parent.</li>
     <li><strong>Build a support system.</strong> Whether it's family, friends, or paid help, having people you can rely on can make all the difference when it comes to parenting. Don't be afraid to reach out to others for support.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Rowland's words of wisdom are a reminder that parenting is a journey, and there's no shame in asking for help along the way.</p>
