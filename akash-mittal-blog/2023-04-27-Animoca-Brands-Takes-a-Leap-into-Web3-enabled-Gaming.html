   <p>Imagine walking into a virtual world where you own everything - from your clothes, your house, your car, to your virtual money. You interact with other players and engage in various activities. You can buy, sell, trade, and use all your possessions as you please. This is the future of gaming, known as the Metaverse, and it is closer than you think.</p>
   <p>Animoca Brands, a pioneering gaming company, is set to revolutionize the gaming industry by integrating Web3 technology to provide boundless experiences for gamers. Web3, also known as the decentralized web, is a new infrastructure that allows individuals to interact with each other, without the need for intermediaries. It is built on top of blockchain technology and enables the creation of decentralized applications (dApps).</p><img src="https://blockworks.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AB-at-Polygon-NFT-Summit-Q32021-2.jpg" alt="Animoca Brands at Polygon NFT Summit Q3 2021">
   <blockquote>
    âWeb3 is the new frontier, and those who master it will change the world in profound ways,â said Yat Siu, co-founder and chairman of Animoca Brands.
   </blockquote>
   <p>Animoca Brands has already made significant strides in the Web3-enabled gaming space, with several successful games that use blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) such as The Sandbox and F1 Delta Time. These games allow users to create their own virtual worlds, race cars, and own virtual assets that can be traded and exchanged.</p>
   <p>But Animoca Brands has bigger plans. They are working on creating the Metaverse, a persistent and immersive virtual world where players can live, work, play, and own everything. They are doing this by acquiring various gaming and tech companies that have expertise in various aspects of Web3 technology.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>In June 2021, Animoca Brands acquired nWay, a game development studio that specializes in real-time multiplayer games, blockchain technology, and NFTs.</li>
    <li>In August 2021, they acquired Gamma Innovations, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform builder that enables the creation of new DeFi apps that can be integrated into blockchain games.</li>
    <li>In September 2021, they acquired Bondly, a non-custodial NFT platform with a suite of DeFi tools that allow for easy and secure trade of digital assets.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>These acquisitions will allow Animoca Brands to build the infrastructure needed to create the Metaverse, where any asset or property can be tokenized and traded. In addition, Animoca Brands is working on creating a universal digital wallet that will allow users to seamlessly move between different games and apps in the Metaverse.</p>
