    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>Many people fear that the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) will lead to widespread unemployment. However, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna believes that declining populations are the real threat to jobs.</p>
    <p>In a recent interview with CNBC, Krishna said that the growing shortage of skilled workers is a bigger problem than the potential displacement of jobs by AI. He pointed out that many countries such as Japan, Italy, and Spain are facing declining populations, which poses a serious challenge for businesses that need skilled workers.</p>
    <p>Krishna suggested that AI can actually help fill this gap by augmenting human capabilities and enabling workers to be more productive with fewer resources. However, he also noted that businesses need to invest in retraining workers who may be displaced by AI.</p>
