  <p>Starbucks, the famous coffeehouse chain, has announced that it will be expanding its Web3 Rewards program with the airdropping of more Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) in June 2022. As per the latest reports, Starbucks has already begun the process of creating more NFTs, which will be offered as rewards to its customers through a blockchain-based loyalty program.</p>
  
  <p>The story of Starbucks and its NFTs began in late 2021, when the coffeehouse chain introduced a blockchain-based rewards program in the form of NFTs. The initiative was aimed at enticing more customers to join the loyalty program by offering them unique and valuable digital assets that could be redeemed for various perks and discounts.</p>
  <p>The first set of Starbucks NFTs, which were based on the company's popular drinks, proved to be a massive hit, with customers snapping them up within hours of their launch. The success of the program prompted the company to double down on its efforts and create more NFTs that could provide even greater value to its customers.</p>
  
  <p>The popularity of Starbucks' NFTs can be gauged from the fact that the first set sold out within hours of their launch. According to reports, the NFTs were priced between $2 to $5, and customers were able to redeem them for free drinks and food at select Starbucks locations.</p>
  <p>Another quantifiable example of the success of the program is the surge in the price of Starbucks' NFTs on various NFT marketplaces. Some of the NFTs, which were originally sold for a few dollars, are now being traded for hundreds or even thousands of dollars, providing a massive return on investment to their original buyers.</p>
