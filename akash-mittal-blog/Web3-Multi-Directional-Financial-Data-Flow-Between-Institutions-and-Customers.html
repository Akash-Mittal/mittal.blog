   <p>John was a successful business owner who had always been hesitant about sharing his financial information with banks or institutions. He found it inconvenient to submit multiple documents and interact with multiple representatives. However, with the introduction of Web3, he was able to access a single platform that enabled multiple institutions to access his financial information without any hassle. This made his life easier as he could easily manage his accounts on a single platform.</p>
   
   <ul>
    <li>Web3 enabled transactions worth $12 trillion globally in 2020.</li>
    <li>Web3 has reduced data leakage incidents by 75%.</li>
    <li>Web3 ensures 45% faster transaction processing time than traditional banking methods.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>The Multi-Directional Financial Data Flow</h2>
   <p>In the past, financial data flow was unidirectional. Banks and institutions would collect and share customer information, but customers had no access to it. This led to a lack of transparency and difficulties in tracking financial data. However, with the advent of Web3, financial data flow has become multi-directional. Institutions and customers can access each other's financial data without any issues, which has revolutionized the financial industry.</p>
   <h2>The Benefits of a Multi-Directional Approach</h2>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>Enhanced Transparency:</strong> With Web3, both customers and institutions can access each other's data. This increased transparency minimizes fraudulent activities and builds trust between the two parties.</li>
    <li><strong>Improved Efficiency:</strong> Due to the multi-directional approach, financial institutions can access customer data in real-time, which saves both parties time and effort.</li>
    <li><strong>Cuts Costs:</strong> With Web3, institutions can reduce the cost of data collection and management as the customers provide the data on a single platform.</li>
   </ol>
