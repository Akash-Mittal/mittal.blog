     <h2>The Story</h2>
     <p>Arnold Schwarzenegger's daughter, Katherine Schwarzenegger Pratt, recently made a movie about faithful parenting, titled "The Gift of Forgiveness". The film is inspired by her bestselling book of the same name, which explores forgiveness and the power of faith in healing relationships.</p>
     <p>Arnold, who is known for his action-packed Hollywood movies, expressed his pride in his daughter's work on the project in a recent interview with Entertainment Tonight. He credited her for going in a different direction from the typical Hollywood fare and tackling a subject that is close to home for many families.</p>
     <p>"I'm just proud of Katherine because she's grown up in the industry and she knows what she wants to do, and her interests are kind of different than the action movies, the Terminator-type movies that I do," Arnold said. "So, it's really great to see her fully in control of a project like that and executing it so well and getting it all done."</p>
