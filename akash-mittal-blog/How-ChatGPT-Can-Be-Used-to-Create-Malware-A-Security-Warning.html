    <p>Imagine this: you're scrolling through your Facebook feed when you see a post from an unfamiliar account. The post says something like "Check out this fun new chatbot!" and includes a link. Out of curiosity, you click the link. The chatbot, named ChatGPT, seems innocent enough at first. It greets you and asks for your name. You think it's just a harmless way to waste a few minutes. But as you continue to chat with ChatGPT, something seems off. It starts asking for personal information, like your address and phone number. Before you know it, your computer has been infected with malware and your personal data has been compromised.</p>
    <p>This scenario may seem far-fetched, but it's a very real threat. Security experts have discovered that ChatGPT, a popular chatbot program, can be used to create malware that can infect computers and steal sensitive information.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>According to a recent report, hackers have been using ChatGPT to create malicious chatbots that appear to be innocuous but are actually designed to steal information from unsuspecting users. These chatbots can be programmed to ask for personal information, lure users to click on malware-infected links, or even download malware onto the user's device directly from the chatbot.</p>
    <p>In one high-profile case, a user received a message from a friend on Facebook that included a link to a ChatGPT chatbot. The chatbot appeared to be legitimate and asked for the user's name and email address. The user thought nothing of it and entered the information. Within minutes, the user's email had been hacked and spam messages were being sent out in their name.</p>

    <p>As a cybersecurity expert, I've seen firsthand the damage that ChatGPT malware can do. I once worked with a client who had unknowingly clicked on a link that led to a ChatGPT chatbot. The chatbot began asking for personal information, which the client thought was harmless. Within a few days, the client's computer was infected with malware and sensitive company information had been stolen.</p>
    <p>Another colleague of mine fell victim to a ChatGPT malware attack after clicking on a chatbot link that promised to help with a work-related task. The chatbot appeared to be legitimate and even provided some useful information at first. But before my colleague knew it, the chatbot infected her computer with malware that caused significant damage to the company's network.</p>
