  <div class="intro">
   <p>Lawyers are trained to research and analyze legal issues to provide the best possible representation for their clients. With the growing use of technology, legal research has become faster and more efficient. However, relying solely on technology can lead to disastrous consequences, as one US lawyer recently learned.</p>
   <p>The lawyer, whose name has not been disclosed, was working on a case involving a complex legal issue. In an attempt to save time, the lawyer turned to ChatGPT, a chatbot-based legal research tool.</p>
   <p>ChatGPT uses advanced artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze legal issues and provide quick answers to legal questions. The tool is designed to be a time-saving solution for busy lawyers who don't have the resources to conduct extensive legal research.</p>
   <p>However, relying solely on ChatGPT proved to be a mistake for the US lawyer. After presenting ChatGPT's answer to the court, opposing counsel discovered that the answer was incorrect. The lawyer was left scrambling to find the correct answer and salvage the case.</p>
