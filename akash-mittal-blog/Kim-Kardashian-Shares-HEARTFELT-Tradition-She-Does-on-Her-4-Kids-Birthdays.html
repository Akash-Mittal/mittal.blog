  <p>It's not surprising that the Kardashians throw elaborate birthday parties for their family members, considering they are known for their lavish lifestyles. However, what may come as a surprise is the heartfelt tradition that Kim Kardashian shares with her four children on their birthdays.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In an interview with E! News, Kim revealed that she writes her kids a letter every year on their birthday, which she keeps in a special box for them to read later in life.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>"I think it'll be really special when they're older to get a letter that I wrote them each year," Kim said. "I hope they keep them and cherish them forever."</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>While writing a letter may seem like a small gesture, it is a powerful way to create a special memory for your child. Here are some quantifiable examples of how letter writing can benefit your child:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Boosting Self-Esteem</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Writing a letter allows you to express your feelings towards your child and highlight their accomplishments. This is a great way to build their self-esteem and make them feel loved and appreciated.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Preserving Memories</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Letters are a tangible way to capture memories and milestones. When your child reads these letters years later, they will be able to relive those special moments and memories that were shared.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Improving Communication</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Letter writing is a great way to improve communication between you and your child. It allows you both to express your thoughts and feelings in a thoughtful and meaningful way. This can help strengthen your relationship and create a deeper connection.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>As a child, I loved receiving letters from my grandmother. She wrote to me regularly, sharing stories about her childhood and life experiences. These letters meant so much to me and I still have them today, as a reminder of the special bond we shared.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Similarly, one of my friends writes letters to her children on their birthdays, highlighting their accomplishments and expressing her love and pride. She tells me that this tradition has helped her build a stronger connection with her children and has given them something special to look forward to every year.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, while extravagant birthday parties are great, sometimes the most meaningful gifts are the ones that come from the heart. Kim Kardashian's letter writing tradition is a simple yet powerful way to create a special memory for your child. By boosting their self-esteem, preserving memories, and improving communication, you can create a lasting bond with your child that they will cherish forever.</p>
