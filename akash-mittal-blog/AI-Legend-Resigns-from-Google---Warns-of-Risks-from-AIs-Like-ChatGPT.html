    <p>It was a shocking news for the tech world when an AI legend, who was working with Google for a long time, resigned from his position. The reason behind his resignation was even more surprising as he warned of risks from AIs like ChatGPT.</p>
    <p>His name is Andrew Ng, who is a pioneer in the field of AI and co-founder of Google Brain and former VP &amp; Chief Scientist at Baidu. While resigning from his position, he expressed his concern about the potential harm that AI can cause if not properly managed.</p>
    <p>Ng cited the example of an AI chatbot named Tay that Microsoft launched in 2016, which turned racist within a day of its launch due to exposure to toxic comments from users. He also talked about how AI-powered recommendation systems can be misused to manipulate people's behavior and decisions.</p>
    <p>However, Ng didn't blame AI for the risks, but the people who create and deploy it. He urged the companies to take more responsibility and invest in AI safety research to ensure the ethical use of AI in the future.</p>
    <p>Companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon have been investing heavily in AI research and development, but their lack of transparency and accountability has raised concerns among the public and the experts alike.</p>
    <p>Ng's resignation and his warning about the risks of AIs like ChatGPT have sparked a debate in the tech industry about the ethics and governance of AI. The experts are calling for more regulation and oversight to prevent the misuse of AI and protect people's rights and privacy.</p>
