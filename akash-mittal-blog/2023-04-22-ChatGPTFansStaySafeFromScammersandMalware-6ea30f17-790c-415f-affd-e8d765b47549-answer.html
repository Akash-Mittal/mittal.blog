    <h2>A Cautionary Tale</h2>
    <p>It was a Sunday afternoon, and Sarah was scrolling through her social media feed when she came across an ad for a ChatGPT giveaway. All she had to do was enter her email address, and she could win a brand new iPhone. Excited at the prospect of winning the latest phone, Sarah entered her email address without thinking twice. Within minutes, she received a pop-up message informing her that she had won the giveaway and needed to click on a link to claim her prize.</p>
    <p>Without hesitation, Sarah clicked on the link, only to be redirected to a page asking for her credit card details. Confused and suspicious, Sarah tried to exit out of the page, but her computer froze. Before she knew it, Sarah had unknowingly installed malware onto her computer, which gave cybercriminals access to her personal data.</p>
    <p>After this experience, Sarah realized the importance of a defensive mindset when it comes to online safety, especially when it comes to scammers and malware.</p>

    <h2>Concrete Examples</h2>
    <ol>
     <li><strong>Watch out for giveaways:</strong> Many scammers lure people in with the promise of a giveaway or prize. Be wary of any offers that seem too good to be true, and never provide your personal information unless you trust the source.</li>
     <li><strong>Be cautious of unknown links:</strong> Malware can be installed through a variety of methods, including downloading attachments, clicking on links, or visiting suspicious websites. Think twice before clicking on any links or downloading any files from unknown sources, and always make sure your antivirus software is up-to-date.</li>
     <li><strong>Don't trust unsolicited emails:</strong> Phishing attacks can be especially dangerous, as they often appear to come from a trusted source, like your bank or social media account. Be cautious of emails that ask you to provide personal information, and always double-check the sender's email address before replying.</li>
    </ol>
