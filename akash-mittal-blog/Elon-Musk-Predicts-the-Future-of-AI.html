     <h2>Introduction</h2>
     <p>Elon Musk, a man known for his work in SpaceX and Tesla, is also an outspoken advocate for the responsible development of artificial intelligence, or AI. In fact, he has gone on record many times saying that AI and machine learning pose an existential threat to humanity. In this article, we examine Musk's past comments and present his predictions and ideas on what the future of AI technology could look like.</p>

     <h2>Background</h2>
     <p>Musk's thoughts on AI are not without merit. As technology continues to advance at a rapid pace, more researchers are beginning to dive into the world of artificial intelligence. The problem with creating AI that TikToks or plays chess is that it takes a lot of data to learn. With AI capable of learning from vast amounts of data, the systems are at risk of becoming dangerous in the future. In fact, Musk has even likened the development of AI to "summoning the demon."</p>
