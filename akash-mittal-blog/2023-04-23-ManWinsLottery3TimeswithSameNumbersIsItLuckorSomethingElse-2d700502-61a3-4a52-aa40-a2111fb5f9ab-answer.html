   <p>Imagine winning the lottery once - it's a dream come true for many people. Now, imagine winning it twice. That's almost too good to be true. But winning it not just twice, but three times with the same set of numbers? That's exactly what happened to a man in the United States.</p>
   <p>According to WITN, a television news station in North Carolina, the man's luck started in 2012 when he won a $1 million prize in the Powerball lottery. A year later, he won the exact same amount with the same set of numbers. And in 2018, he won another $1 million in the same game.</p>
   <p>Naturally, people were stunned and started wondering how this was possible. Was it just sheer luck, or was there something else going on behind the scenes?</p>
   <p>Experts say that winning the lottery is all about odds and probability. The chances of winning any lottery game are usually slim to none, but they can vary depending on the game and the number of participants. For example, the odds of winning the Powerball lottery are approximately 1 in 292 million.</p>
   <p>But getting the same winning numbers three times in a row? That's a different story. Some experts argue that there's no real explanation for this, other than pure luck. Others suggest that there may be some sort of pattern or algorithm that the man used, possibly unconsciously, to increase his chances of winning.</p>
   <p>Regardless of the method, the fact remains that the man did win three times with the same numbers. And while some may call it luck, others may simply see it as a statistical anomaly.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Winning the lottery is all about odds and probability.</li>
    <li>Getting the same winning numbers three times in a row is extremely rare.</li>
    <li>Whether it's luck or something else, the man's story is definitely one for the books.</li>
