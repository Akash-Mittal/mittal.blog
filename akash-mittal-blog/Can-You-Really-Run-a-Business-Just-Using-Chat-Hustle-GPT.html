    <p>Picture this. You're launching a business and instead of creating a website, hiring staff, and setting up a physical shop, you do everything through chat. You use chat to market your products, sell to customers, and handle customer service requests. Sounds too good to be true? Well, it's not.</p>
    <p>Chat has become a powerful tool for entrepreneurs looking to start their own business with minimal investment. With the rise of messaging apps like WhatsApp, Messenger, and WeChat, it's becoming easier than ever to reach customers where they already are - on their smartphones.</p>
    <p>But can you really run an entire business just using chat? Let's take a look at some quantifiable examples.</p>
   </section>
   <section>
    
    <p>One of the most famous examples of a business run entirely on chat is China's WeChat. The messaging app has over 1 billion users and offers a range of services beyond just messaging, including payments, shopping, and travel booking. According to a report by McKinsey, WeChat has contributed to the creation of over $200 billion in transactions and over 20 million jobs in China.</p>
    <p>Another example is Indian e-commerce platform, Shop101. The company allows users to create their own virtual shops and sell products through WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. The platform has over 700,000 registered resellers and has raised over $11 million in funding.</p>
    <p>Finally, there's startup Magic, which promises to handle any task a user sends them via SMS. The company says it can do anything from booking flights to scheduling appointments to researching products. Magic charges users per task and has raised over $12 million in funding.</p>

    <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
    <p>To successfully run a business using chat, there are a few practical tips you should keep in mind:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Choose the right platform - not all messaging apps are created equal. Consider your target audience and choose a platform that they are likely to be using.</li>
     <li>Be responsive - chat is all about instant communication. Make sure you respond to messages quickly and efficiently.</li>
     <li>Use chatbots - chatbots can help automate some of the more repetitive tasks of running a business through chat. They can handle simple customer service requests and help customers find what they're looking for.</li>
    </ol>

However, it's important to keep in mind that chat should be used as a supplement to your overall business strategy, not as a replacement for it. By following some practical tips, you can use chat to improve your business and reach customers where they are - on their smartphones.</p>
