   <h1>Slovak Businesses Turn to India to Plug Worker Shortages</h1> <img src="images/Slovak-Businesses-Turn-to-India-to-Plug-Worker-Shortages.jpeg" alt="+Slovak-Businesses-Turn-to-India-to-Plug-Worker-Shortages+">
   <h2>The Story</h2> When Peter Kral, the CEO of a small Slovak engineering firm, was struggling to find enough workers to meet demand, he turned to an unlikely source: India. Kral had heard that India had a large pool of skilled workers eager for opportunities abroad, and he decided to take a chance and looked for a partner there. After a few weeks of searching, he found a company in Bangalore that specialized in IT and engineering staffing, and they quickly struck a deal. Within months, Kral had a steady stream of Indian workers coming to Slovakia to work for his company, bringing new skills and fresh perspectives into the office. Kral says that the partnership has been a great success, and that he will continue to look to India as a source of talent. And Kral is not alone. Many Slovak companies are struggling to find enough workers to meet demand, particularly in fields like engineering, IT, and healthcare. To solve this problem, they are increasingly turning to India and other countries with large pools of skilled workers to fill the gaps. 
    According to data from the World Economic Forum, Slovakia has one of the lowest levels of labor force participation in Europe, with just 65.2% of working-age people in the workforce. This makes it difficult for businesses in the country to find enough workers to meet demand. At the same time, India has one of the largest pools of skilled workers in the world, with more than 3 million engineers graduating each year. Many of these workers are eager to work abroad and take advantage of new opportunities. As a result, more and more Slovak businesses are turning to India to plug worker shortages. For example: - The Slovak branch of T-Systems, a German IT services company, has partnered with an Indian staffing agency to bring in Indian workers for IT projects in Slovakia. - The Slovak government has signed a memorandum of understanding with India to promote cooperation in the IT and engineering sectors. - The Slovak steel company U.S. Steel has partnered with an Indian engineering firm to bring in Indian engineers to work in its Slovak plant.

   <h2> and Practical Tips</h2> Peter Kral's experience with hiring Indian workers is just one example of how collaboration between Slovakia and India can benefit both countries. Kral says that the Indian workers he has hired have brought new skills and fresh perspectives to his company, and that he would not have been able to grow his business without them. For Slovak companies looking to hire workers from India, Kral recommends doing proper research and due diligence before signing any contracts. It's important to find a reliable partner who can help with the bureaucratic and logistical aspects of hiring foreign workers, and to ensure that the workers have the necessary visas and paperwork to work legally in Slovakia.
