  <p>Imagine a world where there are no chatbots. You have to call customer support for every small query, wait on hold for a long time, and then talk to someone who may or may not be able to help you. Sounds frustrating, right? Well, this was the world before the advent of chatbots. Today, chatbots are an integral part of customer support in many industries, but the question is, who debuted first, Bard or ChatGPT?</p>
  <p>The answer to this question lies in the timeline of events. Bard, a chatbot developed by Assist, debuted in late 2015, while ChatGPT, a chatbot developed by GPT, debuted in early 2016. Bard was designed specifically for the healthcare industry, where it helped patients to communicate with their doctors, schedule appointments, and get the necessary information about their health. On the other hand, ChatGPT was a general-purpose chatbot that could be used in various industries, such as finance, retail, and travel.</p>
  <p>Bard's debut was a remarkable success, and it revolutionized the healthcare industry. Its ability to provide personalized care to patients was unparalleled, and it saved doctors a lot of time by automating the appointment scheduling process. According to a study by Accenture, chatbots like Bard could save the healthcare industry up to $150 billion per year by 2026.</p>
  <p>Similarly, ChatGPT also made a mark in the industry. It was designed to be a chatbot that could understand natural language and provide accurate responses. It was particularly useful in the financial industry, where customers could interact with it to get investment advice, portfolio analysis, and other financial services. ChatGPT also saved a lot of time for financial institutions by automating the customer support process.</p>
  <p>So, who debuted first, Bard or ChatGPT? The answer is clear, Bard debuted before ChatGPT, but both chatbots played a significant role in revolutionizing the industry. Today, companies like Intercom and Drift are using chatbots to enhance customer experience and save time for their employees.</p>
