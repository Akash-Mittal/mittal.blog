  <h1>A Study Finds ChatGPT Struggles with Public Health Referrals</h1></br> <img src="images/ChatGPT-Struggles-with-Public-Health-Referrals.jpeg" alt="+ChatGPT-Struggles-with-Public-Health-Referrals+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/study-finds-chatgpt-struggles-with-public-health-referrals/" target="_blank" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/study-finds-chatgpt-struggles-with-public-health-referrals/" rel="noopener">https://www.cbsnews.com/video/study-finds-chatgpt-struggles-with-public-health-referrals/</a></span></h5>
  <p>Once upon a time, a woman was feeling ill and decided to seek medical advice from ChatGPT. She described her symptoms, and ChatGPT provided a few recommendations. However, the woman found the advice unhelpful, and her condition worsened. She then sought a medical professional's help, who correctly diagnosed her and provided appropriate treatment. This story is not unique. A recent study revealed that ChatGPT struggles with public health referrals.</p>
  <p>ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence-enabled chatbot that helps people with various queries. Many people use it to seek health advice, but the study found that ChatGPT is not always effective in directing people to appropriate public health resources. The study, conducted by a group of researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of California, San Francisco, evaluated ChatGPT's performance in responding to public health referrals.</p>
  <p>The study analyzed the data of 500 conversations between ChatGPT and users who sought public health information. The researchers found that ChatGPT provided appropriate public health information in only 30% of the conversations. Moreover, ChatGPT referred users to incorrect resources in 43% of conversations, including sites that were not related to public health or where users have to pay for services. Furthermore, ChatGPT failed to provide any reference information in about 20% of conversations.</p>
  <p>For example, a user sought information about COVID-19 testing centers in their area. ChatGPT provided a link to a commercial laboratory service where the user would have to pay for testing. The correct information would have been free testing sites provided by the government. In another instance, a user sought information about affordable health insurance. ChatGPT referred the user to commercial insurance brokers, whereas the correct information would have been Affordable Care Act (ACA) insurance plans provided by the government.</p>
  <h2>Reasons for ChatGPT's Ineffectiveness</h2>
  <p>ChatGPT's suboptimal performance can be attributed to several reasons:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>Data Inadequacy:</strong> ChatGPT's responses are based on the data available to it, and public health information is continuously changing. ChatGPT may not be able to provide correct information because of this.</li>
   <li><strong>Incorrect Programming:</strong> ChatGPT is programmed to look for keywords in user questions and provide responses. If the user's choice of words or phrases is ambiguous or unclear, ChatGPT may not understand what the user is trying to ask.</li>
   <li><strong>No Conversation Memory:</strong> ChatGPT doesn't remember previous conversations with a user and cannot tailor responses based on earlier interactions. This lack of continuity limits ChatGPT's ability to guide users to appropriate resources accurately.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Based on the study's findings, it's essential to recognize that ChatGPT may not always provide users with accurate or helpful public health referrals. However, as an artificial intelligence chatbot, ChatGPT also has its benefits as a health information resource.</p>
  <p>The study's authors suggest that public health organizations should work with the developers of tools like ChatGPT to ensure that users receive accurate referrals. This may involve improving the tool's ability to understand user queries or updating the tool's information database regularly.</p>
  <p>Key Takeaways from the study and Conclusions:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>ChatGPT struggles with public health referrals and provides appropriate information only 30% of the time.</li>
   <li>Reasons for ChatGPT's inefficiency include data inadequacy, incorrect programming, and no conversation memory.</li>
   <li>Public health organizations should work with developers to improve chatbot performance in providing accurate referrals.</li>
  </ol>
