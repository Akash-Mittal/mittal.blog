    <h3>A personal story</h3>
    <p>When I was just starting out in the VC world, I made a rookie mistake. I invested heavily in an industry that I thought had a bright future, only to see it completely disrupted by a new technology. I lost a lot of money, and it taught me an important lesson: always stay ahead of the curve.</p>
    <p>That's why, when I started hearing about Web3, I knew I had to learn more. I started researching the technology, talking to experts, and reading up on the latest developments. And what I found convinced me that investing in Web3 is not just a good idea, but a necessary one.</p>

    <h3>What is Web3?</h3>
    <p>Web3, also known as the decentralized web, is the next evolution of the internet. It's built on blockchain technology, which means it's completely decentralized and transparent.

     <li>Decentralized storage solutions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are just a few examples of the many applications of Web3. The possibilities are endless, and we're only scratching the surface of what's possible.</p>
