  <h2>Story</h2> Jane is a small business owner who relies on Amazon Web Services (AWS) for her online store. On a typical Monday morning, she received several calls from her customers complaining about the slow loading time and error messages on her website. She quickly realized that her website was down, and it was not just herâ€”it was a widespread issue affecting thousands of AWS users worldwide. 
  <h2>Examples</h2> Jane's experience is just one of the many incidents that happened during the AWS outage on November 25, 2019. According to AWS's status page, the outage started at 2:37 AM Pacific Time and affected services like Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Simple Storage Service (S3), and Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS). Users globally were unable to access their websites, files, and data stored on AWS, leading to significant disruptions in their businesses. For instance, popular mobile application, Robinhood, which allows users to buy and sell stocks, was down for almost the entire trading day. The outage also affected other popular services like social media platform GroupMe, news site The Philadelphia Inquirer and even some government websites. 
  <h2> and Case Studies</h2> Jessica, a freelance writer, lost her entire work portfolio stored on AWS during the outage. She had not backed up her files, and due to the lack of access to her account, she was unable to retrieve them for several days. This incident taught her a valuable lesson about the importance of backing up her data in multiple locations. Samantha is an online business owner who lost a significant amount of revenue due to the outage. Because her website was down for almost the entire day, she lost out on potential customers and sales. She later found out that if she had set up an alternative cloud provider, she could have avoided these losses. 
  <h2>Conclusion</h2> The AWS outage of 2019 highlights the importance of having a disaster recovery plan in place. Here are three crucial points to consider: 1. Back up your data in multiple locations to avoid losing important files. 2. Set up an alternative cloud provider to avoid significant disruptions to your business. 3. Always be prepared for the unexpected by having a disaster recovery plan in place.
