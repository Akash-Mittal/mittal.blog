    <p>Teddy DAO auctioned off a variety of NFTs, including artwork, collectibles, and even access tokens to exclusive events and community perks. The auctions were held every day, and each NFT was sold to the highest bidder. The money raised from these auctions was used to fund various social impact projects, including education, health, environment, and technology.</p>
    <p>One of the most popular NFTs auctioned by Teddy DAO was a digital painting of a teddy bear created by a famous artist. The NFT sold for a whopping 10 ETH, making it one of the highest-grossing NFTs on the platform.
