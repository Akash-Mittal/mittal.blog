  <p>Web 3.0, also known as the Semantic Web, promises to be the next evolution of the internet, one that is focused on more intelligent and personalized interactions between users and machines. As part of efforts to support this technology, the Telangana government has set up a regulatory sandbox to encourage innovation and collaboration in the sector. And now, Liminal, a leading technology company, has been invited to be part of the advisory panel for the project.</p>
  <h2>A Story to Start With</h2>
  <p>Jasmine was a young entrepreneur with a deep interest in tech. She had long been intrigued by the possibilities of Web 3.0 and the ways in which it might transform the internet as we know it. However, despite her passion, she found it difficult to navigate the complex regulatory landscape that surrounded the technology. That was until she discovered the Telangana government's Web 3.0 regulatory sandbox, which gave her the space and support she needed to experiment and innovate without fear of legal repercussions.</p>
  <p>With the guidance and expertise of Liminal and other advisory panel members, Jasmine was able to develop groundbreaking web applications that could better understand user needs and deliver more tailored experiences. Her projects showed how Web 3.0 could help bridge the gap between humans and machines, creating truly intelligent systems that could improve our lives in meaningful ways.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Web 3.0 Applications</h2>
  <p>So, what exactly are some of the concrete applications that Web 3.0 might enable? Here are a few examples:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>Personalized recommendations:</strong> Web 3.0 technology could allow for a more sophisticated understanding of user preferences, leading to more accurate and helpful recommendations for products, services, and even content like articles or videos.</li>
   <li><strong>Smart contracts:</strong> Blockchain technology, a key component of Web 3.0, could revolutionize the way that contracts and agreements are made and enforced, allowing for greater efficiency, transparency, and security.</li>
   <li><strong>Virtual assistants:</strong> As AI and natural language processing continue to improve, Web 3.0 could make virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa even smarter and more intuitive, with the ability to understand and respond to more complex requests.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2></h2>
  <p>What does all of this mean for the future of the internet and the tech industry? Here are three key takeaways:</p>
