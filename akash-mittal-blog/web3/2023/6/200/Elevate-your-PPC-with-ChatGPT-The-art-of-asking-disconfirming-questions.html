   <h2>A Story of Success</h2>
   <p>When I was first starting out in the PPC industry, I struggled to get the results that my clients wanted. I spent hours upon hours tweaking my campaigns, crafting the perfect ad copy, and optimizing my landing pages, but I just couldn't seem to get the conversions that I was after. I was about to give up when I stumbled upon a technique that would change everything - the art of asking disconfirming questions.</p>

    <h3>What are disconfirming questions?</h3>
    <p>Disconfirming questions are questions that challenge assumptions or beliefs that someone holds. In the context of PPC advertising, they are questions that you ask your clients or customers that challenge their assumptions about their target audience, their product or service, or their overall marketing strategy. By asking these types of questions, you can get your clients to think outside of the box and come up with new and innovative solutions to their problems.</p>

    <h3>Why are disconfirming questions important in PPC advertising?</h3>
    <p>Disconfirming questions are important in PPC advertising because they can help you to identify and address the underlying issues that are preventing your campaigns from being successful. They can also help you to uncover new opportunities that you may not have considered before. By challenging your client's assumptions and beliefs, you can help them to approach their marketing strategy with a fresh perspective and come up with new and innovative ideas.</p>
    <p>For example, if you're working with a client who is struggling to get conversions on their website, you might ask them questions like "What assumptions are you making about your target audience? Are there any segments of your audience that you may be overlooking?" or "What makes your product or service unique? How can you communicate that value proposition more effectively?" By asking these types of questions, you can help your client to identify and address the underlying issues that are preventing them from achieving their goals.</p>

    <h3>Examples of disconfirming questions</h3>
    <ul>
     <li>What assumptions are you making about your target audience?</li>
     <li>What objections might your customers have to your product or service?</li>
     <li>What makes your product or service different from your competitors?</li>
     <li>What metrics are you using to measure the success of your campaigns?</li>
     <li>What are the biggest challenges that your industry is facing right now?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As you can see, these questions are meant to challenge your client's assumptions and beliefs about their marketing strategy. By asking these types of questions, you can help your client to approach their marketing strategy with a fresh perspective and come up with new and innovative ideas.</p>

    <h3>Personal anecdote</h3>
    <p>One of my favorite personal anecdotes about the power of disconfirming questions comes from working with a client in the travel industry. They had been struggling to get bookings on their website and had tried all of the usual tactics like optimizing their ad copy and landing pages. However, nothing seemed to be working.</p>
    <p>During one of our strategy sessions, I asked them a series of disconfirming questions like "What assumptions are you making about your target audience?" and "What makes your product unique compared to your competitors?" They realized that they had been assuming that their target audience was mainly families with young kids, when in fact there was a significant segment of older couples looking for romantic getaways. They also realized that their product was unique because they focused on "off the beaten path" destinations that were not typically offered by other travel companies.</p>
    <p>After making some changes to their marketing strategy based on our conversation, they saw a significant increase in bookings - particularly from the older couples segment. By challenging their assumptions and beliefs, we were able to help them identify a new target market and better communicate their unique value proposition.</p>
