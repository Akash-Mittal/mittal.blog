    <h2>A Story</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time, I used to check my horoscope in magazines every month. I would eagerly wait for the new issue to arrive, so I could read my horoscope predictions. However, as time passed by, I began losing interest in those horoscopes. Eventually, I found out about ChatGPT, an AI-powered chatbot that claims to predict your future based on your birth chart. I was skeptical at first, but I decided to give it a shot.</p>

    <h2>What is ChatGPT?</h2>
    <p>ChatGPT is an AI-powered chatbot that uses astrology to predict your future. It claims to be more accurate than traditional horoscopes because it uses your birth chart to analyze the positions of the stars and planets at the time of your birth. A birth chart is a map of the positions of the stars and planets at the time of your birth, and it is believed that these positions can influence your personality and destiny.</p>
    <p>ChatGPT asks for your birth details and generates a personalized birth chart. You can then chat with the chatbot and ask it questions about your future. The chatbot analyzes your birth chart and provides you with personalized predictions.</p>
