    <p>Imagine yourself sitting in a hospital room, waiting for your doctor to arrive and provide you with a diagnosis for your recent symptoms. You are anxious and scared, but you trust your doctor to make the right decision for your health. As you wait, you see a small robot with a screen walking towards you. The robot stops next to you and starts asking you questions about your condition. You feel uncomfortable, but you answer the questions honestly. After a few minutes, the robot shows you a diagnosis that looks different from what you expected. You start to panic, but when your doctor arrives, he assures you that the robot's diagnosis was incorrect, and he provides you with a more accurate one.</p>
    <p>This scenario is an example of the growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the healthcare industry. AI can help doctors and nurses provide better care to their patients by analyzing huge amounts of data and identifying patterns that are not visible to the human eye. However, AI is not infallible, and its decisions can have a huge impact on people's lives, which is why there is a need for regulation to ensure its ethical use.</p>

    <h3>House Member's New Legislation on AI</h3>
    <p>In April 2021, US Representative Robin Kelly introduced a new bipartisan legislation called the "Future of Artificial Intelligence Act". The act aims to regulate AI and ensure that its use is ethical, transparent, and accountable. It also establishes a national AI strategy and creates an advisory committee to advise on AI policy and strategy. The bill has gained support from both Democrats and Republicans, as they recognized the need for AI regulation to protect the public's rights and prevent companies from abusing AI for their benefit.</p>

    <h3>Why Regulating AI is Necessary</h3>
    <p>AI has the potential to change our lives for the better, but it also poses significant risks if not used ethically. Here are some reasons why regulating AI is necessary:</p>
    <ul>
     <li><strong>Bias in AI:</strong> AI algorithms can be biased if they are developed using biased data or without considering diverse perspectives. Biased AI can perpetuate existing societal inequalities and harm marginalized groups.</li>
     <li><strong>Privacy Concerns:</strong> AI can collect and store massive amounts of personal data, which can be used to infringe on people's privacy and civil liberties if not adequately protected.</li>
     <li><strong>Unpredictability:</strong> Some AI systems can make decisions that are unpredictable or difficult to understand, even for their developers. This lack of transparency can be problematic, especially if AI is used to make critical decisions that affect people's lives.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Examples of Unethical Use of AI</h3>
    <p>Here are some examples of how AI has been used unethically in recent years:</p>
    <ol>
     <li><strong>Facial Recognition:</strong> Facial recognition technology has been used to surveil people, particularly in Black and Brown neighborhoods, without their consent or knowledge. This has led to false arrests and wrongful accusations.</li>
     <li><strong>Hiring Algorithms:</strong> AI algorithms have been used in hiring processes to screen candidates based on their resumes or online profiles. However, these algorithms can be biased against women, people of color, and individuals with disabilities.</li>
     <li><strong>Criminal Justice:</strong> AI has been used to predict future criminal activity in some US states, which can lead to a disproportionate number of arrests and incarceration for people from marginalized communities.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <ol>
     <li>AI has the potential to improve our lives, but it must be used ethically and responsibly.</li>
     <li>Regulating AI is necessary to prevent biased, unpredictable, or harmful use of AI and protect people's rights and privacy.</li>
     <li>The introduction of new bipartisan legislation on regulating AI is a positive step towards ensuring the ethical use of AI and establishing accountability for companies and organizations using AI.</li>
