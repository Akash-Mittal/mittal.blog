  <p>Once upon a time, people used to call local directories to get things done or to find the information they needed. Then came search engines, which provided us with almost any information we needed at our fingertips. Today, we have AI-powered chatbots, which, through natural language understanding, are transforming the way we interact with the internet.</p>
  <p>Today, almost every business is offering chatbots to help their customers, but not all chatbots are created equal. OpenAI's GPT is one of the most advanced chatbots on the market designed to understand complex human language and provide intelligent responses.</p>
  <p>Recently, OpenAI upgraded its chatbot, GPT-3, and made it capable of searching the web, but only through Microsoft's search engine Bing. This new feature is a game-changer in the way we interact with chatbots and search engines. Let's have a look at what this new feature means for OpenAI's chatbot and its users.</p>
  <h2>What it means for OpenAI's Chatbot and Its Users</h2>
  <p>As we know, Chatbots are powered by various AI algorithms that help them understand human language, interpret the user's intent, and offer the best possible response. Until now, these chatbots were confined to providing routine assistance and information available in their database.</p>
  <p>But, by adding the search capability, OpenAI's GPT-3 can now tap into the vastness of the internet and provide more precise and relevant answers to its users. Users no longer need to leave the chat window or open a search engine to find the solution to their problem. They can ask the chatbot the questions and obtain the answers instantly.</p>
  <p>For example, if a user wants to purchase a new laptop, they can ask the chatbot about the best deals in the market, and GPT-3 will provide them with the relevant links to the best deals, specifications, and reviews of that product. Also, the chatbot can assist in several other things, such as booking an appointment, creating a reminder, checking flight status, weather, and much more.</p>
  <h2>Limitations of GPT-3's Search Capability</h2>
  <p>Although OpenAI's GPT-3 is an advanced chatbot capable of understanding complex human language, it still has some limitations. For instance:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>It only uses Microsoft's Bing search engine. While Bing may be a powerful search engine, it's not the only search engine people use. Therefore, users might miss some useful information that other search engines might provide.</li>
   <li>GPT-3 can't filter out fake news or potential bias on the sources it finds.</li>
   <li>It can't describe the individual elements of the search results, such as the importance, relevance, or authority of each search results.</li>
   <li>It isn't 100% conversational. For advanced queries, users would need to write more text, making them feel like they're searching the web instead, just within the chatbot interface.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, the ability of OpenAI's GPT-3 to search the web via Bing is a great leap forward in the chatbot industry. With the help of this new feature, users can save time, effort, and hassle looking for information on different search engines and websites. Our experience with AI chatbots will take a significant leap forward and enhance our interaction with technology.</p>
  <p>However, the existing limitations of the feature should be addressed to enhance the overall user experience and ensure the provision of more accurate and reliable information.</p>
  <h3>Pro Tips:</h3>
  <ul>
   <li>Test the chatbot's capabilities before relying on it entirely.</li>
   <li>Don't rely entirely on a single source or a search engine, always have multiple sources with primary sources when possible.</li>
   <li>Understand that GPT-3 is not entirely conversational, and some queries may require more input to receive the best results.</li>
  </ul>
