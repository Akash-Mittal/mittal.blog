    <h2>The Dark Web and Stolen Payment Cards</h2>
    <p>The dark web is a hidden network that requires specific software, configurations, or authorizations to access, and it allows people to carry out illegal activities without the fear of getting caught. One such illegal activity is the buying and selling of stolen payment cards.</p>
    <p>According to a report by Gemini Advisory, a cybersecurity firm that monitors the dark web for stolen card information, six million stolen payment cards were recently discovered on the dark web. These cards belonged to customers of various international banks, and the data was obtained through different methods such as phishing, malware, and skimming.</p>
    <p>This data breach not only affects the customers of these banks but also the banks themselves. The banks are now facing lawsuits and reputational damage due to security failures that allowed this data breach to occur.</p>
