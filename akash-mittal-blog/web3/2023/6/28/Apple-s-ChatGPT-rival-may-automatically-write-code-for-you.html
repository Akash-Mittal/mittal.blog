    <h2>What is Apple's ChatGPT Rival?</h2>
    <p>For those who are unfamiliar with ChatGPT, it's a language model developed by OpenAI. The technology uses artificial intelligence to generate human-like responses to written text. ChatGPT is being used in chatbots, virtual assistants, and other similar applications.</p>
    <p>Apple's ChatGPT rival is a similar technology being developed by Apple. According to reports, it has the ability to automatically generate code for developers, which could transform the way software development is done.</p>
    <p>This technology can generate code in different programming languages, including Swift and Objective-C. Apple's ChatGPT rival could be used to help developers write code faster, reduce errors, and improve the overall quality of the code.</p>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Examples of Apple's ChatGPT Rival in Action</h2>
    <p>There are no current examples of how Apple's ChatGPT rival works, as it's still under development. However, such technology is not new to the market. There are similar tools and libraries available for developers to generate code.</p>
    <p>For example, SnippetsLab is a code snippets manager that allows developers to store and organize code snippets. Developers can use this tool to copy and paste code snippets into their projects, which makes it faster and more efficient to write code.</p>
    <p>Another tool, Code templates, is a feature of many different Integrated Development Environments (IDE). Code templates allow developers to select code segments or functions and generate code automatically. This feature is used to generate repetitive code segments, making application development faster and more efficient.</p>
