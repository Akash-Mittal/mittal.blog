    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>It was a typical evening at the comedy club when the night's headliner, Maria Bamford, decided to do something different. Instead of performing her usual stand-up routine, she invited a special guest to join her on stage: an artificial intelligence chatbot called ChatGPT.</p>
    <p>The audience was hesitant at first, not sure what to expect from a robotic comedian. But soon they were laughing along with ChatGPT's jokes and puns, amazed at how human-like the AI's humor was.</p>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>ChatGPT is just one example of how AI is being used to create content that is both informative and entertaining. Shows like "The Late Late Show" with James Corden have used AI to generate new comedy sketches, while companies like Botnik Studios are using AI to create everything from poetry to music albums.</p>
    <p>And it's not just professional comedians who are tapping into the power of AI. With chatbots like Replika and Wysa, people can have conversations with AI that are meant to be funny and lighthearted, providing a brief escape from the stresses of everyday life.</p>
    <p>But with all this new technology, it's important to ask ourselves: are we laughing with AI, or at it? While AI-generated humor can be impressive, it can also fall flat or even offend. Just like with human comedy, there's a fine line between being funny and being inappropriate.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>AI is changing the way we consume and create entertainment, and its potential for humor is no exception.</li>
     <li>While AI-generated humor can be impressive and entertaining, it's important to remember that it's not perfect and can still fall flat or offend.</li>
     <li>As we continue to explore the power of AI in comedy, we must navigate the challenges that come with it and ensure that technology doesn't replace the heart and soul of human humor.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So the next time you find yourself laughing at a joke from an AI chatbot or comedy sketch, ask yourself: am I laughing with it, or at it?</p>
