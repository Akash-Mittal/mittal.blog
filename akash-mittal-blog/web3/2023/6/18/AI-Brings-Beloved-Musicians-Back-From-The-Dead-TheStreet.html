   <h2>The Story</h2>
   <p>Imagine you're at a concert, and the band announces that they have a special guest performer - the late great John Lennon. You might assume that you're in store for a tribute act or hologram of the former Beatle, but that's not the case anymore. Thanks to artificial intelligence (AI) technology, beloved musicians like Lennon are being brought back to life, both on stage and in the recording studio.</p>
   <p>It all started with the 2012 Coachella music festival, where a life-sized hologram of the late rapper Tupac Shakur performed alongside Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. Though the hologram was just a projection, it was a groundbreaking moment for the world of music and technology. Fast forward to the present day and advancements in AI technology have made it possible for musicians to be digitally resurrected with stunning accuracy.</p>

   <h2>Examples of AI in Music</h2>
   <h3>1. The Beatles Reunite for a new Album</h3>
   <p>In 2015, a new album by The Beatles entitled "The Staff of Moses" was released. The catch? It featured two new songs by the band, with a twist - all four members had been brought back to life using AI technology. The songs had been created using old demos and recordings featuring the Fab Four, with the AI filling in the gaps in their performances to create a seamless sound.</p>
   <h3>2. Roy Orbison Tours the UK</h3>
   <p>In 2018, legendary singer Roy Orbison went on tour across the UK, backed by a live orchestra. The only difference? Orbison himself had passed away in 1988. The Orbison hologram was created by a company called Hologram USA, which uses AI technology to create life-like projections of deceased celebrities.</p>
   <h3>3. Whitney Houston's Duet with Christina Aguilera</h3>
   <p>In 2019, during an episode of "The Voice", Christina Aguilera performed a duet of "I Will Always Love You" with none other than Whitney Houston - or at least, a hologram of her. The performance was made possible using AI technology to recreate Houston's singing and appearance, allowing her to perform alongside Aguilera as if she were still alive.</p>
