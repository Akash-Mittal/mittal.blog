   <p>Imagine a world where artificial intelligence (AI) has the power to control our lives, careers, and even our daily routines. Sounds dystopian, right? But the truth is, we are already living in such a world. As AI becomes increasingly present in our daily lives, we are forced to ask the question: who gets to set the AI agenda?</p>
   <p>The question is not just a matter of technology; it incorporates social, ethical, and moral considerations. AI is not just a tool for the tech-savvy and the elite; it has the potential to impact almost all aspects of our lives, particularly those of the marginalized communities. Hence, it is critical to have an inclusive conversation about AI that includes all stakeholders and considers the diverse perspectives.</p>
   <h2>Examples of AI agenda-setting</h2>
   <p>Let's take a look at some of the ways in which AI has already been used to either further certain agendas or counter them:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The use of facial recognition technology in law enforcement: While facial recognition technology may seem like a useful tool for catching criminals, its biased and discriminatory nature has raised concerns about its misuse to target specific communities, particularly non-white and marginalized individuals. Law enforcement agencies have a responsibility to ensure that the technology is used ethically and responsibly.</li>
    <li>The use of AI in hiring decisions: AI-powered hiring tools may seem like a fair way to eliminate hiring bias, but research has shown that they can perpetuate existing inequalities. For example, algorithms may be trained on data sets that reflect existing hiring biases, leading to the uneven representation of certain groups in the workforce. As AI takes over more hiring decisions, it is critical to ensure that it does not reinforce discrimination.</li>
    <li>The use of AI in healthcare: AI has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by improving diagnosis, treatment, and patient outcomes. However, the use of AI in healthcare also raises ethical questions around privacy, consent, and bias. For instance, an AI system may be trained on data that reflects systemic biases, leading to inaccurate or discriminatory diagnoses. Healthcare professionals and policymakers must ensure that AI is used for the benefit of all patients with equal access to care and treatment.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>The importance of an inclusive AI conversation</h2>
   <p>So, who gets to set the AI agenda? At present, the answer may seem to be a select group of tech executives, policymakers, and academics who are primarily white and male. However, there is growing recognition of the importance of involving diverse perspectives and voices in the AI conversation.</p>
   <p>An inclusive AI conversation involves not just the participation of diverse stakeholders but also the recognition of their unique experiences and knowledge. For example, incorporating the perspective of someone who has experienced discrimination or bias due to their race, ethnicity, gender, or disability can provide insights into the ethical implications of AI and solutions to mitigate their negative impact.</p>
   <p>When marginalized communities and other stakeholders are excluded from the AI conversation, we risk the perpetuation of existing power structures and biases. This is particularly dangerous given AI's potential to amplify existing inequalities and further marginalize already vulnerable populations. Hence, an inclusive AI conversation is not just a moral imperative but also a practical necessity.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, the AI conversation must be inclusive, diverse, and equitable. The significance of AI extends beyond technology; it denotes social, ethical, and moral considerations that affect us all. By involving diverse perspectives, we can ensure that AI is designed and implemented in ways that benefit society as a whole, with equity, fairness, and justice at its core.</p>
