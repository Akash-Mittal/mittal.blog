  <p>It was a hot summer day in New York City. Marie, a young professional, decided to take a walk in Central Park during her lunch break. As she was walking, she noticed that the park was unusually crowded. She wondered if there was a special event going on. But, as she got closer to the crowd, she realized that it was not a special event, but a group of tourists taking selfies with a robot.</p>
  <p>Marie was intrigued and decided to take a closer look. She saw that the robot was a new model developed by a well-known tech company. It was equipped with artificial intelligence, which allowed it to answer questions and interact with people. Marie also noticed that the robot was emitting a lot of heat, and it was using a lot of power.</p>
  <p>This got Marie thinking about the hidden costs of artificial intelligence on the environment. She did some research and found out that AI has several hidden climate costs that are often overlooked. Here are some examples:</p>
  <h2>Examples of AI's Hidden Climate Costs</h2>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>Energy Consumption:</strong> AI requires a lot of computing power, which translates into a lot of energy consumption. This energy consumption contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.</li>
   <li><strong>Data Centers:</strong> AI requires data centers to store, process and analyze large amounts of data. Data centers consume a lot of energy and require cooling systems, which contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
   <li><strong>Mining:</strong> The production of AI hardware requires the extraction of rare earth minerals, which are often mined in environmentally sensitive areas. This mining can cause habitat destruction, soil erosion, and pollution.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Marie realized that AI's hidden climate costs were not just theoretical, but they had real consequences. She decided to take action and make some changes in her own life.</p>
  <p>Here are some tips that Marie came up with:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Buy energy-efficient devices that consume less power.</li>
   <li>Use cloud computing and shared data centers to reduce energy consumption.</li>
   <li>Support companies that are committed to sustainable and ethical production.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In conclusion, AI's hidden climate costs are a real problem that needs to be addressed. We need to be aware of the environmental impact of AI and take action to reduce it. By making conscious choices and supporting sustainable practices, we can make a difference.</p>
  <h2>3 Key Takeaways</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>AI requires a lot of energy and contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
   <li>Data centers and mining are also significant contributors to AI's climate costs.</li>
   <li>We need to take action and make conscious choices to reduce AI's environmental impact.</li>
  </ul>
