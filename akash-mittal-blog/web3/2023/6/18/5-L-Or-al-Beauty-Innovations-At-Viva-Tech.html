    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>Julie has always struggled with finding the right foundation shade for her skin tone. No matter what brands she tried, she was never satisfied with the result. However, attending the Viva Tech showcase event organized by L'Oréal, she discovered their new AR (Augmented Reality) technology that allowed her to see how different shades would look on her skin before ever trying them on. She was amazed at the precision and ease of use, and finally found her perfect shade.</p>
