    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <ol>
     <li><strong>Mobile Payments:</strong> The rise of mobile payments has transformed the way people do business. Services like Apple Pay, Google Wallet, and Samsung Pay have made it easier for consumers to pay for goods and services using their mobile devices. Merchants have also embraced this technology, as it reduces the need for cash and credit cards, resulting in faster and more efficient transactions.</li>
     <li><strong>Virtual Reality:</strong> Virtual reality has opened up new avenues for e-commerce. Companies can create virtual stores where customers can shop online as if they were in a physical store. Moreover, virtual reality also enables companies to offer virtual product demonstrations, which can lead to increased sales.</li>
     <li><strong>Blockchain Technology:</strong> Blockchain technology has enabled the creation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which has disrupted traditional forms of currency. Cryptocurrencies allow for secure and anonymous transactions, making them a popular alternative for online transactions.</li>
