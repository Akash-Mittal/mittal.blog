   <p>It was a sunny Monday in New York when the first Bit Block Summit AI+WEB3.0 Summit of 2023 (BBS.NYC) took place. The event was co-hosted by DCOREUM, a leading blockchain and digital asset consulting firm. Dozens of experts, startup founders, and technology aficionados gathered at the New York Marriott Marquis to discuss the cutting edge of blockchain tech and more.</p>
   <p>The keynote speakers were Antonia Juricic, DCOREUM's CEO, and David Chaum, a computer scientist and bitcoin pioneer. Antonia kicked things off by talking about the state of the blockchain industry, trends, and challenges. She gave examples of successful blockchain applications in various industries, such as finance, supply chain, healthcare, energy, and art. For instance, she told the story of Artory, a company that is using blockchain tech to create a secure and transparent art registry. This registry ensures that art pieces are unique, verified, and traceable and thus unleashes new opportunities for market access, investment, and authentication.</p>
   <p>David, in turn, presented his latest research on privacy-enhanced cryptocurrencies. He explained how his new protocol, Praxxis, reduces the risk of surveillance and censorship by using quantum-resistant signatures and multi-party computation. He illustrated how this protocol could be applied to different use cases, such as secure messaging, voting, gaming, and smart contracts. He also referred to his earlier work on digital cash systems, such as eCash, which inspired the creation of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p>
   <p>The presentations were followed by a panel discussion on the intersection of AI and blockchain. The panelists were Priscilla Chiu, the CTO of SingularityNET, a decentralized AI platform, Adam Parness, the VP of Music Licensing at Twitch, a live streaming platform, and John Doe, a consultant at IBM Blockchain. They debated the potential synergies, challenges, and ethics of combining AI and blockchain. They gave examples of how AI could enhance blockchain scalability, privacy, and intelligence, and how blockchain could increase AI transparency, accountability, and fairness. They also discussed the risks of AI bias, fake data, and autonomous agents that could threaten privacy, security, and democracy.</p>
   <p>After the panel, the participants split into several workshops that addressed specific topics, such as token economics, regulatory compliance, decentralized finance, and digital identity. The workshops were facilitated by experts from DCOREUM, other consulting firms, and academic institutions. They provided hands-on advice, insights, and tools to help startups and enterprises leverage blockchain tech for their business models. Some participants shared their personal experiences and case studies, such as how they overcame regulatory obstacles, raised funds through ICOs, or pilot-tested blockchain applications in real-life scenarios.</p>
   <p>In the end, the BBS.NYC event was a great success. It brought together a diverse and passionate community of blockchain enthusiasts who shared their knowledge, expertise, and vision for the future of blockchain. It showcased the latest innovation, trends, and challenges of the blockchain industry and provided practical guidance and resources for entrepreneurs, investors, and policymakers.</p>
