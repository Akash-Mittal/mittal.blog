   <p>Once upon a time, a boy named Max was trying to solve a problem related to his science project. He searched the internet and found a website that promised to provide all the accurate information he needed to finish his project. But to his surprise, the website was misleading, and the information provided was baseless.</p>
   <p>This is just one example of how AI and its effects on today's world can be more than unsettling. With the rise of AI, we are not mentally ready for a ‘Post-Truth World'. In today's world, misleading information is everywhere, and people are more susceptible to believe false information without question. We need to understand why we are not ready for this AI-saturated world and how it will impact our society and personal life.</p>
   <p>AI technology is already shaping the world we know, from chatbots to autonomous cars. In the past few years, AI has evolved to the point where it is now possible to generate "deepfakes" - convincing videos that replace the actual parts of the content with something else. Fake videos are also a part of the AI world, used to mislead the masses and disrupt the society.</p>
   <p>As AI is becoming more commonly available, we need to understand the threat it poses to society. A study published in the Harvard Business Review states that the manipulation of public opinion, through the use of deepfakes, is rapidly becoming the preferred method of propaganda. Today, anyone with access to the internet can pick and choose data that supports their desired truth, and AI can make it seem very convincing, even when it is not true.</p>
   <p>AI's impact on personal life is also something that we need to consider. With AI being used for facial recognition and security, our private lives are being monitored without our knowledge. Our digital footprints are being traced, and our personal information is being collected and analyzed, without our permission, and for the benefit of corporations.</p>
   <p>Despite all these issues, the biggest challenge that we face today is the inability of humans to grasp the nuances of the ‘Post-Truth World'. Our brain is not wired to differentiate between truth and falsehoods, and we are more likely to believe a lie than a mundane truth. Even the most educated and rational individual can fall prey to this trap.</p>
   <p>Moreover, AI has advanced to the point where it can predict our behavior, and our actions, using data collected about us. This can pose a threat to our tendencies, knowing what we will do next, and hence impact our choices and decision-making abilities.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, AI has the power to enhance our lives to an unimaginable degree, but with this power comes responsibility. It is up to us to try and keep the use of AI in check, limit its capabilities, and only use it for projects and information that benefits everyone and not just the corporations. As the world becomes increasingly dependent on technology, it is important to keep in mind that we need to have healthy skepticism and seek out credible sources for information. Finally, we also need to be aware of the boundaries of AI and its limitations. It's high time we establish a code of ethics that is adapted to the constantly evolving AI world.</p>
