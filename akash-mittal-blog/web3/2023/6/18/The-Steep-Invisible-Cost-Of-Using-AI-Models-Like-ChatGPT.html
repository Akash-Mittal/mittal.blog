    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>It was a bright sunny day when Fran, a customer service representative, received an email from her supervisor asking her to try out a new AI model called ChatGPT. Fran was excited to try out the new technology that would make her job easier. She was impressed by the speed and accuracy of the AI model in responding to customer queries.</p>
    <p>However, a few weeks later, Fran noticed that the AI model was not as perfect as it seemed. The model struggled to understand customer queries that had a deeper meaning or were indirect. Fran realised that the AI model was not fully equipped to handle complex customer queries and it was making her job harder rather than easier.</p>
    <p>This incident was a wake-up call for Fran and many others like her who were excited about the promise of AI models like ChatGPT. While they seem like a quick and easy solution to many problems, the use of AI models comes with a steep and invisible cost that many organisations are not aware of.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>AI models like ChatGPT may seem like a great solution for customer service, but they have limitations. The models are trained on large datasets, which do not always include all the nuances of human interactions. As a result, the AI models may not be able to understand the context of a customer query and provide an appropriate response. This can result in frustrated customers, as well as additional work for the customer service representatives who have to fix the problem.</p>
    <p>Another example of the high cost of using AI models is in healthcare. AI models are often used to diagnose diseases by analysing medical images and patient data. While AI models can be accurate, they require a lot of training and fine-tuning. This means that the cost of training an AI model for healthcare can be high, and mistakes made by the model can lead to disastrous outcomes for patients.</p>
    <p>In addition to these examples, it is worth noting that AI models can also be biased. If the datasets used to train these models are biased, then the AI model will also display that same bias, resulting in unfair outcomes. This is particularly true in situations where AI models are used to make hiring decisions or determine who is eligible for certain services.</p>
    <p>To mitigate the risks associated with AI models, it is essential to invest in regular maintenance and updates. This not only ensures that the model remains accurate and unbiased, but it also ensures that it continues to meet the needs of the organisation and its customers.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, while AI models like ChatGPT and others may seem like a quick and easy solution to problems, they come with a steep and often invisible cost. This cost includes the need for regular maintenance and updates, as well as the risk of biased outcomes and inaccurate responses. It is essential to invest in ongoing training and regular evaluation to ensure that AI models remain relevant and accurate.</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Invest in regular maintenance and updates of AI models to ensure they remain accurate and unbiased.</li>
     <li>Acknowledge the limitations of AI models and invest in regular training and fine-tuning to address the gaps in the datasets.</li>
     <li>Ensure that AI models do not replace human decision-making and that they are used in conjunction with human expertise and judgement.</li>
    </ol>
