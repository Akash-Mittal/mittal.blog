    <h2>A Story of Binance Humiliation</h2>
    <p>In May 2019, Binance - the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange - suffered a major security breach, in which hackers stole 7,000 bitcoin worth around $40 million. The breach was a major embarrassment for Binance, as its founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao had boasted about the company's security measures in the past.</p>
    <p>The incident highlighted the ongoing challenges that cryptocurrency exchanges face in protecting their users' digital assets from cyber attacks. It also underscored the need for skilled workers who can help prevent such attacks.</p>

    <h2>Hong Kong Needs 100K Crypto Workers</h2>
    <p>Hong Kong's blockchain and cryptocurrency industry is growing rapidly, and the city's government is keen to position it as a global hub for these emerging technologies. However, the sector is facing a skills shortage, with a shortfall of around 10,000 workers.</p>
    <p>To address this issue, the Hong Kong government has set a goal of training 100,000 people in blockchain and crypto-related skills over the next five years. This is in line with similar initiatives in other countries, such as the United States and China, where governments are investing heavily in the development of these technologies.</p>
    <p>Some of the skills that are in demand in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry include programming, cryptography, cybersecurity, and financial analysis. Many of these are areas that require specialized training and expertise, making it difficult to find qualified workers.</p>

    <h2>China's AI Unicorn</h2>
    <p>Sensetime, a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) startup, recently became the world's most valuable AI unicorn, after raising $600 million in a funding round led by Alibaba Group Holding and Singaporean investment firm Temasek Holdings.</p>
    <p>The company is now valued at $4.5 billion, and has been hailed as a pioneer in the field of AI, particularly in the areas of facial recognition and object detection. However, it has also faced criticism from human rights groups, who argue that its technologies are being used to monitor and control citizens in China.</p>
    <p>Despite these challenges, Sensetime's success underscores the growing importance of AI in China's economy and its global competitiveness. The government has made AI a priority area for investment and development, and is seeking to establish China as a world leader in the field.</p>
