  <p>John was an avid gamer. He spent countless hours in front of his computer screen, playing games that he had spent his hard-earned money on. One day, a friend introduced him to web3 gaming. At first, John was skeptical. He had heard about the wild speculation that surrounded this new form of gaming. However, when he tried a web3 game for the first time, he was surprised. It was unlike anything he had ever experienced before.</p>
  <p>Web3 gaming has been around for a few years now, but it has only recently entered a new era. In the past, web3 gaming was viewed as a speculative investment. People were interested in the technology behind it and the potential for making money, rather than the actual games themselves. However, this is no longer the case. Web3 gaming has started to shift towards quality over speculation.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Quality In Web3 Gaming</h2>
  <p>One major example of this shift is the recent release of Axie Infinity. Axie Infinity is a game that is built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows players to battle creatures called Axies in a turn-based strategy game. The game has become incredibly popular, with players spending tens of thousands of dollars on Axies and items in the game. However, the reason for its success is not just because of the potential for making money. The game itself is fun, engaging, and well-designed. It has a loyal fanbase that loves playing the game for the sake of playing it.</p>
  <p>Another example of quality over speculation in web3 gaming is the rise of metaverse games. Metaverse games are virtual worlds where players can interact with each other and the environment. These games have become popular because they provide an immersive experience that is not possible with traditional video games. For example, The Sandbox is a metaverse game that allows players to create their own virtual worlds and sell them as NFTs. The game has attracted a large following because of the creativity and social aspect it provides, not just because of the potential to make money off NFT sales.</p>
  <h2>Why Quality Over Speculation is Important</h2>
  <p>The shift towards quality over speculation in web3 gaming is important for a few reasons. First, it ensures that gamers have access to high-quality games that are fun to play. In the past, web3 gaming was seen as a niche market that only appealed to those who were interested in the technology or making money. However, with the shift towards quality, web3 gaming has become more inclusive and accessible to a wider audience.</p>
  <p>Second, it helps to establish web3 gaming as a legitimate industry. The speculative nature of web3 gaming in the past made it difficult for it to be taken seriously. However, with the shift towards quality, web3 gaming has the potential to be seen as a viable industry that can compete with traditional video games.</p>
  <p>Finally, the shift towards quality over speculation is important because it helps to build trust in the web3 gaming ecosystem. The past speculation and scams associated with web3 gaming have made many people wary of investing time and money in this industry. However, by focusing on quality, web3 gaming can start to build a reputation for itself as a trustworthy and reliable industry.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The shift towards quality over speculation in web3 gaming is an important development. It helps to ensure that gamers have access to high-quality games that are fun to play, establishes web3 gaming as a legitimate industry, and builds trust in the web3 gaming ecosystem. By focusing on quality, web3 gaming has the potential to become a major player in the video game industry.</p>
