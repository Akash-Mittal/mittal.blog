   <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <p>Many people believe that we are witnessing another dotcom bubble, but this time in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). The concerns are understandable, given the hype and investment surrounding the technology. However, AI is not a repetition of the dotcom era, and in this article, we will explore why that is.</p>
   <p>We will share some quantifiable examples of how AI is transforming industries and tackle the reasons why AI is different from the dotcom boom. Additionally, we will touch on some exciting case studies that illustrate our points. Finally, we will provide some practical tips for businesses so that they can best prepare for the AI revolution.</p>
   <h2>The Dotcom Era</h2>
   <blockquote>
    "In the late 1990s, the dotcom era brought unprecedented excitement to the tech industry. It gave birth to many innovative and disruptive businesses that would go on to shape the digital landscape as we know it today. However, the dotcom era was also plagued by perilous investments that eventually led to the bursting of the bubble."
   </blockquote>
   <p>Investors were so enthusiastic about dotcom businesses, they were willing to back the ideas of anyone who could put together a website. Millions of dollars chased businesses whose revenues were paltry, at best. When investors began to realise that these businesses could not deliver the revenue growth to justify their valuations, the bubble burst.</p>
   <h2>Why AI is Different</h2>
   <blockquote>
    "AI, in contrast to the dotcom era, is not a bubble about to burst. Instead, it is a transformational technology that is accelerating the progress we make in industries ranging from healthcare to retail. There are various reasons why AI is not a dotcom redux."
   </blockquote>
   <h3>Mature Market</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>While it is true that there is considerable hype around AI, it is not as prevalent as the buzz around dotcoms during their heyday. There is now a more mature attitude to investment with more discerning investors in the market.</li>
    <li>The number of AI startups that have received multiple rounds of funding has been on the rise, indicating that investors are seeing the potential of the technology, and the momentum is building.</li>
   </ol>
   <h3>Tangible Benefits</h3>
   <p>AI has already contributed to significant progress in various sectors.</p>
   <ol>
    <li>AI-powered natural language processing (NLP) is now used in customer support to respond to commonly asked questions, reducing the need for human support. This helps cut costs while improving customer experiences.</li>
    <li>AI is transforming the medical industry. Scientists have developed deep neural networks to detect cancer cells on MRI scans, reducing the need for invasive procedures. AI-improved diagnostic technology will save lives and significantly lower healthcare costs.</li>
    <li>AI is also helping businesses cut waste. Retailers can use predictive analytics to predict demand for products, allowing them to order more efficiently and minimise waste.</li>
   </ol>
   <h3>More Predictable</h3>
   <p>Unlike the dotcom era, where many people invested vast amounts of money in the hope of becoming millionaires overnight, AI investment is more measured.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Most AI startups are focused on solving concrete problems, rather than on securing a large user base. Investors prefer startups that have a clear path to profitability.</li>
    <li>Venture capitalists are more interested in themes such as "AI for enterprise" than startups that are attempting to disrupt entire industries without a viable business model.</li>
   </ul>
   
   <p>Here are some quantifiable examples of how AI is transforming various industries:</p>
   <h3>Healthcare</h3>
   <p>AI has already had a significant impact on the healthcare industry. Machine learning is being used to develop early warning systems for sepsis, a critical condition that is difficult to diagnose.</p><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=AI+for+healthcare" alt="AI for healthcare">
   <p>AI is also being used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease and is capable of identifying it six years before clinical diagnosis.</p>
   <h3>Finance</h3>
   <p>The financial sector stands to benefit immensely from the application of AI. AI is used to analyse vast amounts of data, help detect fraudulent transactions, and provide predictive analytics for investment management.</p><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=AI+for+finance" alt="AI for finance">
   <p>Some banks are using AI-powered chatbots to assist customers, saving significant costs on customer service staffing while improving customer experiences.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <h3>Oura Health</h3>
   <blockquote>
    "Oura Health is a Finnish startup that manufactures activity and sleep trackers. Their latest product, the Oura Ring, tracks sleep quality, heart rate variability, and body temperature. However, the Oura Ring goes beyond basic fitness and sleep tracking; it also helps detect early COVID-19 symptoms."
   </blockquote>
   <p>The Oura Ring uses AI algorithms to monitor the user's body temperature and heart rate variability. Using this data, the ring can provide early signs of COVID-19 infections before they show physical symptoms, allowing for early intervention.</p>
   <h3>Google DeepMind</h3>
   <blockquote>
    "Google DeepMind is a UK-based research company that specialises in AI development. Founded in 2010, Google acquired the company in 2015 for $500 million."
   </blockquote>
   <p>DeepMind is being used to improve healthcare diagnostics and treatment. For example, Google DeepMind has partnered with Moorfields Eye Hospital in London to use deep learning to identify abnormalities in retinal scans.</p>
   <h2>Practical Tips for Businesses</h2>
   <p>As AI continues to gain traction and become more mainstream, here are some tips businesses should keep in mind:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Invest in AI talent: Hire individuals with experience in AI and machine learning to help identify opportunities to improve operations and customer experience.</li>
    <li>Focus on tangible benefits: Look for practical ways in which AI can help solve problems and/or improve performance. Instead of focusing on flashy applications of AI, look for ways to improve existing processes and reduce costs.</li>
    <li>Consider partnering with AI firms: Consider partnering with AI companies to develop and implement AI solutions. AI startups have a wealth of knowledge and expertise that could be leveraged to complement existing businesses.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2 id="conclusion">3 Key Takeaways</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>AI is not a dotcom redux. It is a transformational technology that is ushering in a new era of progress in various industries.</li>
    <li>AI investment is more measured than dotcom investments. Startups are more focused on providing tangible solutions that solve concrete problems.</li>
    <li>Practical tips for businesses include investing in AI talent, focusing on tangible benefits, and considering partnering with AI firms.</li>
