  <p>Artificial intelligence has been around for decades, but it has only recently started to make a significant impact on society. Today, AI is everywhere, from Siri and Alexa on our phones, to the Google algorithms that control the search results we see. The potential for AI in the future is limitless, and investors are starting to take notice. In this article, we will explore some of the top AI companies to buy stock in and some of the smaller AI businesses that show promise.</p>
  <h2>The Story of X.AI</h2>
  <p>It's been a long day, and you are trying to wind down for the evening. The last thing on your to-do list is scheduling a meeting with a potential client. You don't have the energy to send yet another email back and forth to find a time that works for both parties. This is where x.ai comes in to save the day.</p>
  <p>X.ai is a New York based start-up that has created an AI assistant that schedules meetings for you. The assistant's name is Amy, and she is entirely powered by deep learning algorithms. All you have to do is cc Amy on an email to the person you want to meet with, and she takes care of the rest. Amy suggests times that work for both of you, adds the meeting to your calendar, and even sends out follow-up emails to confirm the meeting.</p>
  <p>The idea for x.ai came from the company's CEO, Dennis Mortensen, who was tired of scheduling meetings himself. Mortensen estimates that he spent approximately 1,000 hours a year on scheduling. X.ai has raised over $44 million in funding so far, and some of its investors include Softbank and prominent angels like Ed Sim.</p>
