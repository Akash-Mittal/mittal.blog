  <p class="article">If there's one movie that has remained a Halloween classic over the years, it's "Hocus Pocus." The 1993 movie, starring Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy as a trio of witches, has been a fan favorite for decades, and now, 28 years later, a third installment is finally in the works.</p>
  <p class="article">News of "Hocus Pocus 3" has been circulating for a while now and fans are eagerly waiting for any news regarding the release. Taking to their Twitter handle, the makers of the movie, Disney, confirmed last year that "Hocus Pocus 3" was indeed in development, with Jen D'Angelo ("Workaholics," "Happy Together") serving as writer and co-producer.</p>
  <p class="article">But what other details do we know about the upcoming movie? Here are some last updates on "Hocus Pocus 3" that we've managed to dig up:</p>
  <ul class="article">
   <li>The Original Cast May Return: While there's been no official confirmation regarding the cast, rumors have been circulating that the original cast may return to reprise their roles. Talking to HollywoodLife, Sarah Jessica Parker expressed her interest in returning to the franchise, saying, "We've all been talking about it. I think we've been really, really focused on getting this right because we love it just as much as you do."</li>
   <li>It's Not a Remake: Despite being the third installment, "Hocus Pocus 3" will not be a remake of the first two movies. Instead, it will be a continuation of the story, which will likely pick up from where "Hocus Pocus 2: The Witch is Back" left off.</li>
   <li>The Release is Still Uncertain: While Disney has confirmed that "Hocus Pocus 3" is in development, there's been no news regarding the release date. This could be because of the ongoing pandemic, which has disrupted the media industry, resulting in many delays and pushed back releases.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="article">Of course, these updates are just a few of the many rumors and speculations surrounding the upcoming "Hocus Pocus 3." But with the original cast potentially returning, and a continuation of the story in the works, it's safe to say that fans are in for a real treat.</p>
