    <h2>The Formation of a Creative Mind</h2>
    <p>Liu Cixin was born in 1963 in Yangquan, Shanxi Province, China. Growing up during the Cultural Revolution, he was exposed to both the hardships and the redemptive power of literature, stories, and the human imagination.</p>
    <p>As a student of geological engineering at the Henan University of Science and Technology in Luoyang, Liu read widely and voraciously, consuming every science fiction book he could get his hands on.</p>
    <p>It was during this time that he began to experiment with writing his own science fiction stories, and after winning an award for one of his stories, he decided to pursue writing seriously.</p>

    <h2>The Breakthrough</h2>
    <p>Liu Cixin struggled for many years to break through as a writer. His rejection letters numbered in the hundreds, and he spent many long nights wondering if he would ever be able to make a living from his writing.</p>
    <p>But he persisted, and in 1999 he won the prestigious "China Galaxy Science Fiction Award" for his story "The Village Teacher". This award was a turning point for Liu, and he began to gain recognition and critical acclaim for his work.</p>
    <p>However, it was his trilogy of books known as "The Three Body Problem" that truly catapulted him to fame. The first book in the trilogy was published in 2008, and it quickly became a sensation in China, winning the Hugo Award</p>
