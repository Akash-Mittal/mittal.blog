    <p>Imagine walking into a job interview and being greeted not by a person, but by a robot. The robot asks you questions, analyzes your body language, and determines whether or not you are a suitable candidate for the job. This scenario may seem far-fetched, but it could become a reality in the near future thanks to artificial intelligence (AI).</p>

    <h2>What is AI?</h2>
    <p>AI refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making. There are different types of AI, including rule-based systems, machine learning, and deep learning.</p>

   <section id="power-of-ai">
    <h2>The Power of AI</h2>
    <p>AI has the potential to revolutionize industries such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. For example, AI-powered medical diagnosis systems can analyze large amounts of medical data and assist doctors in making accurate diagnoses, while self-driving cars can reduce accidents and traffic congestion.</p>
    <p>AI can also help businesses streamline their operations and improve customer experiences. Chatbots, for example, can provide customers with instant support and personalized recommendations.</p>
    <p>Quantifiable examples of the power of AI include Google's AlphaGo, which defeated a world champion at the game of Go, and DeepMind's AlphaFold, which solved one of biology's grand challenges by predicting protein structures with high accuracy.</p>

   <section id="threat-of-ai">
    <h2>The Threat of AI</h2>
    <p>While AI has many potential benefits, it also poses significant risks. One of the main concerns is the impact of AI on employment, as it could lead to job displacement and income inequality.</p>
    <p>Another concern is the potential misuse of AI, such as the development of autonomous weapons that could make decisions without human intervention. Additionally, AI could be used to manipulate public opinion or invade people's privacy.</p>
    <p>Quantifiable examples of the threat of AI include the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement agencies, which can lead to false arrests or discrimination, and the use of AI-powered deepfakes, which can create highly realistic fake videos that can be used to spread misinformation.</p>

   <section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, AI has the power to transform our lives in many positive ways, but it also poses significant risks that should not be ignored. To harness the power of AI while mitigating its risks, it is important to have ethical guidelines and regulations in place.</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Invest in AI research and development to maximize its benefits</li>
     <li>Establish ethical guidelines and regulations to minimize its risks</li>
     <li>Encourage public education and awareness to foster responsible use of AI</li>
    </ol>
