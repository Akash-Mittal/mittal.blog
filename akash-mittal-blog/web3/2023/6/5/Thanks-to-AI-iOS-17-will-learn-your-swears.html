  <p>Technology has come a long way, and it's changing the way we interact with our devices. With the rise of AI, our devices have become smarter, and they can now understand our speech with more accuracy. But what if your device could also learn your swears?</p>
  <h2>An interesting story</h2>
  <p>Imagine this scenario: you're stuck in traffic, and you're late for an important meeting. As you're driving, you see that the road is completely blocked off. You scream out a swear word in frustration, and your iPhone hears you. Instead of reprimanding you for using foul language, your iPhone understands your frustration and offers to reroute you to another location.</p>
  <p>This is the future of AI, and iOS 17 is set to be the first device that will learn your swears. The developers at Apple have been working on a new AI system that can understand and interpret swear words in everyday language.</p>
  <h2>Quantifiable examples</h2>
  <p>To ensure that the AI system is accurate, the developers at Apple have collected a database of over 10,000 swear words and phrases. This database has been analyzed and categorized, allowing the AI system to understand the context in which a swear word is being used.</p>
  <p>For example, if you're playing a game on your iPhone, and you lose a level, the AI system will recognize your frustration and may offer you a hint or a walkthrough to help you complete the level. Similarly, if you're using Siri to set a reminder for an important task, and you accidentally use a swear word, the AI system will recognize your intention and will still set the reminder for you.</p>
