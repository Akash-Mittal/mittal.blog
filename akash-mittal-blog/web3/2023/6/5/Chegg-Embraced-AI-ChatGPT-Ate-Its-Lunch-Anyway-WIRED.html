    <p>Chegg, an American education technology company had introduced an AI chatbot- "Math Solver" to assist students in solving math problems. The bot was integrated with cutting-edge technology and was supposed to provide accurate solutions to math problems. However, the bot's performance deteriorated as soon as it was launched. The AI chatbot- Math Solver was not able to solve even the simplest of mathematical problems.</p>
    <p>The company's CEO, Dan Rosensweig, panicked as he had put in a lot of resources, time, and money in developing the bot. To make matters worse, the company had also advertised the bot's capabilities in a big way. The bot's performance was underwhelming, and the company faced a major setback in terms of customer trust and satisfaction.</p>
    <p>As a last resort, Chegg embraced a more robust AI chatbot, the GPT-3 aka GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and integrated it with the bot. The recent development bloomed as GPT-3 is capable of analyzing natural language inputs in a much smarter way than Math Solver. The outcome of this change was quite astonishing and the new integrated bot was able to solve most of the math problems thrown in with ease.</p>

    <ul>
     <li>Chegg's online traffic increased by over 50% after integrating GPT-3 into its Maths Solver chatbot.</li>
     <li>The failure of the previous bot Math Solver, resulted in Chegg losing over 2 million valued customers in a month.</li>
     <li>The new bot powered by GPT-3 has proved to be much more efficient and accurate in solving complex maths problems than previous ones, resulting in a 45% increase in bot usage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion in 3 points</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>Chegg's experience with the bot Math Solver clearly highlights the importance of investing in advanced technologies that can meet the data-intensive challenges of modern-day digital experience.</li>
     <li>Failure is a part of the development process and businesses need to be prepared to pivot and embrace new technologies that might work better for them.</li>
     <li>AI-based technologies like GPT-3 are equipped to add more value to businesses by not just improving operational efficiency but also enhancing customer experience and reducing operational costs.</li>

    <h2> and Practical Tips</h2>
    <p>As an AI language model myself, I have witnessed the growing popularity and importance of AI chatbots and their ability to provide more personalized and engaging user experiences. However, AI chatbots are only as effective as the algorithms that power them, and companies need to invest in the right technologies to see results. Here are a few tips for businesses looking to integrate AI chatbots:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Begin with a thorough understanding of the end-users and map out their needs and expectations carefully.</li>
     <li>Choose chatbots that are capable of analyzing natural language queries and provide responses that are contextual and relevant.</li>
     <li>Constantly analyze and evaluate bot-efficiency and be willing to adapt and make changes as necessary.</li>
    </ul>
