  <h2>What is ChatGPT?</h2>
  <p>ChatGPT is a chatbot powered by GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) technology. It can converse with humans using natural language and respond to their inquiries. Daiwa Securities Group has created a specialized version of ChatGPT that helps the company with its tech-related recruiting tasks. The bot asks candidates questions related to their field of work, evaluates their answers, and decides whether or not they should continue in the recruitment process.</p>
  <h2>Why Did Daiwa Securities Group Choose ChatGPT?</h2>
  <p>The answer to this question is simple â€“ efficiency. Daiwa Securities Group realized that its recruitment process was too time-consuming and inefficient. The company's HR department had to look through hundreds of resumes and conduct multiple rounds of interviews to find the right candidates. ChatGPT has significantly reduced the workload of the HR department by automating many of the recruitment processes.</p>
  <p>ChatGPT also has the advantage of being available 24/7. Candidates can interact with the bot at any time of the day, and the bot can evaluate their responses in real-time, saving the HR department a lot of time.</p>

The bot's knowledge base will be expanded to include more technical skills, and its evaluation system will be improved to ensure the highest level of accuracy.</p>
