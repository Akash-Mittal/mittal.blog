     <h3>The Painting That Started it All</h3>
     <p>In 2018, an art collector bought a portrait for $432,500 at a Christies auction. The portrait, titled "Portrait of Edmond de Belamy," was created by a Paris-based art collective called "Obvious." But what made it unique was that it was generated by an AI algorithm using a technique called Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).</p>

     <h3>The Rise of AI Creativity</h3>
     <p>Since the creation of "Portrait of Edmond de Belamy," AI creativity has been gaining momentum and is now a thriving area of research. Many tech giants such as Google, IBM, and Microsoft have invested heavily in developing AI algorithms that can perform creative tasks such as composing music, writing poetry, and even creating videos.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3> AI Creativity</h3>
     <p>Some quantifiable examples of AI Creativity include:</p>
     <ul>
      <li><strong>GAN-Generated Paintings</strong>: The "Portrait of Edmond de Belamy" is just one of many AI-generated paintings that have been sold at auctions for large sums of money.</li>
      <li><strong>AI-Composed Music</strong>: AI algorithms such as Amper Music's AI composer can create music based on different moods, genres, and instruments.</li>
      <li><strong>AI-Written Poetry</strong>: Google's AI system, PoemPortraits, generates poems based on a user's selfie.</li>
     </ul>
    </section>

     <h3>The Limitations of AI Creativity</h3>
     <p>While there have been many breakthroughs in AI creativity, there are certain limitations that AI algorithms face when it comes to creative tasks. Some of these limitations include:</p>
     <ul>
      <li><strong>Lack of Contextual Understanding</strong>: AI algorithms lack the contextual understanding of the world that humans possess, which can limit their creativity.</li>
      <li><strong>Lack of Empathy</strong>: AI algorithms do not possess empathy, which can limit their ability to create emotionally-charged art.</li>
      <li><strong>Difficulty in Breaking Rules</strong>: AI algorithms generally excel at following established rules, but can find it difficult to break them, which is an important aspect of creative expression.</li>
     </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>How Can AI Creativity Be Improved?</h3>
     <p>Despite the limitations, researchers are constantly working on improving AI creativity. Some of the ways in which AI creativity can be improved include:</p>
     <ul>
      <li><strong>Training AI Algorithms on More Data</strong>: The more data AI algorithms are exposed to, the better they can learn and understand the patterns of creative expression.</li>
      <li><strong>Developing AI Algorithms that Can Learn Rules and Break Them</strong>: By developing AI algorithms that can learn to break established rules, they can become more expressive and innovative.</li>
      <li><strong>Combining AI Algorithms with Human Creativity</strong>: By combining the strengths of AI algorithms and human creativity, we can create more impactful and emotionally-charged art.</li>
     </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h3>Conclusion</h3>
     <p>In conclusion, while AI creativity has come a long way since the creation of the "Portrait of Edmond de Belamy," there is still a long way to go. We have seen examples of AI-generated art, music, and poetry, but there are still limitations that need to be overcome.</p>
     <ol>
      <li>AI algorithms lack the contextual understanding and empathy that humans possess, which can limit their creativity.</li>
      <li>AI algorithms can find it difficult to break established rules, which is an important aspect of creative expression.</li>
      <li>However, researchers are constantly working on improving AI creativity by training algorithms on more data, developing algorithms that can learn to break rules, and combining AI with human creativity.</li>
