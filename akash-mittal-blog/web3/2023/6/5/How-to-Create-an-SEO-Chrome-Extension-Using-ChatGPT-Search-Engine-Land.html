    <h3>The Power of SEO</h3>
    <p>Once upon a time, a small business owner named Sarah opened up her bakery in a charming little town. She had delicious treats, a warm smile, and a cozy atmosphere. She was certain that customers would come flocking to her door.</p>
    <p>But as the weeks went by, Sarah realized that she wasn't getting the online traffic she expected. Her website wasn't showing up on the first page of Google search results, and she wasn't getting as many online orders as she wanted. She became discouraged, worried that her dream of owning a successful bakery wasn't going to come true.</p>
    <p>That's where SEO comes in. By optimizing her website for search engines, Sarah was able to improve her search rankings and attract more traffic to her site. She learned how to use keywords, meta descriptions, and alt text to make her website more discoverable. As a result, her online orders increased, and her bakery became a success.</p>
