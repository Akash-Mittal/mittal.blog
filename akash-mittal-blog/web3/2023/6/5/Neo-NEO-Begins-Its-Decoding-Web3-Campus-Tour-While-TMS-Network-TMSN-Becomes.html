    <p>Once upon a time, in a world before Web3, universities were not interested in the blockchain industry. They often dismissed it as a niche market with no practical applications. However, things have changed with the introduction of Web3, and universities are now keen to engage with the blockchain ecosystem.</p>
    <p>This shift in attitude has not gone unnoticed by blockchain companies like Neo NEO and TMS Network (TMSN). The companies have seen an opportunity to engage with students and educate them on the practical applications of blockchain technology.</p>
    <p>To this end, Neo NEO has embarked on a decoding Web3 campus tour. Their aim is to educate students on the benefits and practical applications of blockchain technology in various sectors. The tour will also showcase the different use cases of the Neo blockchain platform.</p>
    <p>One of the quantifiable examples of the benefits of blockchain technology is the elimination of intermediaries. This feature reduces costs and increases efficiency. For example, in the finance industry, intermediaries like banks increase the cost of transactions. However, with blockchain technology, transactions can be completed directly between parties, without the need for intermediaries. This reduces transaction costs and increases the speed of transactions.</p>
    <p>Another quantifiable example is the increased security that comes with blockchain technology. The blockchain is a decentralized network, which makes it difficult for hackers to access and manipulate data. This feature is particularly useful in sectors such as healthcare, where data security is of utmost importance.</p>
    <p>To further engage students, TMS Network (TMSN) has also become involved in the blockchain education movement. TMSN is a blockchain-based platform that connects students, educators, and employers. The platform aims to provide practical experience to students learning about blockchain technology.</p>
    <p>TMSN has partnered with universities to provide blockchain courses and hands-on experience to students. The platform also provides a marketplace where students can sell their skills to employers in the blockchain industry. This model is a win-win for all parties involved, as it provides students with practical experience and employers with the talent they need.</p>
    <p>Some personal anecdotes can help illustrate the importance of blockchain education. For example, a student may have lost money due to an intermediary charging high transaction fees. However, through blockchain education, the student would have learned that blockchain technology can reduce these costs. Another example is a student who may have witnessed a healthcare data breach. Through blockchain education, the student would have learned about the increased security benefits of blockchain technology.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, the introduction of Web3 has led to a shift in attitude towards blockchain technology in universities. Blockchain companies, such as Neo NEO and TMS Network (TMSN), have recognized this opportunity to engage with students and educate them on the practical applications of blockchain technology. The benefits of this education are quantifiable, such as reduced costs and increased security, and personal anecdotes can illustrate the importance of blockchain education. As the blockchain industry continues to grow, it is essential that students are equipped with the skills they need to succeed in the industry.</p>
