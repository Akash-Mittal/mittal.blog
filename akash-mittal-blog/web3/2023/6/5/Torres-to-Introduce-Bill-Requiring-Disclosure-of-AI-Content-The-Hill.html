   <title>Torres to Introduce Bill Requiring Disclosure of AI Content | The Hill</title>
   <h1>Why Torres' Bill Requiring Disclosure of AI Content Is a Game Changer</h1> <img src="images/Torres-to-Introduce-Bill-Requiring-Disclosure-of-AI-Content-The-Hill.jpeg" alt="+Torres-to-Introduce-Bill-Requiring-Disclosure-of-AI-Content-The-Hill+">
   <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI), also known as machine learning, is becoming ubiquitous in our everyday lives. From social media algorithms to self-driving cars, AI is constantly making decisions that impact us. However, not all AI is created equal. Some algorithms may be biased or discriminatory, while others may be opaque, making it impossible for consumers to understand how they work. That's why Rep. Norma Torres (D-Calif.) is proposing a bill that would require companies to disclose when they're using AI and what data they're using to power their algorithms.</p>
   <h2>An Opaque World</h2>
   <p>Consider the example of facial recognition technology. According to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/technology/facial-recognition-race-artificial-intelligence.html" target="_blank">2018 study by the MIT Media Lab</a>, three commercial facial recognition systems were more than 95% accurate in identifying white men's faces, but less than 85% accurate in identifying the faces of darker-skinned women. This is due in part to the fact that the data sets the algorithms were trained on were overwhelmingly male and white. If companies had to disclose that they were using AI for facial recognition, consumers could ask questions about how the technology was developed and tested, and what safeguards are in place to prevent discrimination.</p>
   <h2>Disclosure Is Key</h2>
   <p>Torres' bill is a necessary step in ensuring that consumers are protected from bias and discrimination in AI. Without transparency, companies can develop algorithms that perpetuate existing inequalities and discriminate against certain groups. However, disclosure alone is not enough. It's also important to ensure that the data sets used to train AI are representative of the population as a whole. For example, if an algorithm is being used to predict which job applicants are the best fit, the data set should include a diverse range of candidates.</p>
   <h2>The Benefits of Ethical AI</h2>
   <p>While there are certainly risks involved in the use of AI, there are also clear benefits to using AI ethically. For example, AI can help diagnose diseases earlier and more accurately. It can also aid in disaster response by quickly identifying areas of need. However, in order to realize these benefits, we must ensure that AI is developed and deployed ethically. This includes not only disclosing when it is being used, but also ensuring that it is transparent, fair, and accountable.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion: Why Torres' Bill Matters</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Rep. Norma Torres' bill is a necessary step in protecting consumers from bias and discrimination in AI.</li>
    <li>Disclosure of AI use is key, but must be accompanied by efforts to ensure that data sets used to train AI are representative of the population as a whole.</li>
    <li>The benefits of ethical AI are clear, but we must take steps to ensure that it is developed and deployed in a transparent, fair, and accountable manner.</li>
