   <h2>The Story of John and Jane</h2>
   <p>John and Jane were two individuals who lived in a world where privacy and security were of utmost importance. After the rise of Web3, they started to use decentralized applications to manage their finances and personal information. However, they soon realized that these apps were not as secure as they thought.</p>
   <p>One day, John received an email from a hacker who claimed to have access to his decentralized wallet and demanded a ransom in exchange for the private key. John panicked, as he had invested a substantial amount of money in the wallet. He tried to contact the support team of the Web3 app, but the response was slow and unsatisfactory. In the end, he had to pay the ransom and lost a significant portion of his savings.</p>
   <p>Jane, on the other hand, was a victim of a phishing attack. She received an email that appeared to be from her Web3 app, asking her to log in to her account. She followed the link and entered her credentials, only to realize later that it was a fake website created by the hacker. The hacker gained access to her personal information and used it for fraudulent activities. Jane lost her identity and had to spend months to recover from the financial and emotional damage.</p>
   <h2>The Reality of Web3 Apps</h2>
   <p>The stories of John and Jane are not uncommon. Web3 apps have gained a reputation for being vulnerable to security breaches, hacks, and phishing attacks. These apps operate on a decentralized network, which makes them transparent, accessible, and permissionless. However, this also makes them prone to exploits, bugs, and flaws that can compromise the security and privacy of users' data.</p>
   <p>Web3 apps use blockchain technology, which is known for its immutability and transparency. However, this also means that once the data is on the blockchain, it cannot be changed or deleted. This poses a challenge for users who want to remove or modify their data, as well as for developers who want to fix bugs or upgrade the app.</p>
   <p>Web3 apps also face regulatory challenges. As they operate on a decentralized network, it is difficult to determine who is responsible for compliance with the laws and regulations. This can result in legal issues, lawsuits, and fines for both the developers and the users of the app.</p>
   <h2>The Examples of Web3 Apps Under Scrutiny</h2>
   <p>There have been several instances where Web3 apps have faced security breaches, hacks, and phishing attacks. Some of the notable examples are:</p>
