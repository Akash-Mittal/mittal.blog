  <p>The music industry has been struggling with capitalism and royalties for a long time. It's a classic story of the music artist vs the big record labels. With the introduction of web3 technologies, we are seeing a revolution in the way music is produced, distributed, and consumed. A new patent focusing on web3 music capital distribution is set to change the game even further.</p><img src="music.jpg" alt="Music">
  <h2>What is Web3 Music Capital Distribution?</h2>
  <p>Web3 is a term coined for describing the third generation of the internet that is based on decentralization and blockchain technology. For the music industry, this means more transparency, fair compensation, and direct communication between the artist and the consumer.</p>
  <p>Web3 music capital distribution is a system that uses smart contracts to automate the process of distributing royalties and other earnings to all stakeholders in the music industry, including artists, songwriters, producers, and investors. The smart contracts are self-executing agreements that are executed automatically when certain conditions are met.</p>
  
  <p>The introduction of web3 music capital distribution has already shown promising results in terms of fair compensation and transparency. Here are some quantifiable examples:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The song "Forever Mine" by R&amp;B singer Andra Day was released with a non-fungible token (NFT) attached to it, allowing fans to purchase a unique piece of memorabilia while giving Day a larger share of profits than she would have received under a traditional record deal.</li>
   <li>The decentralized music platform Audius has paid out over $10 million in royalties to independent artists since launching in 2019, with 90% of those earnings going directly to the artists themselves.</li>
   <li>The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has partnered with blockchain startup ConsenSys to create an in-house record label that will use blockchain technology to offer more transparent and efficient royalty payments to artists.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>The Patent</h2>
  <p>The new patent, filed by entrepreneur Napston on May 12, 2021, describes a system that allows for a seamless distribution of music capital through the use of web3 technologies. The patent details a process for using smart contracts to manage the distribution of earnings from streaming, downloads, merchandise sales, and other revenue streams directly to the artists.</p>
  <p>The patent could be a game-changer for independent artists who aren't signed to major record labels and who often struggle to gain fair compensation for their work. With the Napston system, artists would be able to receive royalties directly and in real-time, without the need for intermediaries such as record labels or streaming platforms.</p>
