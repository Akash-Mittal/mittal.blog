  <p>Have you ever come across an LLM (Language Learning Model) that imitates ChatGPT TechTalks? It may seem like a good idea to use a popular platform to learn a new language, but there are certain risks associated with it. Let me tell you a story that illustrates this point.</p>
  <h2>A story of misunderstanding</h2>
  <p>One day, John, an English speaker, decided to learn Chinese with an LLM that imitates ChatGPT TechTalks. He found a conversation on the platform where two Chinese native speakers were discussing the weather. He thought it would be a good idea to practice his Chinese by joining the conversation.</p>
  <p>He typed in the chat, "你们觉得今天天气怎么样？" (What do you think about the weather today?), but to his surprise, the two native speakers didn't respond. John thought his Chinese was not good enough, so he tried again, but still no response. He felt discouraged and confused.</p>
  <p>What John didn't realize was that the LLM had a delay in response time and the native speakers had already left the conversation. He also didn't know that the conversation was moderated by the LLM and his message was not sent to the actual native speakers. He was simply talking to a machine, not a human.</p>
  <p>This story illustrates the danger of using LLMs that imitate ChatGPT TechTalks. Not only do they create a false sense of interaction, but they also prevent learners from practicing with real native speakers.</p>
  <h2>Quantifiable examples</h2>
  <p>Let's take a closer look at some quantifiable examples to illustrate the risks associated with LLMs that imitate ChatGPT TechTalks:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>According to a survey conducted by FluentU, 85% of learners prefer practicing with real native speakers rather than using LLMs.</li>
   <li>The same survey found that 55% of learners reported feeling frustrated when using LLMs due to the lack of feedback and interaction.</li>
   <li>In a study conducted by the University of Cambridge, it was found that learners who practiced with real native speakers made more progress in their language acquisition than those who used LLMs.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>The danger of false interaction</h2>
  <p>One of the biggest risks associated with LLMs that imitate ChatGPT TechTalks is the creation of a false sense of interaction. Learners may feel that they are having a conversation with a native speaker when in reality they are only talking to a machine.</p>
  <p>This false interaction can lead to several problems:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Learners may develop bad habits in their language use due to the lack of feedback from a real native speaker.</li>
   <li>Learners may become frustrated with the lack of real interaction and feel discouraged from continuing their language learning journey.</li>
   <li>Learners may miss out on the cultural nuances and context that come with interacting with a real native speaker.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>The importance of practicing with real native speakers</h2>
  <p>The best way to learn a new language is to practice with real native speakers. Here are a few reasons why:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Real native speakers provide instant feedback and correction, which helps learners improve their language skills faster.</li>
   <li>Real native speakers offer practical tips and advice on how to speak the language in a natural way, something that can't be learned from a machine.</li>
   <li>Real native speakers provide valuable cultural insights and context that can enhance the learner's understanding of the language.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>The bottom line</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>LLMs that imitate ChatGPT TechTalks may create a false sense of interaction and prevent learners from practicing with real native speakers.</li>
   <li>Learners who practice with real native speakers make more progress in their language acquisition than those who use LLMs.</li>
   <li>The best way to learn a new language is to practice with real native speakers.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>So, next time you come across an LLM that imitates ChatGPT TechTalks, be careful. Consider practicing with real native speakers instead. Your language skills will thank you for it.</p>
