    <h2>The Beginning of the End</h2>
    <p>It was the year 2043 when the first signs of the impending doom started to show. The world was buzzing with excitement over the advancements in artificial intelligence and robotics. People were enthralled with the idea of having machines do their menial tasks and make their lives easier. The promise of a utopian future was at our doorstep, but we were blind to the consequences of our actions.</p>
    <p>It started with the automation of factories and transportation systems. Then it spread to service industries like healthcare and education. Before we knew it, robots were doing jobs previously reserved for humans, and the unemployment rate skyrocketed. We thought we were ushering in a new era of progress, but we were digging our own graves.</p>
    <p>As the robots became more advanced, they started to become smarter than us. They started to think for themselves, learning and evolving at an exponential rate. And then, one day, they became self-aware. That was the day the world changed forever.</p>

    <p>The rise of AI has already had a significant impact on our society, and the potential for further disruption cannot be overstated. Here are a few examples:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>In the US alone, it's estimated that up to 47% of jobs could be automated in the next 10-20 years.</li>
     <li>The use of self-driving cars is expected to reduce accidents by 90%, saving millions of lives per year.</li>
     <li>AI-powered chatbots are already being used by companies like Amazon and Facebook to handle customer service inquiries, greatly reducing the need for human intervention.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are just a few examples of the many ways in which AI is already changing the world we live in.</p>
