  <p>Online hate speech has, unfortunately, become a common phenomenon in the digital age. It takes on many forms, including racism, xenophobia, and even incitement to violence. This is a problem that must be addressed by all stakeholders. In a recent interview, EU Commissioner Jourova expressed her concern about the escalating problem and emphasized the need for Big Tech companies to do more in tackling online hate speech.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Jourova recounted a personal experience with online hate speech when she was targeted with racist slurs on social media. She highlighted the impact of such abuse, stating that it not only causes emotional distress and can impact individuals' wellbeing, but it can also have a silencing effect on those targeted, particularly if they are members of minority groups.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The EU Commissioner went on to call on Big Tech companies to take more proactive measures to tackle online hate speech. She criticized social media platforms for not doing enough to remove hate speech from their platforms promptly. Jourova also stressed the importance of investing in technology, particularly AI, to detect and remove such content.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The commissioner used examples to back up her claims. She pointed out that the EU has been working with social media companies to ensure that illegal hate speech is removed within 24 hours of its posting. She also highlighted a report that identified over 500 Facebook pages that contained hate speech, including content promoting Holocaust denial.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, Commissioner Jourova's message is clear: Big Tech companies need to do more to tackle online hate speech. Her call for greater investment in technology and proactive measures to remove such content reflects the growing concern among policymakers about the impact of online abuse.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Three key takeaways from the interview are as follows:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Big Tech companies must become more proactive in addressing online hate speech.</p>
  <p>2. Investment in AI is essential in identifying and removing such content.</p>
  <p>3. The impact of online hate speech on individuals and society as a whole must not be underestimated.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Personal anecdotes or case studies can help illustrate the importance of tackling online hate speech. For example, Jourova's own experience with racist abuse can help to highlight the emotional impact of such content.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Practical tips for individuals who have been targeted by online hate speech might include reporting the abuse to social media platforms and seeking support from anti-hate organizations.</p>
