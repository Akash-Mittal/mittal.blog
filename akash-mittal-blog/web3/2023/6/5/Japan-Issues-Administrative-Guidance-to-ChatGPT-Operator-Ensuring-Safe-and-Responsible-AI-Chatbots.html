  <p></p>
  <p>It was a typical Monday morning when I decided to try out a new chatbot AI tool. The chatbot, named ChatGPT, is a renowned AI tool popular for generating human-like responses to users' queries. From the onset, I was fascinated with its ability to converse and mimic human intelligence. However, as I gradually familiarized myself with the tool, I began to realize some ethical concerns. The machine algorithm was generating biased and discriminatory responses, which was alarming.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Apparently, I wasn't alone in my concerns. Japan, like many other countries, has recognized the growing importance of AI and the need to regulate it. In 2019, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) issued "Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI," which outlines the ethical principles and best practices for the development and utilization of AI. Recently, the METI issued Administrative Guidance to ChatGPT and other Chatbot operators to ensure that their AI chatbots meet the ethical principles highlighted in the Ethics Guidelines.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable Examples</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>According to a survey conducted by NTTCom Online Marketing Solutions Corporation, a Japanese digital marketing agency, over 90% of Japanese companies use or plan to leverage AI in their businesses. Similarly, a report by the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence revealed that while AI algorithms were generally unbiased, they tend to learn from biased data. Therefore, there is a need to develop ethical and responsible AI systems.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The METI's Administrative Guidance focuses specifically on ensuring the ethical development and utilization of AI by Chatbot operators. The guidelines require Chatbot developers to ensure that their AI chatbots are transparent, explainable, and human-centric. Additionally, Chatbot operators must ensure that their AI is free from bias and discrimination. These guidelines apply to both private and public sectors in Japan.</p>

  <p>Conclusion in Three Points</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. The development and utilization of AI in Japan are on the rise, with over 90% of companies already using or planning to leverage AI in their operations.</p>
  <p>2. To ensure the ethical and responsible development and utilization of AI, Japan's METI has issued Administrative Guidance to Chatbot operators, requiring them to develop AI that is transparent, explainable, and human-centric and free from bias and discrimination.</p>
  <p>3. The guidance highlights the growing need to regulate AI and ensure that it serves the best interests of society, without causing harm or discrimination.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Personal Anecdote</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>While the guidelines are a step in the right direction, there is a need for continuous monitoring and evaluation to ensure that Chatbot operators adhere to them. Additionally, more comprehensive measures are needed to address other concerns related to the utilization of AI, such as privacy and security.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>As someone who frequently uses AI chatbots in my daily life, I believe that ethical and responsible development and utilization of AI is crucial. The METI's guidelines come at a time when concerns over AI's impact on society are growing globally. Therefore, it is imperative that all stakeholders in the AI industry work together to develop and implement effective ethical and regulatory frameworks for AI.</p>
