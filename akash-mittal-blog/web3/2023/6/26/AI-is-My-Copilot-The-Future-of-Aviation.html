   <h2>Story</h2>
   <p>Imagine yourself as a pilot on a long flight – a journey of thousands of kilometers with no one to talk to or share your experience. You have just one option left – your copilot. But what if your copilot was not human, and instead was an AI system that could communicate with you and assist you in your duties? Welcome to the future of aviation, where AI is your copilot.</p>

  <section id="examples">
   <h2>Examples</h2>
   <p>The use of AI as a copilot has been gaining traction in recent years. JetBlue became the first airline to use AI-powered autopilot systems in 2017. The system is designed to monitor the aircraft's movements and to make calculations based on the data provided. This innovation has helped to reduce the workload of pilots and has increased the efficiency of flight operations.</p>
   <p>Another example is Boeing's 737 Max aircraft, which is equipped with an AI-powered system called MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System). The system is designed to adjust the aircraft's horizontal stabilizer to ensure it remains balanced. The MCAS became the focus of attention following two crashes involving the 737 Max, raising questions about the safety of AI in aviation.</p>
   <p>Despite the controversies, AI has continued to win over many pilots and aviation enthusiasts. AI has demonstrated excellent performance in a variety of automated systems, including autopilot and intelligent navigation. Pilots have reported improved situational awareness and decision-making from the use of AI technology.</p>
