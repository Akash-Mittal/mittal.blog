  <p>It was a crisp morning in Bangalore, and as usual, I was sipping my coffee while scrolling through my social media feeds. As I was browsing, I came across an interesting article that said, "Own ChatGPT skills? Companies may pay up to Rs 1.5 crore to hire you." At that moment, I was stunned. I always knew that ChatGPT was a critical emerging technology, but I didn't realize the real earning potential it had.</p>
