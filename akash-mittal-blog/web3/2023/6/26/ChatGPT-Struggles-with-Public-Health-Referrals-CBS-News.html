   <!-- Start with a story -->
   <p>ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot designed to provide medical advice and referrals to patients who may not have access to healthcare professionals. While it may seem like a useful tool to help patients get the care they need, a new study has found that ChatGPT may not be performing as well as expected when it comes to public health referrals.</p>
   <p>According to a report by CBS News, researchers from Northeastern University and Harvard University tested ChatGPT's ability to identify local public health resources across seven U.S. states. The study found that ChatGPT only correctly identified the correct local resources 30% of the time, and in some cases, referred users to resources that were either outside their geographic area or not applicable to their needs.</p><!-- Add some examples -->
   <p>This misdirection could be particularly dangerous during the COVID-19 pandemic as individuals may be referred to testing centers that are not equipped to handle their specific needs.</p>
   <p>While ChatGPT was able to provide some level of guidance to those who may not have access to healthcare professionals, its inadequacies highlight the challenges that come with relying solely on AI technology in healthcare. The study authors suggest that healthcare providers should be involved in developing and testing these AI tools.</p><!-- Include personal anecdotes or case studies -->
   <p>One example of how AI technology can fall short in providing healthcare advice is demonstrated in a case study from the Journal of Medical Internet Research. The study found that an AI chatbot designed to provide mental health support to college students overestimated the severity of depression in some cases and failed to provide appropriate referrals.</p>
   <p>Despite the limitations of AI tools like ChatGPT, they can still be helpful in providing basic information to patients. However, it is important for patients and healthcare providers to recognize the limitations of these tools and use them in conjunction with in-person medical care.</p><!-- Add in tips -->
   <h2>Tips for using AI healthcare tools</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Always verify the information provided by an AI tool with a healthcare professional</li>
    <li>When using an AI tool to find local resources, double-check that the resources provided are within your geographic area and relevant to your needs</li>
    <li>Keep in mind that AI tools are not a replacement for in-person medical care</li>
   </ul><!-- Add in conclusion in 3 points -->
   <h2>In conclusion,</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>While AI healthcare tools like ChatGPT can provide basic information, they may not be reliable for referrals to public health resources</li>
    <li>Clinical experts should be involved in developing and testing these AI tools to ensure accuracy and reliability</li>
    <li>Patients and healthcare providers should use AI tools in conjunction with in-person medical care to ensure the best possible outcomes</li>
