    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>On Tuesday, November 24, 2020, Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a widespread outage, causing major disruptions to numerous websites and services. The outage was caused by a power outage at one of AWS's data centers in Northern Virginia, which then caused a cascading effect on other data centers. The outage lasted for approximately three hours and impacted websites such as Netflix, Adobe, and Roku.</p>
    <p>According to reports, the outage caused an estimated loss of $40 million for AWS's customers. This outage highlighted the importance of having a backup plan for businesses that rely heavily on cloud services like AWS.</p>
