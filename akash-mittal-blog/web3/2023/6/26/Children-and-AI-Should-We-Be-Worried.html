     <h2>Story</h2>
     <p>When I was a child, the idea of robots and artificial intelligence was something straight out of science fiction. But now, it's a reality that's woven into our daily lives. And as a parent, I can't help but wonder what impact it's having on my children.</p>

    <section id="examples">
     <h2>Examples</h2>
     <p>The use of artificial intelligence algorithms to profile children's behaviour online has become increasingly common, with companies collecting data on everything from a child's level of interest in certain topics to their social media activity. This data can be used to build highly detailed profiles of individual children, which can then be sold to marketers or used to target them with ads.</p>
     <p>Another area where AI is having a big impact on children is in education. AI-powered tools are being used to tailor lesson plans to individual students' needs, which can be a great way to ensure that every child is getting the support they need. But there are concerns that the use of these tools could lead to teachers becoming less involved in the education process, which could have a negative impact on students' overall development.</p>
     <p>Of course, there are also concerns about the dangers of exposing children to AI in the first place. Some experts worry that children could become overly reliant on AI-powered devices, which could lead to them losing important social and cognitive skills that are developed through real-world interactions with other people.</p>

     <h2>Conclusion</h2>
     <ol>
      <li>AI has the potential to revolutionize education and improve the lives of children, but it's important that we approach it with caution and ensure that it's being used in a responsible way.</li>
      <li>We need to be mindful of the dangers of AI, such as the potential loss of social and cognitive skills, and work to mitigate these risks.</li>
      <li>Ultimately, the key to ensuring that AI is a positive force for children is to strike a balance between embracing its potential and being aware of its potential dangers.</li>
