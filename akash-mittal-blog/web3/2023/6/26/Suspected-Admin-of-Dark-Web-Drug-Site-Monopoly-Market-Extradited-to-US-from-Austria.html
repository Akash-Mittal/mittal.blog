    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>John Smith, a 28-year-old American citizen, was arrested in Austria on suspicion of being the admin of the dark web drug site Monopoly Market. The arrest was the result of a joint operation between the US and Austrian authorities, who had been investigating the site for months.</p>
    <p>Monopoly Market was a popular dark web site that allowed users to buy and sell illegal drugs, as well as other illegal goods such as guns and fake documents. The site operated on the dark web, making it difficult for authorities to track down its owners and users.</p>
    <p>Smith had been living in Austria for several years, using the country as a base to run his illegal operation. However, the authorities eventually caught up with him, and he was extradited to the US to face trial.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>The case of John Smith is just one example of the growing problem of online drug markets. The dark web has allowed drug dealers to sell their wares anonymously, making it difficult for authorities to track them down and shut them down.</p>
    <p>Other examples include the closure of the dark web site Silk Road in 2013, which was at the time the largest online drug market in the world. The founder of the site, Ross Ulbricht, was eventually arrested and sentenced to life in prison.</p>
    <p>However, despite the closure of sites like Silk Road and Monopoly Market, new dark web marketplaces continue to emerge. This is a testament to the resilience of the online drug trade, which shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.</p>
