  <p>The gaming industry is a fast-growing sector of the digital economy. With technological advancements such as blockchain, gaming is evolving to a whole new level. In this article, we explore the story of HyperPlay, which has raised $12 million to accelerate its web3 game launcher.</p>
  <h2>The Story of HyperPlay</h2>
  <p>HyperPlay is a Singapore-based blockchain gaming company that aims to redefine the gaming experience with the use of blockchain technology. HyperPlay has raised $12 million in a Series A funding round, led by some of the most prestigious venture capital firms such as Animoca Brands, Singapore Press Holdings, and Breyer Capital.</p>
  <p>The funding will be used to accelerate the development of the HyperPlay game launcher, which seeks to provide a seamless bridge between the world of blockchain and traditional gaming. The HyperPlay game launcher will enable players to access blockchain games and decentralized applications (dApps) through a user-friendly interface, creating unique gaming experiences that were previously unavailable.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Web3 Gaming</h2>
  <p>The gaming industry is no stranger to technological revolution. The introduction of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) have transformed the gaming experience. But, web3 gaming takes things even further.</p>
  <p>Web3 games utilize blockchain technology, which allows for unique features such as ownership of in-game assets, true digital scarcity, and decentralization, among others. In web3 gaming, players have true ownership of their in-game assets, which can be transferred and traded with other players, creating an entirely new economy within the gaming industry.</p>
  <p>One example of a successful web3 game is Axie Infinity. Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based game that has become extremely popular in recent months. In Axie Infinity, players breed and battle digital creatures called Axies, which are tradeable and have real-world value. The gaming experience is unique, with players earning cryptocurrency by winning battles and completing in-game tasks.</p>
