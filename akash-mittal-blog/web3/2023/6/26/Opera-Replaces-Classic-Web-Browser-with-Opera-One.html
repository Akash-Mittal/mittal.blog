    <p>Once upon a time, there was a classic web browser called Opera that had been around for more than two decades. It was well known for its speed, security, and innovative features. However, as time passed, the world of web browsing evolved, and the classic Opera browser became outdated. People demanded more advanced features, more customization options, and more integrated tools.</p>
    <p>Therefore, the Opera team decided to create a new browser from scratch, one that would meet the modern demands of web users. And that is how Opera One was born. This new browser integrates a lot of advanced features, including built-in ad blocker, VPN, and crypto wallet.</p>
