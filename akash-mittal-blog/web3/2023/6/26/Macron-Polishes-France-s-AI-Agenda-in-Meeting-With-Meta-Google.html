    <h2>Examples of AI Application in France</h2>
    <p>France has already demonstrated significant initiatives in AI, with the creation of the French AI National Strategy in 2018 being one example. This strategy aims to invest €1.5 billion in the French AI ecosystem by 2022, and to train 10,000 students and professionals in AI-related subjects.</p>
    <p>French tech companies are also at the forefront of developing AI solutions in various fields. For instance, Sanofi, a French pharmaceutical company, has been using AI algorithms to accelerate drug discovery and develop precision medicine. Airbus, a major French aerospace company, is leveraging AI to optimize flight routes and reduce fuel consumption, thus contributing to sustainability.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, France is home to incubators and research centers that foster AI innovation. For example, Station F, the world's largest startup campus located in Paris, hosts AI-specific programs such as Big Data and AI by Microsoft and AI Factory by Facebook. In addition, the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) has a research department focused on AI and machine learning, which has developed cutting-edge applications in domains such as cybersecurity and quantum computing.</p>
