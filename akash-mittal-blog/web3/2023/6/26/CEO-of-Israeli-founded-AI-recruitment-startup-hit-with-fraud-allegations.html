  <p>It was just another day for John, a software engineer, until he received an email from his recruiter, telling him that his dream job was just a few steps away. The recruiter promised John a high-paying job at an AI recruitment startup, which is backed by investors from Silicon Valley. Without hesitating even for a moment, John agreed to attend the interview. The interview went well and John was offered the job on the spot, but little did he know that he was walking right into a trap.</p>
  <p>According to recent allegations, the CEO of the AI recruitment startup John applied to has been accused of fraud. The CEO was caught faking contracts in order to receive investments from multiple investors. The startup, which was supposed to help companies recruit top talent using AI and machine learning algorithms, was instead just a front for the CEO's fraudulent activities.</p>
  <h2>Examples of how the fraud affected people</h2>
  <p>The CEO's fraudulent activities not only affected the investors but also the job seekers like John who were lured into this trap. Job seekers went through multiple rounds of interviews, invested their time and effort, and even quit their existing jobs, only to find out that the company was not a legitimate one. They were left stranded without jobs, and with a sense of betrayal and frustration.</p>
  <p>The startup's employees were not spared either. One of the employees, who did not wish to be named, shared his experience of how the CEO would constantly delay their salaries and manipulate them into working for longer hours. The employees were asked to work on weekends without being compensated for their extra time. Some of the employees even quit their jobs due to the constant harassment.</p>
