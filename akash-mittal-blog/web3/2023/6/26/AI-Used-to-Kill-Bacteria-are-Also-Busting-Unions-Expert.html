    <p>Janet worked at a large food processing plant for over a decade. Most of her fellow employees were part of the union, just like she was. One day, Janet arrived at work to find out that her job had been automated. The company had implemented an AI system to kill bacteria, and her position was no longer necessary.</p>
    <p>Janet wasn't alone. Many of her coworkers also found themselves out of a job, and the union's attempts to protect them were unsuccessful. The company argued that the AI system would increase efficiency and reduce the risk of foodborne illness.</p>
    <p>While it's true that AI technology can effectively kill bacteria, it's also having negative consequences on unions. As more and more companies implement automated systems, unions are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their members.</p>
    <h2>Examples of AI in Action</h2>
    <p>AI technology has been used in a variety of industries to kill bacteria. In the healthcare industry, for example, robots can disinfect hospital rooms using UV light. In the food industry, companies are implementing AI systems to detect and remove contaminated products.</p>
    <p>One example is Chorley-based company Provenance Biopharmaceuticals, which is using a combination of AI and CRISPR gene-editing technology to develop new antibiotics. By automating the process of identifying antibiotics that can effectively kill specific bacteria, Provenance hopes to revolutionize the way antibiotics are developed and help combat the growing problem of antibiotic resistance.</p>
    <h2>The Negative Impact on Unions</h2>
    <p>While AI technology can certainly improve efficiency and reduce foodborne illness, it's also having a negative impact on unions. As companies implement these systems, jobs are being automated, and union members are losing their positions. Some companies are even using AI systems to monitor employees and prevent union activity, further eroding union power.</p>
    <p>Unions are fighting back, but they face an uphill battle. With automation continuing to advance, it's more important than ever for unions to adapt and find new ways to protect their members. This may mean focusing on job training and education, rather than simply trying to protect specific positions.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>AI technology is revolutionizing the way bacteria are killed, but it's also having a negative effect on unions. As more and more companies implement automated systems, unions are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their members. However, unions can adapt by focusing on job training and education, which will help their members prepare for the jobs of the future.</p>
