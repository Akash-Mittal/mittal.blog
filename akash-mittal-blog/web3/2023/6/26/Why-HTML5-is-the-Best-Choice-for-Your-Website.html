    <h2>A Story</h2>
    <p>When I started my first website in the early 2000s, HTML was the go-to language for web design. However, as the years went by, technologies changed. Websites became more complex and needed more versatile languages to handle them. That's when I discovered HTML5, and it changed everything for me.</p>

    <h2>What is HTML5?</h2>
    <p>HTML5 is the successor to HTML4, the language that has been used for web design since the dawn of the internet. HTML5 is a more versatile, efficient and feature-rich language that gives designers the ability to create more complex websites with ease.</p>
    <p>HTML5 is more than just an evolution of HTML4. It is a complete rewrite of the language that includes new elements, attributes, and features that make it a significant improvement over its predecessor.</p>
