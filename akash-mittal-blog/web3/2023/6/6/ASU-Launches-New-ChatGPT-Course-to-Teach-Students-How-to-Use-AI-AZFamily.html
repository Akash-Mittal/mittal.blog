   <p>Imagine a world where you could talk to your computer, and it would understand everything you said. A world where you could ask it to help you plan your day, answer questions you have, or even chat with you like a friend. That's the world of artificial intelligence, or AI. And now, Arizona State University is helping students learn how to use AI with their new course, ChatGPT.</p>
   
   <p>ChatGPT uses state-of-the-art language models to help students learn how to build and use AI chatbots. As part of the course, students work on a project where they create their own chatbot from scratch. They start by training their chatbot to answer simple questions, like "What's the weather like today?" Then they move on to more complex requests, like "Help me find a new restaurant to try."</p>
   <p>One of the benefits of ChatGPT is that it's designed to be practical. Students aren't just learning about AI in theory; they're actually building something that can be used in the real world. And the results have been impressive. In a recent study, ASU students who took the ChatGPT course reported significantly higher confidence in their ability to use AI compared to those who did not take the course. They also reported feeling more prepared for a future where AI is increasingly important.</p>
   <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
   <p>One student, Sarah, took the ChatGPT course last semester. She had never worked with AI before, but she was excited to learn. "I was blown away by how much I was able to create in just a few weeks," she says. "By the end of the course, I had built a chatbot that could help people find local volunteer opportunities. It was really satisfying to see something I had created actually being used to help others."</p>
   <p>Another student, Josh, had a similar experience. "Before taking the course, I thought AI was something only experts could do," he says. "But the ChatGPT course made it accessible and fun. I was able to build a chatbot for my family's small business that helps customers find the products they're looking for. It's been a huge success."</p>
