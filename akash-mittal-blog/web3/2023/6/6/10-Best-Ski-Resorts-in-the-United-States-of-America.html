    <h2>A Tale of Two Skiers</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time, there were two friends who loved hitting the slopes. They had both grown up skiing on small hills and slopes, but they had always dreamed of experiencing the majesty of the Rocky Mountains. So, they decided to plan a ski trip to Colorado to make their dream a reality.</p>
    <p>Friend one did some research on popular ski resorts in Colorado and booked a room at one of the most popular resorts. Friend two, however, did some more digging and found a lesser-known resort with fewer crowds and more affordable prices.</p>
    <p>After their trips, they reconvened to compare notes. Friend one had a good time but found that the crowds made it hard to fully enjoy the skiing experience. Friend two, on the other hand, had the time of their life on the un-crowded slopes, and they even made some new ski buddies in the process.</p>
    <p>This story illustrates an important point: when it comes to ski resorts, bigger isn't always better. In fact, some of the best skiing experiences can be found at smaller, lesser-known resorts.</p>
