   <p>Do you remember Microsoft's chatbot Tay, which turned racist and sexist within 24 hours of its launch? That was a major embarrassment for the tech giant, and also a valuable lesson for the AI community - building intelligent software is not easy, and it requires a lot of testing and validation to ensure that it behaves properly in the real world.</p>
   <p>OpenAI, the AI research organization co-founded by Elon Musk, knows this lesson very well. After launching a few AI-powered products for the consumer market, including a language model called GPT-3 that can generate human-like text, OpenAI announced recently that it won't build any more consumer products, except for ChatGPT - a conversational AI that powers chatbots for businesses.</p>
   <p>There are many reasons behind this decision, and in this article, we'll explore some of them.</p>

  <main>
   <h2>Quantifiable examples</h2>
   <p>OpenAI has been experimenting with AI for many years, and it has created some impressive technologies that showcase the potential of this field. However, not all of these technologies are suitable for the consumer market, for various reasons:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>GPT-2:</strong> A powerful language model that can generate coherent text, but also has the potential to generate fake news and propaganda.</li>
    <li><strong>DALL-E:</strong> A neural network that can generate images from textual descriptions, but also can be used to create pornographic or violent content.</li>
    <li><strong>Rubiqa:</strong> A system that can play poker at a professional level, but it requires a lot of computational resources and has limited real-world applications.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>These examples show that AI technologies can be both impressive and dangerous, and that they need to be carefully tested and validated before they can be released to the public. OpenAI has recognized this challenge, and it has decided to focus on more niche applications of AI, such as conversational AI for businesses.</p>
   <h2>Eye-catching title</h2>
   <p>The decision of OpenAI to abandon the consumer market is a bold and strategic move, and it has sparked a lot of discussion in the AI community. Some people argue that OpenAI is giving up on a lucrative market that has the potential to transform many industries, while others see it as a sensible decision that reflects the complexity of building reliable and ethical AI products.</p>
   <p>Whatever your opinion is, it's clear that OpenAI's decision has important implications for the future of AI and its applications. By focusing on chatbots for businesses, OpenAI is betting on a market that has a huge potential for growth, and that also has a lower risk of negative consequences, compared to the consumer market.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion in 3 points</h2>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Building consumer products with AI is risky:</strong> As we have seen with Microsoft's Tay, AI-powered chatbots can behave in unexpected and undesirable ways, which can harm the reputation of the company and the trust of the customers.</li>
    <li><strong>Niche applications of AI are safer and more profitable:</strong> By focusing on specific industries and use cases, AI companies can create products that are more reliable, effective, and profitable, without risking the negative consequences of releasing them to the general public.</li>
    <li><strong>AI needs more regulation and validation:</strong> As AI becomes more ubiquitous and powerful, it also becomes more challenging to ensure that it behaves ethically and responsibly. Governments and industry leaders need to work together to establish standards and best practices for testing and validating AI products, and to ensure that they are aligned with the needs and values of society.</li>
   </ul>
