  <h1>How Chinese quants are redoubling AI bets amid ChatGPT frenzy</h1> <img src="images/How-Chinese-quants-are-redoubling-AI-bets-amid-ChatGPT-frenzy.jpeg" alt="+How-Chinese-quants-are-redoubling-AI-bets-amid-ChatGPT-frenzy+">
  <p>When a group of Chinese programmers built a simple chatbot in 2015, they had no idea that it would become one of the hottest topics in AI research. The chatbot, named XiaoIce, was designed to simulate the personality of a teenage girl and engage in conversations with users. But it soon became clear that XiaoIce was more than just a toy – it was a breakthrough in natural language processing (NLP) that promised to transform the way we interact with machines.</p>
  <p>Since then, Chinese quants have been at the forefront of NLP research, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI-powered chatbots. And now, with the rise of OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models, they're redoubling their efforts to create smarter, more human-like chatbots that can understand and respond to complex queries in real-time.</p>
  <h2>Quantifiable examples of ChatGPT frenzy</h2>
  <p>The ChatGPT frenzy is best illustrated by the rapid growth of the Chinese chatbot market in recent years. According to a report by QuestMobile, a Chinese mobile data intelligence firm, the number of monthly active users (MAU) of chatbots in China grew from just 1.3 million in 2014 to 460 million in 2020 – a phenomenal increase of 35,000% in just six years.</p>
  <p>Another example of the ChatGPT frenzy is the popularity of Chinese chatbot platforms like Xiaoice and DuerOS. Xiaoice, which was developed by Microsoft Asia, has over 660 million users worldwide and can engage in conversations on a wide range of topics, from weather to cooking to dating. DuerOS, on the other hand, has over 400 million users and is designed to be integrated into everything from smart speakers to cars to refrigerators.</p>
  <p>According to a report by Goldman Sachs, the Chinese chatbot market is expected to grow from $1 billion in 2018 to $29 billion by 2025, driven by the rising demand for intelligent virtual assistants that can help users navigate a variety of tasks and services.</p>
  <h2>Redoubling AI bets</h2>
  <p>Chinese quants are redoubling their AI bets in response to the ChatGPT frenzy, investing heavily in research and development (R&amp;D) to create chatbots that can not only understand and respond to natural language queries, but also generate their own language and engage in creative tasks like storytelling and poetry.</p>
  <p>One example of this is the "Dreamwriter" project developed by researchers at Tsinghua University, which uses a GPT-2 model to generate poetry based on various prompts and themes. Another example is the "OneNet" AI assistant developed by Tencent, which can communicate with users in natural language and perform a variety of tasks like booking flights and ordering food.</p>
  <p>According to a recent report by the China Artificial Intelligence Development Report 2021, China's AI industry is expected to reach $66 billion by 2025, with the chatbot market playing a significant role in driving growth and innovation.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion in 3 points</h2>
  <p>1. The ChatGPT frenzy is driving the rapid growth of the Chinese chatbot market, with millions of users now regularly interacting with AI-powered chatbots.</p>
  <p>2. Chinese quants are redoubling their AI bets, investing heavily in research and development to create more human-like chatbots that can understand and respond to natural language queries in real-time.</p>
  <p>3. With the chatbot market expected to grow rapidly in the coming years, China is well-positioned to lead the way in AI-powered virtual assistants and transform the way we interact with machines.</p>
