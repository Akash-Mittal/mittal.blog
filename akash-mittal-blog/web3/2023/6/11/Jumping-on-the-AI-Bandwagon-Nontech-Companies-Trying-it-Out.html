   <h2>A Story of AI in Nontech Companies</h2>
   <p>Once upon a time, AI seemed like something only tech giants could afford and develop. But as the technology becomes more accessible and the potential benefits more widely known, nontech companies are jumping on the bandwagon.</p>
   <p>For example, Campbell's Soup Company recently announced that it's using AI to predict which of its products will sell best and optimize its supply chain accordingly. This move is expected to save the company millions of dollars annually.</p>
   <p>And Campbell's isn't alone. Retailers like Kohl's are using AI to personalize shopping experiences for customers, while airlines like Delta are using it to improve maintenance schedules for their planes.</p>
   <p>But why now? One reason is that the cost of AI technology has decreased significantly in recent years, making it more accessible to smaller businesses. Additionally, the benefits of AI are becoming more widely known and accepted, leading to increased adoption.</p>
   <h2>Examples of AI in Action</h2>
   <p>Let's take a closer look at some nontech companies that are using AI and the benefits they're seeing:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Campbell's Soup Company:</strong> As mentioned before, Campbell's is using AI to predict which products will sell best and optimize its supply chain. This has led to increased efficiency and cost savings.</li>
    <li><strong>Kohl's:</strong> The retailer is using AI to personalize the shopping experience for customers. By analyzing customer data, Kohl's can provide personalized product recommendations and pricing to each customer.</li>
    <li><strong>Delta:</strong> The airline is using AI to improve maintenance schedules for its planes. By analyzing data on the performance of each plane, Delta can predict when maintenance is needed and schedule it accordingly, reducing downtime and increasing safety.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2></h2>

    <li>AI isn't just for tech companies anymore. Nontech businesses are finding that they can benefit greatly from AI, from optimizing supply chains to personalizing customer experiences.</li>
    <li>The cost of AI technology has decreased, making it more accessible to smaller businesses.</li>
    <li>The benefits of AI are becoming more widely known and accepted, leading to increased adoption in all types of businesses.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>A Personal Anecdote</h2>
   <p>I work for a mid-sized manufacturing company that recently implemented an AI-powered predictive maintenance system. Before this, we had a reactive approach to maintenance, fixing problems as they occurred. This led to downtime and increased costs. But with the new system, we're able to predict when maintenance is needed and proactively schedule it. This has led to increased efficiency and cost savings.</p>
