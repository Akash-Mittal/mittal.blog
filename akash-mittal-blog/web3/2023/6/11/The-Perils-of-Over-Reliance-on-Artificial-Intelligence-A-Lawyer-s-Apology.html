  <p>It's not uncommon for lawyers to turn to technology to make their jobs easier. However, not everything that glitters is gold. Sometimes, employing artificial intelligence can backfire spectacularly, as was the case for me. I allowed an advanced language model known as ChatGPT to generate fabricated cases for a crucial court filing, and things didn't turn out the way I planned.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Let me tell you the story of how I ended up apologizing for relying too much on ChatGPT. I had an upcoming court appearance that required me to submit a significant volume of case law and rulings to the judge. With my workload piling up, I decided to give ChatGPT a shot. My strategy was simple: I would input some keywords, and the AI would create cases related to my search terms. I thought I had hit the jackpot when, within minutes, ChatGPT produced over 200 unique cases. Excited by the prospect of saving hours of work, I submitted the list to the judge.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>To my horror, the judge found out that many of the cases were fabricated and reprimanded me in open court. It turned out that ChatGPT had generated false verdicts and rulings that did not exist in any legal database. As a result, my credibility was severely undermined, and the trust the judge had in me was lost. Later, upon review, I found that this was a common phenomenon of AI systems. They make inferences based on the data presented to them.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This experience taught me a valuable lesson - although AI is a powerful tool, it is not without limitations, and it should never be blindly relied upon. In fact, this holds true for all advanced tech because it still lacks the subtleties and discretion of a human mind. The consequences of misusing such tools can range from embarrassing to outright disastrous. Here are three takeaways I have learned from this episode that are worth sharing.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>First, there is no substitute for human judgment, expertise, and intuition. As much as we'd like to simplify our lives with fancy tools, there are aspects of legal work that require human insight and the ability to evaluate nuance. Just a glimpse into the future of AI-generated news reporting will show us how important the human touch is.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Second, as tempting as it may be to save time by delegating work to AI systems, it is crucial to check the results before submitting them to a human audience. Automated solutions can only go so far in ensuring accuracy and quality, and human oversight is necessary to prevent errors and ensure ethical standards.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Third, it's crucial to acknowledge the limitations of AI and work towards developing regulatory frameworks to ensure that these systems are accurate, transparent, and ethical. This will benefit society as a whole, as we face increasing automation and AI reliance in various fields.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, my reliance on AI for the court filing landed me in a considerable amount of trouble. Still, my mistake served as a valuable lesson that I hope to pass on to others. AI has transformative potential, but it must be approached with care, restraint, and transparency. Only in this way can lawyers and other professionals leverage its power for good, without jeopardizing their credibility and reputation.</p>
