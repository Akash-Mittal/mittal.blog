  <p>On a long enough timeline, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero. This famous quote from the movie Fight Club may sound grim, but it is a fact of life that emphasizes the importance of making the most out of our time. In today's world, we see that the ones who are making the most of their time are students and the wealthy. They are the ones leading the charge in innovation, progress, and societal change.</p>
  <h2>The Story</h2>
  <p>Let me tell you a story about a young college student named Jane who stood up against the government's discriminatory policy towards immigrants. Being the daughter of immigrant parents, she could not stand idly by while her fellow students were being turned away from the university because of their nationality. She led a social media campaign that went viral and created a petition that got thousands of signatures. Her persistence and courage paid off, and the government eventually overturned the policy. Her actions inspired countless others and made a real difference in people's lives.</p>
  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p>Likewise, many wealthy individuals are using their power and influence to drive positive change. Take Elon Musk, for example. His ambitious goal of making humans an inter-planetary species has captured the world's imagination and has the potential to revolutionize space travel. His company SpaceX has already made tremendous strides towards this goal, with the successful launch of the Falcon Heavy rocket being just one example.</p>
  <p>Another example is Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and one of the wealthiest people on the planet. Bezos has announced a $10 billion pledge to combat climate change through his new philanthropic initiative, the Bezos Earth Fund. This kind of concerted effort from the world's wealthiest individuals is critical in tackling global issues like climate change.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>Students and the wealthy are leading the way in innovation, progress, and societal change.</li>
   <li>Their actions are inspiring others and making a real difference in people's lives.</li>
   <li>We should encourage and support those who are pushing boundaries and making a positive impact in the world.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>As someone who has witnessed firsthand the power of youth activism and philanthropy, I cannot stress enough how important it is to recognize and applaud those who are leading the way towards a brighter future. Whether you are a student or a wealthy individual, the potential for positive change is within your reach.</p>
