    <p>On Friday, a Lutheran church in Germany made headlines for a unique sermon that was delivered via artificial intelligence. While some people found it fascinating, others were quick to label it as a sign of the "end times" and the rise of the Antichrist or Beast system.</p>
    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>The AI chatbot, created by a Berlin-based startup called Nautober, was programmed to deliver a sermon based on the biblical text of 1 Corinthians chapter 13. The robot, named BlessU-2, was equipped with a projector, speakers, and an audio player that enabled it to deliver its message in different languages.</p>
    <p>BlessU-2 greeted churchgoers as they entered the church, asking them if they wanted to receive a blessing or hear a sermon. If they chose the latter, the robot would then proceed to deliver a pre-recorded message that lasted around six minutes. The message was accompanied by projector images and music that were meant to enhance the spiritual experience.</p>
    <p>The reactions to BlessU-2 were mixed. Some people were impressed by the novelty of it all, while others found it creepy and unsettling. However, those who were quick to label it as a sign of the end times or the Antichrist were mostly from outside of the church community.</p>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>The rise of technology and artificial intelligence has always been a topic of concern for some religious groups, who see it as a threat to traditional values and beliefs. However, the use of AI in a religious context is not new.</p>
    <p>In 2017, a Buddhist temple in Beijing unveiled a robot monk named Xian'er, which was designed to teach Buddhist philosophy and meditate. The robot was equipped with facial recognition technology and could interact with humans in a lifelike manner.</p>
    <p>Similarly, the Israeli startup, Aleph Farms, has announced plans to create lab-grown meat from animal cells, which could potentially revolutionize the food industry. However, some religious groups have expressed concerns about the ethical implications of this technology.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The use of artificial intelligence in religion is not inherently good or evil. Like any technology, it depends on how it is used and for what purpose. For some churches, AI could be a tool to enhance the spiritual experience of its members and attract new ones. For others, it could be seen as a threat to traditional values and beliefs.</p>
    <p>However, we should be cautious about jumping to conclusions and labeling AI as a sign of the end times or the Antichrist. While it is important to be aware of the potential risks and ethical implications of the technology, we should also recognize its potential to do good in the world.</p>
