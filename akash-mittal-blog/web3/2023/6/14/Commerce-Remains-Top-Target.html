    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>It was a typical day for Amy. She decided to buy a new dress online for her friend's wedding. She browsed through various websites, selected a dress, added it to the cart, and proceeded to checkout. However, when she entered her payment details, she noticed something unusual. Her payment was declined, and she received a notification that her account was compromised.</p>
    <p>Amy's story is not unique. Every day, millions of people use online platforms to buy and sell goods and services. E-commerce has become an integral part of our lives, making it easier for us to access products and services from anywhere in the world. However, with this convenience comes a significant risk. Cybercriminals are always looking for vulnerabilities that they can exploit to gain unauthorized access to your personal and financial information.</p>
