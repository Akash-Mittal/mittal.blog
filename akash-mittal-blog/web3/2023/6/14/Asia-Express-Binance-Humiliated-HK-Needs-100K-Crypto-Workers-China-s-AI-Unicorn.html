  <p>Asia's crypto and AI industries are growing at an astonishing pace, with new developments and controversies making headlines every day. Here are some of the latest updates from across the region:</p>
  <h2>The Story of Hong Kong's Need for 100,000 Crypto Workers</h2>
  <p>In recent years, Hong Kong has emerged as one of Asia's top crypto hubs, with a growing number of blockchain projects and digital asset exchanges setting up shop in the city. However, a shortage of skilled workers is posing a major challenge for the industry.</p>
  <p>A recent report by the University of Hong Kong estimated that the city will need 100,000 professionals with expertise in blockchain and other emerging technologies by 2025 in order to meet industry demand. This shortage is not limited to technical roles, but also includes legal, regulatory, and managerial positions.</p>
  <p>Some experts suggest that Hong Kong needs to do more to promote STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) education and attract talent from overseas to fill this skills gap. Others argue that the government and industry should work together to provide training programs and apprenticeships to upskill workers and help them transition into new roles.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Controversies in Asia's Crypto Industry</h2>
  <p>As the crypto industry continues to grow in Asia, it is also facing a number of challenges and controversies. Here are some recent examples:</p>
  <ol>
   <li><strong>AliExpress' NFT Drop Censored:</strong> In March 2022, AliExpress, the popular e-commerce platform owned by China's Alibaba Group, announced that it would be launching a series of NFT drops featuring designs inspired by Chinese culture. However, the first drop was quickly pulled from the platform after some users criticized the designs as culturally insensitive and inappropriate.</li>
   <li><strong>Binance Humiliated on Chinese TV:</strong> In February 2022, Binance, one of the world's largest crypto exchanges, was criticized by Chinese state media for allegedly facilitating illegal activity and evading regulation. The network aired a documentary that accused Binance of providing a platform for money laundering, fraud, and other illicit activities. Binance denied the allegations and called the documentary "misleading and false."</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>The Rise of China's AI Unicorn in 100 Days</h2>
  <p>While the crypto industry in Asia is facing some challenges, the AI industry is booming, especially in China. Recently, a Chinese AI company called Zhongke Zhidong completed a "100-day sprint" to become a unicorn - a startup valued at over $1 billion. Here are some key details:</p>
  <blockquote>
   "Zhongke Zhidong started the sprint in November 2021 with a valuation of just $125 million. By the end of February 2022, it had raised $150 million in a funding round led by Chinese state-owned fund E-towns Capital, bringing its valuation to $1.1 billion. The company specializes in AI software and hardware solutions for industries like healthcare, automotive, and smart cities."
  </blockquote>
  <p>This achievement is a testament to China's growing dominance in the global AI industry, as well as the potential for startups to scale quickly in the country's fast-moving tech ecosystem.</p>
