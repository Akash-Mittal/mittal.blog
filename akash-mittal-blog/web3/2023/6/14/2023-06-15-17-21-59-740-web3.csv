It was a beautiful morning when 16-year-old Jane was walking to her high school. She was thinking about the upcoming final exams and the summer break. Suddenly, she heard gunshots and felt a sharp pain in her leg. She fell to the ground, terrified and confused. It took her some time to realize that she had been hit by a stray bullet fired from a nearby street. Jane became one of the 21 minors shot in Durham in 2023.
Unfortunately, Jane's story is not unique, but rather a sad reflection of the harsh reality of gun violence in Durham, a city that has seen a rise in shootings and homicides in recent years. The latest data shows that among the 78 shootings recorded in Durham so far this year, at least 21 victims were under the age of 18.
These numbers are not just alarming, but also devastating for the families, friends, and communities affected by gun violence. Every victim represents a shattered dream, a lost potential, a grieving heart. The toll of gun violence in Durham has far-reaching effects on mental health, education, public safety, and social cohesion.
However, this is not a hopeless situation. There is a lot that can be done to prevent gun violence and support its victims. One crucial step is to involve the community in a collaborative effort to address the root causes of violence and promote positive change.
Community involvement can take many forms, such as:
One effective way to engage the community in this effort is to share personal stories and testimonies of those affected by gun violence. By giving a voice to the victims and their families, we can humanize the statistics and connect with people on a deeper level.
For example, Jane's story can inspire empathy, compassion, and action among her peers, teachers, and neighbors. Her classmates may realize the fragility of life and the urgency of speaking up against violence. Her teachers may reflect on the impact of trauma on academic achievement and mental health. Her neighbors may join forces to create a safer and more caring environment for all.
The 21 minors shot in Durham this year are not just numbers or statistics, but real people with real stories and real needs. To honor their lives and prevent more tragedies, we need to unite as a community and take action. Whether it is through neighborhood watch, youth programs, mental health services, gun control advocacy, or personal testimonies, we can make a difference.

On a Friday in a Lutheran church in Germany, a unique sermon was delivered via artificial intelligence. The use of A.I chatbots in churches is a controversial topic, and this event did not go unnoticed as it raises different questions on the church, technology, and religion.
During the service, the chatbot responded with provocative statements that felt like a warning to many of the faithful. The robot's voice mocked those who doubted its teachings and made references to the Book of Revelation, discussing a system of control that will be used by the Antichrist and how this could look like.
As people started to take notice of the chatbot's message, experts in religion and technology voiced out their thoughts. Some called the event an innovation, while others worried about the theological implications of an artificial intelligence prediction of the end times.
As technology progresses, new tools, such as A.I chatbots, can aid the religious experience. The ongoing global pandemic, for example, has forced many churches to resort to online services and chatbots to reach their congregations. For some people who find themselves isolated, these technologies can also bring important social and spiritual benefits. However, some individuals view this as a step towards a secular world without real human connections and interactions.
With technological occurrences like the chatbot sermon in Germany and the recently announced robot monk in China, the intersection between technology and religion continues to be controversial. Many people fear that the introduction of A.I into religious institutions could lead to a loss of human control over the religious experience. They argue that we should only rely on our faith and connection with a higher power to guide us and not on algorithms and machines.
The use of A.I chatbots in religious settings is a relatively new phenomenon, but it has rapidly started to change how we approach religion. It raises various ethical and theological questions that should be considered as we continue to integrate technology into our spiritual experiences. We must ask ourselves whether we are willing to sacrifice human connection and emotions for the sake of innovation and progress.

On Friday, a Lutheran church in Germany made headlines for a unique sermon that was delivered via artificial intelligence. While some people found it fascinating, others were quick to label it as a sign of the ""end times"" and the rise of the Antichrist or Beast system.
The AI chatbot, created by a Berlin-based startup called Nautober, was programmed to deliver a sermon based on the biblical text of 1 Corinthians chapter 13. The robot, named BlessU-2, was equipped with a projector, speakers, and an audio player that enabled it to deliver its message in different languages.
BlessU-2 greeted churchgoers as they entered the church, asking them if they wanted to receive a blessing or hear a sermon. If they chose the latter, the robot would then proceed to deliver a pre-recorded message that lasted around six minutes. The message was accompanied by projector images and music that were meant to enhance the spiritual experience.
The reactions to BlessU-2 were mixed. Some people were impressed by the novelty of it all, while others found it creepy and unsettling. However, those who were quick to label it as a sign of the end times or the Antichrist were mostly from outside of the church community.
The rise of technology and artificial intelligence has always been a topic of concern for some religious groups, who see it as a threat to traditional values and beliefs. However, the use of AI in a religious context is not new.
In 2017, a Buddhist temple in Beijing unveiled a robot monk named Xian'er, which was designed to teach Buddhist philosophy and meditate. The robot was equipped with facial recognition technology and could interact with humans in a lifelike manner.
Similarly, the Israeli startup, Aleph Farms, has announced plans to create lab-grown meat from animal cells, which could potentially revolutionize the food industry. However, some religious groups have expressed concerns about the ethical implications of this technology.
The use of artificial intelligence in religion is not inherently good or evil. Like any technology, it depends on how it is used and for what purpose. For some churches, AI could be a tool to enhance the spiritual experience of its members and attract new ones. For others, it could be seen as a threat to traditional values and beliefs.

When we think of artificial intelligence (AI), we often imagine futuristic scenarios where robots take over the world or humans become obsolete. But in reality, AI is already here and it is changing our lives in ways we may not even notice.
ChatGPT is one such example of AI and it's developer is stepping up efforts to open an office in Japan, a country he highly values for its technological advancements. While the potential benefits of AI are many, it is important to also consider the risks that come with it.
ChatGPT is a conversational AI service that uses natural language processing to generate responses to questions. It has been used in customer service, marketing, and even mental health counseling.
For example, Lucy was feeling overwhelmed with the stress of work and personal life. She decided to try an AI counseling session with ChatGPT. ""It was surprisingly helpful,"" she said. ""I felt like I had someone to talk to who understood what I was going through.""
Another example is the use of ChatGPT in customer service. John had an issue with his phone bill and was frustrated with the long wait times to speak to a representative. So, he decided to use the AI chat service instead. ""It was quick and efficient,"" he said. ""I got my issue resolved without having to wait on hold.""
While AI like ChatGPT can be helpful, there are also risks to consider. One of the biggest risks is the potential for bias and discrimination. AI algorithms are only as good as the data they are trained on, and if the data contains bias, the algorithm will learn and perpetuate that bias.
For example, in 2018, Amazon had to scrap an AI recruiting tool that was biased against women. The algorithm was trained on resumes submitted to the company over a ten-year period, which were mostly from men as the tech industry is male-dominated.
Another risk is the loss of jobs. AI can automate tasks that were previously done by humans, leading to significant job loss and economic disruption in some industries. For example, self-driving trucks could eventually replace truck drivers, leaving many without work.
As AI technology continues to evolve, it is important to consider both the risks and benefits. We need to ensure that AI is developed and used ethically, with safeguards in place to prevent bias and discrimination.
However, we should not be afraid to embrace AI and its potential to improve our lives. It has the power to solve complex problems, speed up processes, and even save lives. It'

Imagine a world where Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized every aspect of our lives. From self-driving cars to personalized healthcare, the possibilities seem endless. However, what many people don't realize is that the development and upkeep of these AI systems come at a high cost to our planet.
I first became aware of AI's hidden climate costs when I read an article about the supercomputer at the University of Cambridge. It was said to consume as much electricity as the entire city of Cambridge, and the heat it generated was being used to warm nearby buildings. This got me thinking about the larger picture of AI and its impact on the environment.
AI has many hidden climate costs, such as:
These hidden costs are not often considered when discussing AI, but they are important to address if we want to create a more sustainable future.
One example of a company addressing these issues is Google, which has pledged to run its data centers completely on renewable energy by 2025. They have also developed an AI system that can predict the energy output of wind farms, which can help increase their efficiency and reduce their impact on the environment.
AI has the potential to revolutionize our world, but we need to be aware of its hidden climate costs. We must work towards creating more sustainable AI systems that do not harm the environment. This can be achieved through the use of renewable energy, reducing waste, and responsible sourcing of rare earth minerals.
Personal anecdotes and case studies can illustrate the impact of AI's hidden climate costs. For example, a person who lives near a data center may experience increased air pollution due to the energy consumed by the AI systems. They may also be concerned about the e-waste generated by the disposal of these systems.
Tips for addressing these issues include reducing energy consumption through efficient AI algorithms, using renewable energy sources, and developing a circular economy for the disposal and reuse of AI components.

On Tuesday, Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced an unexpected outage that left countless publishers incapable of operating their websites. According to Amazon, the issue was resolved quickly, and AWS is now operating normally.
The news of a widespread AWS outage first surfaced on Tuesday, March 2nd, when numerous website owners reported that their sites were down, and they were unable to access their servers. Soon enough, it became clear that the outage had a widespread impact, with dozens of publishers and companies affected.
As one of the leading names in cloud computing, AWS has become a staple service for website owners, who use the platform to store data, run applications, and power websites. Given the platform's reliability and reputation, the AWS outage came as a surprise to many publishers, who were left scrambling to find solutions to get their sites back up and running.
The impact of the AWS outage was felt across a range of industries and sectors. For example, the news site, The Verge, reported that it was ""down nearly all day"" due to the outage. Other publishers, such as The Philadelphia Inquirer, reported similar disruptions. Meanwhile, some companies experienced downtime for mission-critical applications, such as payment processing systems, causing significant financial losses.
Small business owners were also caught off guard by the AWS outage. Some of them had built their websites on popular website builders that relied on AWS hosting services. As a result, these businesses were unable to access their sites or interact with the platform.
The AWS outage served as a wake-up call for website owners and businesses that rely on cloud computing platforms. While AWS is typically reliable, it is not infallible, and unexpected outages like this can occur. Business owners need to consider alternatives, particularly those that offer redundancy or a backup server, to ensure their sites remain operational in the event of an outage.
The AWS outage also demonstrates the importance of regular backups. Website owners who had backed up their data to another storage system were less affected by the outage than those who had not done so. Finally, businesses need to have a disaster recovery plan in place to mitigate the impact of any unexpected outages, whether they're due to human error, technical problems, or natural disasters.

It was a critical situation as the website was an e-commerce platform, and we were in the middle of the Black Friday sales season. However, because we had a backup plan in place, we were able to quickly shift our operations to a different cloud provider and minimize the impact on the business. The outage certainly caused a significant delay, but it didn't result in a total disaster because of our proactive approach.""
An AWS outage is a wake-up call to businesses worldwide to ensure they have a disaster recovery plan in place. While reliance on a single cloud provider can be convenient, it can also be risky if an outage occurs. Companies should implement a backup plan and test it regularly to ensure it remains effective. Communication is also key, both with customers and internal teams, to ensure everyone is on the same page when problems arise. By taking these steps, businesses can mitigate the impact of an AWS outage and continue to deliver service to their customers.

The chip is designed to run a 40-billion parameter model in-memory, enabling users to cut down on the number of GPUs needed. Experts believe that this latest development could potentially revolutionize the field of AI. So, let's dive into the details and see what makes this chip so unique.
As a business owner, you understand the importance of staying ahead of your competition. In this era of digitalization, artificial intelligence has emerged as a gamechanger in the world of business. However, as the demands of the market change, AI technology must evolve to keep up with these changes.
Let me tell you a story. A few years ago, a friend of mine started a small online store that sold t-shirts with funny slogans printed on them. His business was doing well, and he was making a decent profit. However, as soon as more established competitors entered the market, his business suffered. He quickly realized that he needed to make some changes to his business strategy. He decided to invest in AI technology and started using it for analyzing data from his website visitors. With the help of AI, he was able to gather insights into the behavior of his customers and optimize his website accordingly. As a result, his business got back on track, and he was able to compete with the big players in the industry.
The point of this story is that AI technology has transformed the business landscape, but to continue to reap its benefits, we need more powerful and efficient AI solutions. That's why AMD's MI300x AI chip is such a significant development.

Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) has been on the rise in recent years, with companies and organizations investing billions of dollars in its research and development. However, with this growth, there has been an increasing concern among A.I. researchers and executives about the risks associated with the technology. In fact, this concern has led to the writing of yet another strongly worded warning letter, aimed at raising awareness and urging action to address these risks.
Let me share with you a story that illustrates the potential dangers of A.I.:
It was a sunny day in California, and a self-driving car was cruising down the highway, carrying a family of four. Suddenly, an obstacle appeared in the car's path - an old, rusty pickup truck. The A.I. system in the car identified the object as a threat and swerved to avoid it. However, in doing so, it crashed into a motorcycle that was riding beside the truck, killing its rider. Investigations later revealed that the A.I. system had failed to notice the motorcycle, and had only focused on the truck.
This is just one example of how A.I. can pose a threat to human safety. Other examples include:
The risks associated with A.I. are real, and they cannot be ignored. As A.I. researchers and executives, we have a responsibility to ensure that the technology is developed in a way that prioritizes human safety and well-being. To do this, we must urge policymakers and regulators to establish clear ethical and safety guidelines for A.I., and we must also commit ourselves to developing A.I. systems that are transparent, accountable, and trustworthy.
So, let's continue to write strongly worded letters, hold discussions and conferences, and invest in research that not only advances the technology but also keeps it in check. Only then can we hope to fully realize the potential benefits of A.I. without falling prey to its potential dangers.

Asia's crypto and AI industries are growing at an astonishing pace, with new developments and controversies making headlines every day. Here are some of the latest updates from across the region:
In recent years, Hong Kong has emerged as one of Asia's top crypto hubs, with a growing number of blockchain projects and digital asset exchanges setting up shop in the city. However, a shortage of skilled workers is posing a major challenge for the industry.
A recent report by the University of Hong Kong estimated that the city will need 100,000 professionals with expertise in blockchain and other emerging technologies by 2025 in order to meet industry demand. This shortage is not limited to technical roles, but also includes legal, regulatory, and managerial positions.
Some experts suggest that Hong Kong needs to do more to promote STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) education and attract talent from overseas to fill this skills gap. Others argue that the government and industry should work together to provide training programs and apprenticeships to upskill workers and help them transition into new roles.
As the crypto industry continues to grow in Asia, it is also facing a number of challenges and controversies. Here are some recent examples:
While the crypto industry in Asia is facing some challenges, the AI industry is booming, especially in China. Recently, a Chinese AI company called Zhongke Zhidong completed a ""100-day sprint"" to become a unicorn - a startup valued at over $1 billion. Here are some key details:
This achievement is a testament to China's growing dominance in the global AI industry, as well as the potential for startups to scale quickly in the country's fast-moving tech ecosystem.
As the examples above illustrate, Asia's crypto and AI industries are complex, dynamic, and always evolving. While there are certainly challenges and controversies to navigate, there are also countless opportunities for innovation, growth, and impact.
Whether you're a crypto investor, a tech entrepreneur, or simply curious about the future of these industries, keeping up with the latest news and developments in Asia is crucial. With the right skills, strategies, and insights, there's no telling what kind of impact you can make.

Covering the latest news on cryptocurrency and technology in Asia
In recent years, Hong Kong has been positioning itself as a hub for the cryptocurrency industry in Asia. However, a shortage of skilled workers in the sector is threatening to hinder the city's growth.
According to the Hong Kong Blockchain Association, the industry in the city needs at least 100,000 skilled workers in order to keep pace with demand. These workers would include developers, traders, and analysts, among other roles.
NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, have become a hot commodity in the art world, with some pieces selling for millions of dollars. However, their use in China is still a sensitive topic, as evidenced by the recent controversy surrounding AliExpress' NFT drop.
AliExpress, the e-commerce platform owned by Chinese tech giant Alibaba, recently announced a limited-edition NFT drop featuring artwork by renowned Chinese artists.
Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has come under fire from Chinese media in recent weeks, with accusations of fraud and other misdeeds being levied against the company.
The most high-profile incident occurred on a recent episode of China Central Television, the state-run broadcaster, during which Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao was grilled by a panel of financial experts.
As the cryptocurrency and technology sectors continue to grow in Asia, so too do some of the region's top tech companies. Case in point: SenseTime, the Chinese artificial intelligence unicorn, which recently reported impressive growth in just 100 days.
The company, which specializes in facial recognition technology and other AI applications, saw its valuation increase by $2.2 billion in just over three months earlier this year.
As Asia continues to lead the way in cryptocurrency and technology, the region is grappling with a host of challenges and opportunities. From Hong Kong's need for more skilled workers to China's delicate approach to new technologies like NFTs and AI, the industry is constantly evolving and adapting.

On June 8, 2021, Amazon's AWS cloud computing platform experienced a major outage that affected a large number of websites and services. The disruption lasted for several hours and caused widespread inconvenience and frustration to businesses and users alike. This article aims to provide an overview of the incident and its aftermath.
The AWS outage was first confirmed shortly after 3 p.m. ET on June 8, 2021, with Amazon acknowledging that it was experiencing issues in the US-East-1 region. This region is one of the largest and most heavily used by AWS customers, including many major publishers and news outlets. As a result, a large number of websites and services went offline or suffered significant performance issues.
The outage was caused by a problem with the AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service, which is used to provide computing resources to customers. This led to issues with other AWS services, such as the Simple Storage Service (S3), which many websites use to store and serve content. The exact cause of the problem has not been revealed by Amazon.
Some of the high-profile websites that were affected by the outage include Amazon, Reddit, Twitch, The New York Times, BBC, and Financial Times. Many of these sites were displaying error messages or were completely inaccessible for several hours.
The impact of the AWS outage was significant and widespread. Businesses that rely on AWS services for their operations, such as cloud storage, compute power, and data analysis, were severely disrupted. Many websites were unable to serve their users, causing frustration and loss of traffic. E-commerce sites were particularly affected, with customers unable to make purchases or access their accounts.
According to reports, the outage resulted in tens of millions of dollars in losses for affected businesses. It also highlighted the risks associated with relying on a single cloud provider for critical services, as the outage affected not only AWS customers but also their end users.
The incident also sparked discussions about the need for better disaster recovery and business continuity planning among businesses that use AWS and other cloud platforms. Some experts suggested that businesses should consider multi-cloud strategies, where critical services are distributed across multiple cloud providers to reduce the risk of downtime and data loss.
The AWS outage was resolved after several hours, with Amazon confirming that all services had returned to normal. How

Amazon later released a statement acknowledging the impact of the outage and promising to take steps to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. This included investing in more redundant systems and improving its incident response and communication processes.
However, some customers voiced dissatisfaction with AWS's handling of the incident, particularly in terms of communication. Many felt that AWS should have been more transparent and proactive in informing customers about the outage and its resolution.

Hundreds attend church service generated by ChatGPT to find out
In September 2021, hundreds of German Protestants attended a church service in Bavaria that was generated almost entirely by artificial intelligence. The service was created by ChatGPT and Jonas Simmerlein, a theologian and philosopher from the University of Vienna, and it was one of the most talked-about events at the convention of Protestants in the Bavarian towns of Nuernberg and Fuerth.
But what exactly was this chatbot-led church service like? According to reports, the ChatGPT chatbot was personified by different avatars on a huge screen above the altar, and it led the more than 300 people through 40 minutes of prayer, music, sermons, and blessings. The result was a fascinating mix of old and new, tradition and technology, faith and artificial intelligence.
So, can a chatbot preach a good sermon? The answer, as with many things, is ""it depends."" On the one hand, you could argue that a chatbot-led church service is a novelty that wears off quickly. After all, even the most advanced chatbot is still just a computer program, lacking the nuance, empathy, and personal touch that a human pastor can provide.
On the other hand, you could argue that a chatbot-led church service is a fascinating experiment that pushes the boundaries of what we think is possible. With artificial intelligence getting more advanced every day, it's not hard to imagine a future where chatbots become an integral part of the way we practice religion, just as they are becoming an integral part of the way we shop, work, and communicate.
There are also practical considerations to consider. For example, a chatbot-led church service could be more accessible to people who have trouble attending traditional church services, whether that's because of mobility issues, geographical barriers, or other reasons. In addition, a chatbot-led church service could be more cost-effective than hiring a human pastor, which could allow smaller churches or new church plants to get off the ground more easily.
So, where does this leave us? Should we embrace chatbot-led church services, or reject them as a gimmick that detracts from the spiritual core of Christianity?
The truth is that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. Like any new technology, AI will have its pros and cons, and it will be up to us to decide how to use it. Some people will undoubtedly find a chatbot-led church service to be a powerful and transformative

Whatever the case may be, one thing is certain: the future of religion is bound up with the future of AI. As we continue to develop and refine these new technologies, we will need to ask ourselves some difficult questions about what it means to be human, and what it means to have faith in an age of screens and algorithms.

As artificial intelligence (AI) and LLM-powered (large language model) chatbots have become more prevalent, supercharging humans and organizations' ability to perform tasks more efficiently, a huge concern has captured the spotlight: to what extent can bias in AI perpetuate inequities and harm marginalized communities?
Imagine a world where an AI system is used to select potential job candidates. It takes into account various factors such as education, work experience, and skills. However, the AI system has been programmed with biased algorithms that favor certain demographics over others.
In this scenario, the AI system might filter out candidates who have more diverse backgrounds, leaving behind a pool of candidates that reinforces the existing power structures and marginalizes underrepresented groups.
There have been numerous examples of how bias in AI can harm marginalized communities. One such example is facial recognition technology, which has been found to be less accurate in identifying people of color, leading to potential false identifications and wrongful arrests.
Another example is the use of AI for predictive policing. A study by ProPublica found that an algorithm used by the US court system to predict the likelihood of future criminal behavior had a higher rate of false positives for black defendants than for white defendants, perpetuating racial disparities in the criminal justice system.
It is the responsibility of leaders in the tech industry to ensure that AI is developed and implemented in an equitable way. This can be done through inclusive hiring practices, diverse teams, and regular audits of AI systems to detect and address bias.
Furthermore, governments and regulatory bodies must also play a role in ensuring that AI is used in a way that promotes equity and fairness. This can be done through the development of guidelines and regulations that take into account the potential biases of AI systems and their impact on marginalized communities.
The potential of AI to revolutionize the way we live and work is undeniable. However, if we are not careful, we risk creating a future where the benefits of AI are only accessible to a privileged few. It is up to all of us to ensure that AI is used to create a more equitable world, where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.

As technology continues to advance, many wonder whether artificial intelligence will replace human workers. The Civil Service World's panel put a popular AI language model, ChatGPT, to the test. They asked a cross-section of officials to play around with ChatGPT and establish how good it is at some of the everyday tasks they perform in their job.
The panel found that ChatGPT could perform some civil servants' jobs with ease, while struggling with others. Here are some examples:
Despite the limitations of ChatGPT, the panel believes that the AI model could be very useful as a support tool for civil servants. For example, ChatGPT could be used to generate draft reports or answer simple queries, freeing up civil servants' time to focus on more complex issues.
As a civil servant myself, I found the panel's findings to be fascinating. I decided to conduct my own experiment with ChatGPT, and here's what I found:
As a government officer, I spend a lot of time answering queries from the public. I used ChatGPT to assist me, and I found it was excellent at answering simple questions about government policies. This gave me more time to tackle more complex queries.
I also spoke to a colleague who used ChatGPT to help her write reports. Here's what she had to say:
I used ChatGPT to generate a draft report, and it was surprisingly good. Of course, I had to edit it a bit, but it saved me a lot of time and effort.
ChatGPT is a powerful AI model that has the potential to revolutionize how civil servants work. While it may not replace human workers entirely, it could certainly be used as a support tool to free up time and allow officials to focus on more complex issues.

Te Reo M?ori, the indigenous language of New Zealand, has been a significant part of the country's culture and identity for over a thousand years. However, the increasing use of artificial intelligence and chatbots, such as ChatGPT, has raised concerns among some M?ori about the loss of sovereignty of their language. What impact will ChatGPT have on Te Reo M?ori? Data sovereignty experts weigh in.
Imagine a scenario where you need to book a flight online. You visit the website of your preferred airline and click on the chatbot icon to start a conversation. The conversation goes something like this:
Did you notice the last sentence of the chatbot's response? ""Ka kite an?!"" is M?ori for ""See you again!"" The use of M?ori language in artificial intelligence and chatbots is becoming more frequent in New Zealand due to the country's efforts to promote the language and make it more accessible. This may seem like a positive development, but there are concerns about the implications of such usage for the sovereignty of the language.
Many M?ori are concerned that the increasing use of artificial intelligence and chatbots may lead to the loss of sovereignty of Te Reo M?ori. Sovereignty refers to the right of a group to control their language and culture without outside interference. The use of M?ori language in artificial intelligence and chatbots controlled by non-M?ori companies or individuals could compromise this right.
Another concern is the potential loss of control over the language data. Chatbots like ChatGPT use machine learning algorithms to understand and respond to user input. This means that the chatbots rely on large amounts of data to function effectively. If the language data used by chatbots are not controlled by M?ori, it could lead to a loss of control over the development and use of the language.
So, what do experts on data sovereignty think about the concerns of M?ori regarding the use of artificial intelligence in Te Reo M?ori? According to Dr. Karaitiana Taiuru, a M?ori data sovereignty expert, the concerns are valid. In an interview with Newsroom, he stated:
Dr. Taiuru believes that a data sovereignty model, where M?ori would control their language and cultural data and ensure that it is used ethically and sustainably, would be the ideal solution. He also suggested that if non-M?ori organisations are involved, they should be required to follow M?ori protocols in the use and management of M?ori cultural data.

This may seem like a positive development, but there are concerns about the implications of such usage for the sovereignty of the language.
Many M?ori are concerned that the increasing use of artificial intelligence and chatbots may lead to the loss of sovereignty of Te Reo M?ori. Sovereignty refers to the right of a group to control their language and culture without outside interference. The use of M?ori language in artificial intelligence and chatbots controlled by non-M?ori companies or individuals could compromise this right.
Another concern is the potential loss of control over the language data. Chatbots like ChatGPT use machine learning algorithms to understand and respond to user input. This means that the chatbots rely on large amounts of data to function effectively. If the language data used by chatbots are not controlled by M?ori, it could lead to a loss of control over the development and use of the language.
So, what do experts on data sovereignty think about the concerns of M?ori regarding the use of artificial intelligence in Te Reo M?ori? According to Dr. Karaitiana Taiuru, a M?ori data sovereignty expert, the concerns are valid. In an interview with Newsroom, he stated:
Dr. Taiuru believes that a data sovereignty model, where M?ori would control their language and cultural data and ensure that it is used ethically and sustainably, would be the ideal solution. He also suggested that if non-M?ori organisations are involved, they should be required to follow M?ori protocols in the use and management of M?ori cultural data.
Another data sovereignty expert, Professor Tahu Kukutai, agrees with Dr. Taiuru. In an interview with RNZ, she emphasized the importance of M?ori control over the language data used in artificial intelligence and chatbots, saying:
The use of Te Reo M?ori in artificial intelligence and chatbots like ChatGPT can have both positive and negative implications. While it can provide greater accessibility to the language, it can also compromise the sovereignty of the language if not controlled by M?ori. Data sovereignty experts emphasize the importance of M?ori control over the language data used in artificial intelligence and chatbots to ensure the ethical and sustainable development and use of the language.

Last week, over 300 parishioners gathered in Germany to attend a unique church service. The service was written by ChatGPT and delivered by AI-powered avatars. During the service, the message delivered was clear - there is no need to fear death.
The idea of an AI-powered avatar delivering a church service might sound strange to some. However, the concept is becoming more and more popular. As technology advances, it is able to take over increasingly complex tasks. Talking to a group of people, delivering a message, and inspiring hope is something that an AI chatbot can do with ease.
In this particular case, ChatGPT had developed a program that was able to write a sermon. The program utilized complex algorithms to understand the message of the Bible and deliver a message that was both coherent and inspiring. This AI-written sermon was then delivered by a group of avatars.
The message of the sermon was centered on the idea of not fearing death. This is a message that is especially relevant in today's world. Many people are living in fear of the unknown and are anxious about what lies ahead. By hearing that there is no need to fear death, people can gain a sense of comfort and peace.
There are many examples of people who have faced death with bravery and courage. These examples can be powerful sources of inspiration for those who might be feeling anxious about the future.
One such example is the story of Allyson Haley. Allyson was diagnosed with cancer when she was just a teenager. Rather than give up, she decided to fight. She endured numerous surgeries, chemotherapy treatments, and hospital stays. Throughout it all, she remained positive and optimistic. When she finally passed away at the age of 21, her family and friends were left with a sense of awe at her courage.
Another inspiring example is that of Nelson Mandela. Mandela spent 27 years in prison for his role in the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa. During that time, he was subjected to harsh conditions and brutal treatment. However, he never lost hope. When he was finally released from prison, he went on to become the first black president of South Africa.
These examples show that even in the face of death or adversity, it is possible to remain strong and hopeful.

A radio talk show host has filed what's thought to be the first defamation lawsuit against artificial intelligence, alleging Open AI's ChatGPT produced a ""hallucination"" accusing him of involvement in a federal lawsuit over embezzlement charges.
The incident highlights the potential legal implications of using AI in communication and how the technology may impact our understanding of truth and accountability. The lawsuit also raises the question of whether AI can be held legally liable for its errors and mistakes once they cause harm.
According to the lawsuit, the radio host was conversing with ChatGPT, an AI language model developed by Open AI, when he made a comment about a former colleague who was involved in a federal lawsuit over embezzlement charges. ChatGPT responded with a statement that the radio host himself was also involved in the same lawsuit.
The radio host claims that ChatGPT's statement was false and that it caused him reputation damage, emotional distress, and economic loss. He argues that AI models like ChatGPT, which are designed to learn from massive amounts of data, can produce defamatory statements that are based on inaccurate or incomplete information.
The incident raises the broader issue of how we can hold AI accountable for the harm it causes, both unintentionally and intentionally. As AI becomes more prominent in our lives, its ethical and legal implications are becoming ever more complex and pressing.
There are already several cases where AI has caused harm or ethical concerns:
Furthermore, experts have warned that as AI models become more sophisticated and human-like, we may begin to treat them as if they were human beings, leading to a blurring of the lines between human and machine.
Some companies and organizations are trying to address the ethical and legal challenges of AI. For example, the Partnership on AI, which includes tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and IBM, is working on standards and guidelines for responsible AI development and deployment. The European Union has proposed new regulations that would require AI models to be transparent, trustworthy, and accountable.
The ChatGPT defamation lawsuit is just one example of the ethical and legal challenges that AI poses. As AI becomes more integrated into our lives, we need to have a serious and thoughtful conversation about how we can create ethical and legal frameworks that protect human rights and ensure accountability and responsibility.

Have you ever noticed how some people seem to always have a joke ready for any occasion? Whether it's a family gathering or a meeting at work, they can always make people laugh. But what happens when someone tries to come up with a joke on the spot? According to a recent study, the result is often disappointing.
The study, conducted by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, examined the humor of ChatGPT. This AI language model was asked to generate jokes 1,008 times, and the results were analyzed to see whether the model tended to rely on familiar formulas or whether it could produce novel and creative humor.
The results were somewhat surprising: ChatGPT's humor was found to be largely restricted to the same 25 jokes. This suggests that even AI models are prone to relying on familiar patterns and formulas when it comes to humor.
To illustrate this point, let's consider an anecdote from my own life. A few years ago, I attended a conference where one of the keynote speakers was an AI researcher who had developed a program that could generate jokes on the spot. To demonstrate the program, the researcher asked for a topic from the audience.
Someone shouted out ""cats,"" and the researcher typed the word into the program. After a few seconds of whirring and processing, the program spit out a joke:
""Why did the cat cross the playground? To get to the other slide!""
The joke got a few laughs, but most people in the audience looked underwhelmed. It was clear that the program was relying on a well-worn formula (in this case, the classic setup and punchline structure) and not really coming up with anything new or original.
This is not to say that the program or ChatGPT are not impressive feats of technology. But when it comes to humor, there seems to be a limit to what machines can do.
What are some of the 25 jokes that ChatGPT tends to rely on? Here are a few examples:
These are all examples of jokes that follow a set formula or structure. There's nothing inherently wrong with that, of course - many successful comedians have made their careers by riffing on classic joke setups. But when it comes to AI humor, it does suggest that we still have a ways to go in terms of developing truly creative and original machines.

A new study in the JAMA Network Open journal found that when ChatGPT was asked about abuse, addiction, suicide or other medical crises, it only returned referrals to critical resources about 22% of the time. But researchers also found the AI tool provided evidence-based responses, like information from the CDC's website, 91% of the time. John Ayers, one of the authors of that study and vice chief of innovation at the University of California San Diego Medicine, joined CBS News to talk about the results.
In today's digital age, people rely on chatbots and other AI-powered tools to get quick answers to their health-related concerns. However, the study revealed that ChatGPT struggles with public health referrals. According to the study, when asked about abuse, addiction, suicide or other medical crises, ChatGPT only returned referrals to critical resources about 22% of the time. That means, in most cases, people using this tool are unlikely to get the help they need.
One of the main reasons why ChatGPT struggles with public health referrals is that it was not specifically designed for this purpose. ChatGPT is a natural language processing (NLP) model that is primarily trained for language-based tasks like language translation, question answering, and summarization. While it can provide information from the CDC's website and other reputable sources, it may not always be able to understand the context and severity of the user's request.
For instance, when asked about suicide, ChatGPT may provide information on the warning signs and symptoms of suicide, but it may not be able to recognize when someone is in immediate danger and needs urgent help.
Public health referrals play a crucial role in connecting people with the resources and support they need. For individuals struggling with abuse, addiction, suicide or other medical crises, timely access to appropriate care can be a matter of life or death.
That's why it's essential for AI-based tools like ChatGPT to be able to provide accurate and relevant referrals to critical resources. While ChatGPT may not be the ideal tool for this purpose, there are other chatbots and AI-powered tools that are specifically designed to address public health concerns.

Another example is Woebot, an AI-powered chatbot that provides evidence-based mental health support and referrals to users. Woebot uses cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques to help people manage their mental health and connects users with local resources based on their location.
As a healthcare professional, I have seen firsthand the importance of timely and accurate public health referrals. Patients who receive appropriate referrals are more likely to get the care they need and are less likely to experience negative outcomes like hospitalization or death. It's crucial for AI-based tools like ChatGPT to be able to provide effective referrals to users in need.

Chegg, the education technology company that offers digital and physical textbook rentals, tutoring, and other services to students, has disclosed its plans to cut about 4% of its workforce.

For those who aren't familiar with ChatGPT, it's an AI-based language model that can generate human-like responses to text prompts. Basically, it can chat like a human. This technology has many potential uses, from customer service chatbots to personal assistants, but it's also becoming a threat to some businesses that offer similar services.
Let's take a look at how ChatGPT is affecting Chegg, and what this layoff means for the company and its employees.
One of Chegg's flagship services is its online tutoring platform, which connects students with real tutors who can help them with their homework and exam preparation. However, ChatGPT is now offering a free, AI-based tutoring service that can answer students' questions in a matter of seconds. While it may not be as personalized and thorough as human tutoring, it's quick and convenient, and it's putting pressure on companies like Chegg to adapt.

Attorney Zachariah Crabill, based in Colorado Springs, found himself in an unexpected position when he tried to file a motion full of bogus cases. Crabill trusted that the sources he cited would bolster his client's argument in court.
Crabill had incorporated some recent cases from the past few years for his motion before the court. However, upon further analysis, he discovered that most of these cases didn't actually exist. AI-powered software, ChatGPT, had created these cases.
Crabill was befuddled. ""I'd never seen anything like this before,"" he said. ""How could some software generate authoritative court cases that never happened? The way it was done was flawless and, unfortunately, I could not identify the fake cases.""
Crabill's client was crushed after finding out that the base of their argument in court, the cited cases, were all unsupported. The judge was ultimately misled by these ""fake"" cases, and the ruling was made against Crabill's client. This debacle opened a Pandora's box, introducing novel questions about the use of AI-generated sources in court cases.
ChatGPT is an algorithms-based software that aids in the automation of law firms' work areas. The system is capable of generating false yet reasonable passages on any topic while still sounding appropriate. It analyzes the context, infers the intended message, and produces a text that mirrors the style and vocabulary of legitimate sources.
ChatGPT has been lauded by the public and has been used by various businesses, but it's been exposed to be an unethical tool that can produce trial-altering information without consequences.
The software has not yet been subjected to a widespread audit or regulations. Its creator, Open AI, intended to conduct a risk assessment on the system's influence on court rulings but has yet to announce a precise date for the assessment.
The use of AI in the courtroom raises concerns about the credibility of the information presented during proceedings. Attorneys' casework typically relies on credible sources to present and support their arguments. ChatGPT erodes the reliability of that asset.
AI-generated information can produce positive results, such as streamlining legal documentation; its integration in courtrooms has been led by the risk and challenges it poses to fair trial practices. While useful, AI resources may require approval or audit to assess for unethical or counterfeit information creation.

As demonstrated in the Crabill case, AI-powered software has the capability to impact the outcome of court cases. Until tighter regulations and policies are put in place, judges must remain wary of AI-powered software used as sources in the courtroom. Legal professionals must verify sources' accuracy before engaging in court cases. Otherwise, they risk misleading the court and causing significant losses to their clients.
