    <h2>A Tale of Two Websites</h2>
    <p>Bob and Alice are two avid online shoppers. Bob likes to browse for discounted gadgets on GadgetMart.com, while Alice prefers to shop for clothes on FashionistaOnline.com.</p>
    <p>One day, Bob noticed that every time he visited GadgetMart.com, he was greeted with recommendations for gadgets that were similar to the ones he had previously viewed or purchased. Meanwhile, Alice noticed that whenever she visited FashionistaOnline.com, the website seemed to know her size and suggested clothes that fit perfectly.</p>
    <p>Both Bob and Alice wondered how these websites knew so much about their preferences, and the answer is simple: HTTP cookies.</p>

    <h2>What are HTTP Cookies?</h2>
    <p>HTTP cookies, also known as web cookies, are small text files that are stored on a user's computer or mobile device when they browse the internet. Cookies allow websites to remember information about the user, such as their login credentials, language preferences, and browsing history.</p>
    <p>There are two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies are temporary cookies that are deleted when the user closes their browser. Persistent cookies, on the other hand, remain on the user's device until they expire or are deleted.</p>
    <p>HTTP cookies are used by websites to improve the user experience by remembering their preferences and personalizing content. For example, if a user adds items to their cart on an e-commerce website but leaves the site without checking out, the website can use cookies to keep track of these items and remind the user about them the next time they visit the site.</p>

    <h2>How Cookies Affect Your Online Experience</h2>
    <p>While HTTP cookies can make your online experience more convenient and personalized, they can also raise concerns about online privacy and security.</p>
    <p>One of the main concerns about cookies is online tracking. Websites can use cookies to track a user's browsing activity across multiple sites, creating a detailed profile of their interests and behavior. This information can be used for targeted advertising, which is why you may see ads for products or services that you have recently searched for or viewed.</p>
    <p>Another concern is third-party cookies, which are cookies that are set by domains other than the one the user is currently visiting. For example, if a user visits GadgetMart.com and a third-party advertising company sets a cookie on their device, that company can track the user's activity even when they are not on GadgetMart.com.</p>
    <p>To address these concerns, many web browsers now offer privacy features that allow users to block third-party cookies or delete cookies after each browsing session. Additionally, websites are required to provide users with clear and concise information about their use of cookies and obtain their consent before setting cookies.</p>
