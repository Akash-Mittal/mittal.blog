   <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <p>Have you ever noticed how some people seem to always have a joke ready for any occasion? Whether it's a family gathering or a meeting at work, they can always make people laugh. But what happens when someone tries to come up with a joke on the spot? According to a recent study, the result is often disappointing.</p>
   <p>The study, conducted by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, examined the humor of ChatGPT. This AI language model was asked to generate jokes 1,008 times, and the results were analyzed to see whether the model tended to rely on familiar formulas or whether it could produce novel and creative humor.</p>
   <p>The results were somewhat surprising: ChatGPT's humor was found to be largely restricted to the same 25 jokes. This suggests that even AI models are prone to relying on familiar patterns and formulas when it comes to humor.</p>

   <h2>Story</h2>
   <p>To illustrate this point, let's consider an anecdote from my own life. A few years ago, I attended a conference where one of the keynote speakers was an AI researcher who had developed a program that could generate jokes on the spot. To demonstrate the program, the researcher asked for a topic from the audience.</p>
   <p>Someone shouted out "cats," and the researcher typed the word into the program. After a few seconds of whirring and processing, the program spit out a joke:</p>
   <p>"Why did the cat cross the playground? To get to the other slide!"</p>
   <p>The joke got a few laughs, but most people in the audience looked underwhelmed. It was clear that the program was relying on a well-worn formula (in this case, the classic setup and punchline structure) and not really coming up with anything new or original.</p>
   <p>This is not to say that the program or ChatGPT are not impressive feats of technology. But when it comes to humor, there seems to be a limit to what machines can do.</p>

   <h2>Examples</h2>
   <p>What are some of the 25 jokes that ChatGPT tends to rely on? Here are a few examples:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>"Why did the chicken cross the road?"</li>
    <li>"Knock knock, who's there?"</li>
    <li>"Why was the math book sad?"</li>
    <li>"What do you call cheese that isn't yours?"</li>
    <li>"Why did the tomato turn red?"</li>
   </ul>
   <p>These are all examples of jokes that follow a set formula or structure. There's nothing inherently wrong with that, of course - many successful comedians have made their careers by riffing on classic joke setups. But when it comes to AI humor, it does suggest that we still have a ways to go in terms of developing truly creative and original machines.</p>

   <h2>Conclusions</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>AI humor is still very limited.</li>
    <li>The limitations of AI humor suggest that there is still a lot of room for creative and original comedy that is not formulaic.</li>
    <li>As AI technology continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how machines can be trained to think more creatively and come up with truly original jokes and humorous observations.</li>
