    <p>Advanced Micro Devices Inc on Tuesday gave new details about an artificial intelligence chip that will challenge market leader Nvidia Corp, but the company left out what Wall Street wanted to know - who plans to buy it.</p>
    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>AMD is looking to up the ante in the world of artificial intelligence and machine learning with its latest AI chip. The company is targeting the $21 billion AI market dominated by Nvidia. The new chip, called the Instinct MI200, is designed for use in data centers, where AI processing tasks are performed. It offers up to 1.5 terabytes per second of memory bandwidth and more than 10 petaflops of FP64 performance. The chip is also capable of 8-bit integer operations at a speed of 460 teraops per second.</p>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>The demand for AI chips is growing rapidly as more companies use artificial intelligence to improve their products and services. Nvidia has been the leader in this market with its GPUs being used in many of the world's largest data centers. However, AMD is not backing down and has made significant progress with the Instinct MI200 AI chip. The company has partnered with Hewlett Packard Enterprise and the US Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory to test the chip in various applications.</p>
    <p>According to a report by IDC, the AI chip market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 56.1% from 2020 to 2025. This presents a huge opportunity for companies like AMD and Nvidia to capture a significant share of the market.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>AMD's latest AI chip is a step in the right direction for the company to compete with Nvidia in the AI market. The chip's impressive performance capabilities make it an attractive option for data centers and companies looking to improve their AI processing capabilities. However, the lack of clarity on who plans to buy the chip makes the uphill battle against Nvidia even tougher for AMD. Only time will tell if AMD's Instinct MI200 can truly compete with Nvidia's dominance in the AI market.</p>
