   <p>The film industry is constantly changing, and even more so during the ongoing writers strike. In a major calendar shake up, Disney has announced some big changes to release dates for many of its upcoming movies.</p>
   <h2>Deadpool 3</h2>
   <p>Perhaps the biggest news is that Deadpool 3 has been moved up in the schedule and is now set to release on May 27, 2022 - a full year earlier than previously announced. Fans of the irreverent superhero have been eagerly anticipating the next installment since the release of Deadpool 2 in 2018.</p>
   <p>With Ryan Reynolds reprising his role as Deadpool, this sequel is expected to be just as witty and action-packed as its predecessors. However, with a new director at the helm and the current state of the film industry, it remains to be seen how the movie will turn out.</p>
   <h2>Avatar Sequels</h2>
   <p>On the other hand, the much-anticipated sequels to James Cameron's ground-breaking movie Avatar have been delayed yet again. Originally set to release in 2014, fans have been waiting patiently for the next installment for almost a decade.</p>
   <p>According to Disney, Avatar 2 will now release on December 16, 2022, with Avatar 3 pushed back to December 20, 2024, Avatar 4 to December 18, 2026, and Avatar 5 to December 22, 2028. While this news may be disappointing to fans, it does give the filmmakers more time to perfect their vision and create a truly stunning sequel.</p>
   <h2>Other Movies</h2>
   <p>Disney has also announced several other changes to its upcoming movie schedule. Blade, starring Mahershala Ali, has been moved to July 7, 2023. Meanwhile, the next Star Wars movie has been delayed to December 2023, and Thor: Love and Thunder has been pushed to February 2024.</p>
   <p>Given the current state of the film industry and the ongoing writers strike, it's no surprise that release dates are constantly shifting. However, Disney's latest calendar shake up is sure to have a big impact on moviegoers and fans alike.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
