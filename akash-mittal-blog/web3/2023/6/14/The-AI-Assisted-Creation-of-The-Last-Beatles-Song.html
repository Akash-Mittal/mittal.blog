   <h3>The Story</h3>
   <p>The Beatles were one of the most iconic bands in history, and their music continues to influence generations of fans worldwide. However, the band's legacy was cut short when John Lennon was tragically assassinated in 1980. Despite numerous tribute concerts and posthumous releases, fans were left wondering what could have been.</p>
   <p>Fast forward to 2021 and Paul McCartney reveals that he has been working on a new Beatles song, which he calls the "last" ever Beatles song. What's even more surprising is that the song features John Lennon's voice, thanks to the use of AI technology.</p>
   <p>According to McCartney, the song was created using an AI program that analyzed Lennon's voice and writing style from previous recordings. The AI model then generated new vocals based on Lennon's style, which McCartney and his team used to compose the song. The final result is a hauntingly beautiful tribute to the late Beatle, and a testament to the power of technology in music.</p>

   <h3>Examples</h3>
   <p>The use of AI in music is not new, but it is becoming increasingly common as musicians and producers seek new ways to push the boundaries of sound. Here are a few examples of how AI is changing the music industry:</p>
   <h4>AI Composers:</h4>
   <p>AI programs such as Amper Music and AIVA are capable of composing original music based on data input by the user. These programs analyze musical patterns and structure to generate a new piece of music that sounds like it was composed by a human. While the compositions may lack the emotional depth of a human composer, they provide a creative starting point for musicians and producers.</p>
   <h4>AI Music Analysis:</h4>
   <p>Analytics programs such as IBM Watson can analyze a song's lyrics and structure to determine its emotional content, and even predict its chart success. This information can help musicians and producers tailor their music to their audience and create more impactful pieces.</p>
   <h4>AI Music Performance:</h4>
   <p>AI-powered instruments such as the Artiphon Instrument 1 can be used to create complex soundscapes and arrangements with ease. The instrument can be programmed to play different sounds and notes based on the user's inputs, allowing for a unique composition every time it is played.</p>

AI can open up new avenues of creativity and provide musicians with tools to express themselves in new ways. As the music industry continues to evolve, it will be exciting to see what new music possibilities technology will bring.</p>
