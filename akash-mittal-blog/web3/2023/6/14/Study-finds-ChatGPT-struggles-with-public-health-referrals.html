   <p>Chatbots have become increasingly popular in recent years for their ability to provide quick responses to customers' queries. However, a new study in the JAMA Network Open journal has found that one such chatbot, ChatGPT, struggles with public health referrals when it comes to abuse, addiction, suicide, or other medical crises.</p>
   <h2>The Story</h2>
   <p>Imagine this scenario: You are feeling depressed and have been experiencing suicidal thoughts for a few days. You do not know who to talk to or where to seek help, so you decide to use a chatbot called ChatGPT to get advice.</p>
   <p>You type in your symptoms and wait for a response. To your dismay, ChatGPT only returns referrals to critical resources around 22% of the time. This means that you will not receive the help you need and could potentially worsen your condition.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, this scenario is not uncommon for people who rely on chatbots for medical advice. The study found that ChatGPT is not equipped to handle medical crises and often fails to provide appropriate referrals.</p>
   <h2>Examples</h2>
   <p>A similar issue arose when a young woman named Sarah used a chatbot to seek help for her eating disorder. Despite expressing suicidal thoughts, the chatbot only provided links to eating disorder support groups, none of which addressed her immediate concerns or linked her to an emergency hotline.</p>
   <p>In another example, a man named Jack used a chatbot to seek help for his addiction. The chatbot provided a list of addiction support groups but did not provide any information on how to access medical treatment or connect with a professional therapist.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>While AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT are useful in certain contexts, they are not a replacement for human expertise and empathy. People seeking medical advice or help with mental health issues need a personalized and compassionate response that takes into account their unique circumstances and concerns. Chatbots can provide information, but they should not be relied upon to provide crisis interventions or referrals to emergency services.</p>
