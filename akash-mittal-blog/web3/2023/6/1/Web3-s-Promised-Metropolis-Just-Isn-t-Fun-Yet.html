    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>It was supposed to be the next big thing. The move from Web2 to Web3 was hailed as the dawn of a new era. But despite the hype, Web3's promised metropolis just isn't fun yet. This article takes a closer look at the current state of Web3 and why it fails to live up to its promises.</p>
    <h2>Anecdote</h2>
    <p>When I first heard about Web3, I was excited. The idea of a decentralized web that puts users in control of their data and removes the need for middlemen sounded like a no-brainer.</p>
    <p>But my excitement quickly turned to disappointment when I tried to use some of the dApps that are supposed to represent the future of Web3. The user experience was clunky, slow, and frustrating. The promise of decentralization was there, but at what cost?</p>
    
    <p>According to DappRadar, the most popular dApps on the Ethereum blockchain are still dominated by gambling apps and decentralized exchanges. These might be interesting use cases, but they hardly represent the transformative potential of Web3. And even these "popular" dApps only have a few thousand daily active users.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, the cost of using some of these dApps has skyrocketed due to Ethereum's congestion and high gas fees. Users are being priced out of the network, and there's little incentive for developers to create new dApps when there's such a limited userbase.</p>

    <p>Web3's Promised Metropolis: Why it's Not Fun Yet</p>
    
    <p>I recently tried to use a decentralized social network that promised to put users in control of their data. The registration process was long and complicated, and I had to manually add my Ethereum wallet address to my profile. My feed was filled with spam and low-quality content. And when I tried to use some of the dApps that were integrated with the social network, I had to pay exorbitant gas fees just to send a few dollars worth of tokens to a friend. It was a frustrating and disappointing experience.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>Web3 has a long way to go before it can deliver on its promises.</li>
     <li>The user experience of most Web3 dApps is poor and needs significant improvement.</li>
     <li>High gas fees and network congestion are serious barriers to entry for both users and developers.</li>
    </ol>
