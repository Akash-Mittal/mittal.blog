   <p>Once upon a time, a father was helping his daughter with her math homework. He was struggling to explain a concept, so he turned to his phone for assistance. He downloaded an app called ChatGPT, a conversational AI program that can answer any question. He asked the app to explain the concept to his daughter, and in a matter of seconds, the app had generated a clear and concise explanation that both the father and daughter could understand.</p>
   <p>This scenario is becoming more and more common as AI technology continues to advance. And while it can be incredibly helpful, it's also important for parents to understand the potential risks and limitations of these technologies.</p>
   
   <p>ChatGPT is just one example of the burgeoning AI technology that's becoming increasingly accessible to the general public. Other examples include voice-activated assistants like Siri and Alexa, automated financial advisors like Betterment, and self-driving cars from companies like Tesla.</p>
   <p>These types of technologies can be incredibly helpful in certain situations. For example, a voice-activated assistant can help someone with physical disabilities to control their home environment. An automated financial advisor can help someone who's intimidated by the complexities of investing. And a self-driving car can help reduce the number of accidents caused by human error.</p>
   <p>However, it's important to understand that these technologies are not perfect. For example, self-driving cars have been involved in accidents, and there's still a lot of debate around who's responsible when these accidents occur. There are also concerns around the safety and security of voice-activated assistants, which have been known to accidentally record private conversations.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>AI technology is becoming increasingly accessible to the general public and can be incredibly helpful in certain situations.</li>
    <li>However, it's important for parents to understand the potential risks and limitations of these technologies.</li>
    <li>Parents should also be aware of how their children are using these technologies and set appropriate boundaries and guidelines.</li>
   </ol>
   
   <p>One mother, for example, noticed that her teenage daughter was spending hours each day interacting with a chatbot. The chatbot was designed to provide emotional support, and her daughter had become quite attached to it. However, the mother began to worry that her daughter was becoming too dependent on the chatbot and was using it as a substitute for real human interaction.</p>
   <p>The mother decided to set some boundaries around her daughter's use of the chatbot. She encouraged her daughter to spend more time interacting with real people and to develop a support system of friends and family members. She also monitored her daughter's use of the chatbot and made sure that it wasn't becoming an unhealthy obsession.</p>
   <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Set boundaries around your child's use of AI technology, particularly chatbots and other conversational agents.</li>
    <li>Encourage your child to spend time interacting with real people and developing a support system of their own.</li>
    <li>Monitor your child's use of technology and make sure that it's not becoming an unhealthy addiction or obsession.</li>
   </ul>
