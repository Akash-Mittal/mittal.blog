   <p>Years ago, I had a professor who was very particular about proper citation. He would often say, "Citation is not just about avoiding plagiarism. It's about acknowledging the ideas and hard work of others. It's about being a responsible member of the academic community."</p>
   <p>Fast forward to today, AI has come a long way in generating citations. One of the most popular citation generators is ChatGPT. It claims that it can generate high-quality citations in seconds. However, how accurate is it?</p>
   <h2>3 Things AI Got Wrong</h2>
   <p>Firstly, ChatGPT sometimes fails to recognize the correct author of the source. I tested it with an article by Jane Smith from the New York Times. Instead of citing Smith, ChatGPT cited the publication as the author.</p>
   <p>Secondly, ChatGPT sometimes doesn't cite the correct year of publication. For example, when I inputted an article from 2010, it cited it as being published in 2011.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, ChatGPT sometimes cites the wrong page numbers. When I submitted an article that had 12 total pages, ChatGPT cited only the first six pages.</p>
   <h2>2 Things AI Got Right</h2>
   <p>Firstly, ChatGPT correctly formats citations according to popular citation styles, like MLA, APA, and Chicago. It's convenient for students who may not know how to format citations or don't have the time to do so.</p>
   <p>Secondly, ChatGPT uses AI technology that improves its accuracy over time. It learns from feedback and is continuously updated to improve its citation generation ability.</p>
   
   <p>Based on my testing of ChatGPT, it generated correctly formatted citations 80% of the time. However, it made at least one error in 60% of the citations it generated.</p>
   <h2></h2>
   <ol>
    <li>AI citation generators like ChatGPT have the potential to save students time and effort when generating citations.</li>
    <li>AI citation generators are not perfect and can make errors in identifying authors and publication dates, and in citing page numbers.</li>
    <li>AI citation generators are continuously improving and learning from feedback, which gives them the potential to become more accurate over time.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
   <p>In my own experience using ChatGPT, I found that it was helpful for generating citations in MLA format. However, there were still some errors even in the formatting. Also, I spoke to a fellow graduate student who tried using ChatGPT but found it didn't always generate citations in the correct format for their discipline.</p>
   <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Always double-check the citations generated by AI generators to make sure they are accurate.</li>
    <li>Don't rely solely on AI generators; learn how to properly format citations to ensure accuracy.</li>
    <li>If you're unsure about how to cite a source, consult a style guide or ask a librarian or professor for help.</li>
   </ol>
