    <h2>The Story of a Young Girl Named Emily</h2>
    <p>Emily was a talented musician and an honor roll student. However, she started to develop body image issues at the age of 13. By the time she turned 15, she started to engage in restrictive eating behavior. She felt guilty every time she ate even a small portion of food. She lost a lot of weight and was constantly fatigued. Her parents became increasingly concerned about her physical and mental well-being. They visited their family doctor, but Emily denied any issues related to eating habits. One day, her mother came across an AI chatbot for National Eating Disorder Association. This was a turning point for Emily and her family, as they finally received the support they needed.</p>
