     <h2>The Story</h2> C3.ai, a leading provider of AI software and solutions, recently announced its Q1 earnings report. Despite beating expectations with a revenue of $83.2 million, which was a 29% increase from the previous year, shares plunged more than 12%. This unexpected drop in stocks had many investors questioning the company's future prospects. <br><br>
      C3.ai had experienced tremendous growth in the past year as the COVID-19 pandemic led to a surge in demand for AI and data analytics. The company had formed partnerships with major players in industries such as healthcare, energy, and aerospace, and seemed to be in an ideal position to capitalize on the growing AI market. However, the Q1 report seemed to suggest a slowdown in this growth, leading to the stocks collapse.
