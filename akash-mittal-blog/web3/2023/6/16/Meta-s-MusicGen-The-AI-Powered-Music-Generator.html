    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>Music has always been a powerful medium of self-expression. People use music to celebrate, to mourn, to protest, and to heal. With the advances in technology, it has become easier to create music even for those who do not have professional training. Recently, I came across Meta's MusicGen, an AI-powered music generator that can turn a text description into about 12 seconds of audio. I was intrigued to know more about this tool, its capabilities, and its potential impact on the music industry, so I decided to delve deeper.</p>

    <p>Meta's MusicGen is a fascinating tool that can cater to a wide range of musical genres and moods. Here are some examples:</p>
    <ul>
     <li><strong>Relaxing:</strong> Description - "The sound of waves crashing on the shore." MusicGen generates a serene melody with the sound of waves in the background.</li>
     <li><strong>Upbeat:</strong> Description - "A sunny day in the park with friends." MusicGen creates an energetic beat with cheerful sounds of laughter and clapping.</li>
     <li><strong>Sad:</strong> Description - "Losing someone you love." MusicGen produces a melancholic tune with somber piano chords and strings.</li>

    <p>What's impressive about MusicGen is that it can create music from any text description, even unconventional ones. For example, you can ask MusicGen to generate music for "a cat chasing a mouse" or "an alien invasion," and it will create something unique and evocative.</p>
