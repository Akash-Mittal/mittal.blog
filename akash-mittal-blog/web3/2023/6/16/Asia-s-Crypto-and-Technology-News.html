   <h2>Hong Kong Needs 100,000 Crypto Workers Stat</h2>
   <p>In recent years, Hong Kong has been positioning itself as a hub for the cryptocurrency industry in Asia. However, a shortage of skilled workers in the sector is threatening to hinder the city's growth.</p><img src="hong-kong-crypto.jpg" alt="Hong Kong skyline with cryptocurrency symbols overlay">
   <p>According to the Hong Kong Blockchain Association, the industry in the city needs at least 100,000 skilled workers in order to keep pace with demand. These workers would include developers, traders, and analysts, among other roles.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The shortage of skilled workers is largely due to the fact that the cryptocurrency industry is still in its nascent stages in Hong Kong, with few local educational institutions offering relevant courses or degrees.</li>
    <li>The lack of clear regulatory guidelines from the Hong Kong government has also prevented many top-tier talent from entering the industry.</li>
    <li>Despite these challenges, the industry is still growing rapidly, with more and more companies launching in Hong Kong and the wider Asia region.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>AliExpress' NFT Drop Censored</h2>
   <p>NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, have become a hot commodity in the art world, with some pieces selling for millions of dollars. However, their use in China is still a sensitive topic, as evidenced by the recent controversy surrounding AliExpress' NFT drop.</p><img src="aliexpress-nft.jpg" alt="Screenshot of AliExpress NFT listing">
   <p>AliExpress, the e-commerce platform owned by Chinese tech giant Alibaba, recently announced a limited-edition NFT drop featuring artwork by renowned Chinese artists.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>However, the drop was quickly censored by Chinese authorities, who cited concerns over potential copyright infringement and money laundering.</li>
    <li>Some critics have argued that the censorship was motivated by a desire to maintain control over the emerging NFT market in China.</li>
    <li>Despite the setback, many industry experts believe that NFTs will continue to gain traction in China, especially as more artists and creators look to monetize their work in the digital age.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Binance Humiliated on China TV</h2>
   <p>Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has come under fire from Chinese media in recent weeks, with accusations of fraud and other misdeeds being levied against the company.</p><img src="binance-tv.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao on China TV">
   <p>The most high-profile incident occurred on a recent episode of China Central Television, the state-run broadcaster, during which Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao was grilled by a panel of financial experts.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The experts accused Binance of facilitating illegal transactions and failing to properly regulate its platform, among other accusations.</li>
    <li>Zhao, for his part, denied the allegations and defended Binance's track record.</li>
    <li>Despite the negative press, Binance has continued to operate in China and other markets around the world, though the scrutiny has led some users to rethink their relationship with the exchange.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>AI Unicorn Grows in 100 Days</h2>
   <p>As the cryptocurrency and technology sectors continue to grow in Asia, so too do some of the region's top tech companies. Case in point: SenseTime, the Chinese artificial intelligence unicorn, which recently reported impressive growth in just 100 days.</p><img src="sensetime.jpg" alt="SenseTime logo">
   <p>The company, which specializes in facial recognition technology and other AI applications, saw its valuation increase by $2.2 billion in just over three months earlier this year.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The growth was largely due to increased demand for SenseTime's products and services in China and abroad.</li>
    <li>The company has partnerships with a number of other tech giants, including Alibaba and Qualcomm, which are helping to fuel its expansion.</li>
    <li>Some industry watchers have raised concerns over the use of facial recognition technology in China, where it has been used by the government to monitor citizens and suppress dissent. However, SenseTime has maintained that its technology is intended for commercial, rather than political, purposes.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>As Asia continues to lead the way in cryptocurrency and technology, the region is grappling with a host of challenges and opportunities. From Hong Kong's need for more skilled workers to China's delicate approach to new technologies like NFTs and AI, the industry is constantly evolving and adapting.</p>
   <p>At the same time, entrepreneurs and investors are recognizing the immense potential for growth and innovation in the sector, with new players continuing to enter the market and push boundaries.</p>
