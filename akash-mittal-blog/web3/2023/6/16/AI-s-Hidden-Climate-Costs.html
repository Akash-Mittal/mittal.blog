  <p>It was a hot summer day in New York City when Sarah decided to take a walk in Central Park. As she walked, she noticed a small delivery robot rolling down the street, making deliveries for a nearby restaurant. It was fascinating to watch the robot navigate the busy sidewalks and cross streets on its own. However, the more she thought about it, the more she realized the environmental impact of these machines. That's when she started to research AI and climate change.</p>
  <h2>The Environmental Impact of AI</h2>
  <p>Artificial intelligence is being used more and more in our everyday lives to make things easier, faster, and more efficient. However, what many people don't realize is that AI has a hidden cost when it comes to the environment. For example, the energy consumption of AI algorithms is increasing exponentially. More and more data centers are being built to store and process the massive amounts of data generated by AI.</p>
  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p>One example of this is the Google Data Center in Georgia, which consumes as much electricity as a small city. Another example is the use of AI in transportation, such as self-driving cars, drones, and delivery robots. These machines require a significant amount of energy to run, and their production contributes to the carbon footprint of the manufacturing industry.</p>
  <p>On top of this, the rise of AI is leading to an increase in e-waste. When machines are no longer useful or break down, they are usually discarded, often ending up in landfills and contributing to pollution. A report by the UN found that the world produces around 50 million tons of e-waste each year.</p>
  <h2>The Solution</h2>
  <p>Despite the negative impact of AI on the environment, there are steps we can take to mitigate these effects. One solution is to focus on renewable energy sources, like solar and wind power, to power the data centers that run AI algorithms. Additionally, companies using AI should factor in the environmental impact of their machines and work towards reducing their carbon footprint.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion: 3 Points to Consider</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>AI algorithms consume a significant amount of energy and contribute to carbon emissions, leading to negative impacts on the environment.</li>
   <li>Using renewable energy sources to power data centers and considering the environmental impact of AI machines can help mitigate their effects on the environment.</li>
   <li>As AI becomes more integrated into our daily lives, it's essential to consider its impact on the environment and take steps to reduce its carbon footprint.</li>
