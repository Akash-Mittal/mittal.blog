    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>It's 6 pm on a typical weekday, and Sarah, an HR manager at a top tech firm in San Francisco, is struggling to keep up with her workload. She has to review hundreds of resumes from applicants who have applied for the company's latest IT position. Sarah is already aware of a new trend where employers are demanding that employees possess ChatGPT skills. She is convinced that this new requirement will take the company to greater heights, but her traditional mindset is making it hard for her to find the right candidates.</p>
    <p>Finally, Sarah happens upon a candidate with a degree in computer science and ChatGPT experience. Even though the applicant has no work experience, Sarah is confident that she can mold the candidate because of their ChatGPT skills and hires them. Within a few weeks of hiring this new employee, the company's productivity has increased exponentially, allowing them to stay ahead of the competition.</p>
