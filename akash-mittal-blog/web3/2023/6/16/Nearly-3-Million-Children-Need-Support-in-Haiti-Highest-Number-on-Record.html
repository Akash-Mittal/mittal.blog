   <p>It was a warm afternoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, when Aniëlle, a 12-year-old girl, was playing with her friends in the streets. Suddenly, they heard a loud noise and saw a cloud of dust approaching. An earthquake had hit the island, killing thousands of people and leaving many others homeless, injured, and traumatized.</p>
   <p>Aniëlle's house was destroyed, and she had to live with her grandparents in a small room without electricity or running water. Her mother had died in the earthquake, and her father was working in the Dominican Republic to send money for the family's survival.</p>
   <p>But Aniëlle was lucky compared to many other Haitian children. She was able to go to school and receive emotional support from a local charity that provided counseling and art therapy sessions. However, not all children in Haiti have access to such services.</p>
   <h2>The Dire Situation of Haitian Children</h2>
   <p>According to the latest data, there are nearly 3 million children in Haiti who need support – the highest number on record. The factors contributing to this dire situation are numerous:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Poverty:</strong> More than 80% of Haitians live below the poverty line, and many families struggle to provide for their children's basic needs, such as food, shelter, and healthcare.</li>
    <li><strong>Natural disasters:</strong> Haiti is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, with frequent hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes. These disasters not only cause physical damage but also disrupt children's education, social relationships, and mental health.</li>
    <li><strong>Violence:</strong> Haiti has high rates of violence, including domestic violence, gang violence, and sexual violence. Children are often the victims of such violence or witness it in their communities, causing long-term trauma and insecurity.</li>
    <li><strong>Diseases:</strong> Haiti has one of the highest rates of child mortality in the Americas, with many children dying from preventable diseases such as diarrhea, pneumonia, and malaria. Lack of access to clean water, sanitation facilities, and medical care are major contributors to this problem.</li>
    <li><strong>Education:</strong> Haiti has one of the lowest literacy rates in the world, with almost half of the population unable to read or write. Many children do not have access to quality education, especially in rural areas, where schools are often under-resourced and poorly staffed.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Examples of Child Support and Protection Services in Haiti</h2>
   <p>Despite the challenging context, there are organizations and individuals working to improve the lives of Haitian children. Here are some examples:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Save the Children:</strong> This international organization has been working in Haiti since 1978 to support children's rights and nutrition. Its programs include early childhood development, health and hygiene, and child protection.</li>
    <li><strong>Fonkoze:</strong> This Haitian-led microfinance institution provides loans and financial training to women and families, empowering them to start their own businesses and improve their incomes. This, in turn, can support children's education and well-being.</li>
    <li><strong>Zanmi Lasante:</strong> This health organization operates several clinics and hospitals in Haiti, providing medical care to children and families. It also runs community health programs, such as clean water initiatives and malnutrition prevention.</li>
    <li><strong>Zanmi Timoun:</strong> This local NGO aims to protect children's rights and prevent abuse, neglect, and exploitation. Its programs include education and awareness-raising for parents and communities, as well as direct support to vulnerable children.</li>
    <li><strong>Art therapy sessions:</strong> As mentioned earlier, some organizations provide art therapy sessions to help children express their emotions and cope with trauma. These sessions can also promote creativity, self-confidence, and social skills.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In summary, the situation of Haitian children is dire, with nearly 3 million of them in need of support. However, there are organizations and individuals working to provide them with essential services such as education, health care, protection, and emotional support.</p>
   <p>Here are three key points to remember:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Poverty, natural disasters, violence, diseases, and lack of education are among the main challenges facing Haitian children.</li>
    <li>Save the Children, Fonkoze, Zanmi Lasante, Zanmi Timoun, and art therapy sessions are examples of child support and protection services in Haiti.</li>
    <li>We can all make a difference by donating to reputable organizations, volunteering our time and skills, or spreading awareness about the situation of Haitian children.</li>
