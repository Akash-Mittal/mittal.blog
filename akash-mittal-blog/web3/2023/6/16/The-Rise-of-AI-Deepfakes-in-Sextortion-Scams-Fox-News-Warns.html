   <h2>The Story</h2>
   <p>The FBI recently issued a warning about the use of artificial intelligence-generated deepfakes in sextortion scams. Since April, there has been a noticeable uptick in victims reporting these types of scams.</p>
   <p>Deepfakes are videos or images that have been manipulated using advanced software to replace one person's face with another. In the case of sextortion scams, these deepfakes often involve innocent individuals, such as celebrities or ordinary people, being depicted in compromising sexual positions or engaging in explicit acts.</p>
   <h2>Examples</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>A teenage girl receives a message on social media from someone claiming to be a boy her age. After chatting for a while and exchanging photos, the girl receives a video of herself engaging in sexual activity. The video seems convincing, but it has been created using an AI deepfake. The perpetrator now threatens to share the video with the girl's family and friends unless she pays up.</li>
    <li>A businessman receives an email that appears to be from a well-known journalist. The email contains a link to a video that supposedly shows the journalist engaging in sexual activity. The businessman clicks on the link and sees what appears to be a convincing video, but it too has been created using an AI deepfake. The email demands that the businessman pay a certain amount of money or risk having the video shared publicly.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Be wary of unsolicited messages:</strong> If you receive a message from someone you don't know, especially if they're asking for personal information or photos, be cautious.</li>
    <li><strong>Protect your online identity:</strong> Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication to prevent hackers from accessing your accounts.</li>
    <li><strong>Report suspicious activity:</strong> If you believe you have been the victim of a sextortion scam or have received a suspicious message, report it to the authorities right away.</li>
   </ul>
