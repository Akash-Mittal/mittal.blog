  <p></p>
  <p>As the world battles the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to kill bacteria has gained significant attention. However, according to experts, this AI is also being used to bust unions and monitor the productivity of employees. Let's explore this dual role of AI and its impact on society.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The Story</p>
  <p>David, a factory worker, noticed that his employer installed cameras equipped with AI to monitor their productivity. The AI could detect when they were not working or taking breaks, and this resulted in pay deductions. David, along with his colleagues, complained to the union, but their efforts were in vain. The company, backed by the government, used the AI technology to bust the union and intimidate its workers.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Examples</p>
  <p>The use of AI to monitor employees' productivity is not new. Companies worldwide are adopting this technology to increase efficiency and cut costs. However, research shows that this initiative leads to a reduction in job satisfaction, increased stress, and burnout among employees. Furthermore, the use of AI-based systems to bust unions is gaining momentum in countries like China, where the government is authoritarian and has little tolerance for dissent.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion</p>
  <p>The use of AI to kill bacteria is a welcome development amid the COVID-19 pandemic. However, its use to bust unions and monitor employees' productivity is a worrisome trend that needs serious attention. The use of AI should not be a tool for exploitation but must serve a broader purpose of benefiting society as a whole.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Points to Remember:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. The use of AI to increase productivity is a double-edged sword that leads to reduced job satisfaction and increased stress among employees.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. The Communist government of China is engaging in using AI technology to bust unions and intimidate its workers.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. The use of AI must serve a broader purpose of benefiting society as a whole and not be used as an exploitative tool.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>:</p>
  <p>My cousin, who worked in a garment factory in Bangladesh, was forced to work in inhumane conditions resulting in severe mental health problems. When the workers requested the installation of cameras that could monitor the factory's environment, their request was denied, and they were threatened with job loss.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Tips:</p>
  <p>1. Unions should educate their members about the use of AI and its potential impacts on their jobs and mental health.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Governments must introduce policies that regulate the use of AI-based systems in the workplace.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Companies must prioritize the well-being of their employees and not solely focus on profits.</p>
