   <h2>Story</h2>
   <p>The United Kingdom has been granted a unique opportunity to preview and shape the future of artificial intelligence. Tech giants Google DeepMind, OpenAI and Anthropic have offered the U.K. early or priority access to new AI models that they are developing. This is a significant development as it offers the U.K. a chance to be at the forefront of new breakthroughs in AI and to guide the development of this technology in a responsible and ethical way.</p>
   <h2>Examples</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Google DeepMind's "AlphaFold" is an AI model that predicts protein folding, which has massive potential for developing life-saving drugs and treatments. The U.K. will have a chance to preview this technology and to collaborate with Google DeepMind to maximize its potential whilst minimizing any associated risks.</li>
    <li>OpenAI's "GPT-3" is an AI language model that can complete texts, write articles and even produce poetry. It has already made waves on social media as people share its eerily human-like output. The U.K. will be able to preview and guide the development of this technology to ensure that it is used ethically and responsibly.</li>
    <li>Anthropic is a new AI startup that is focused on developing technology that is both powerful and beneficial for humanity. The U.K. will have early access to their latest AI models, which will include cutting-edge research on reinforcement learning, which has applications in robotics and automation, and natural language processing, which has applications in chatbots and customer service.</li>
   </ol>

    <li>This is a significant development as it offers the U.K. a chance to be at the forefront of new breakthroughs in AI and to guide the development of this technology in a responsible and ethical way.</li>
    <li>The preview of new AI models will allow the U.K. to collaborate with the companies to maximize the benefits of AI whilst minimizing any associated risks.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
   <p>John is a professor of computer science at a leading university in the U.K. He is looking forward to working with OpenAI's "GPT-3" model to research how AI can be used to improve educational material. With early access, he hopes to shape the technology in a way that will support online learning and ensure that students have access to high-quality education regardless of their background or resources.</p>
   <p>Simone is a data scientist working for a health care provider. She is excited about the opportunity to work with Google DeepMind's "AlphaFold" to develop new treatments and medications. With early access, she hopes to collaborate with other scientists and developers to find new ways to improve public health and to help save lives.</p>
   <h2>Tips on Maximizing Benefits and Minimizing Risks</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Treat AI with respect - use it to support human decision-making and not replace it entirely.</li>
    <li>Ensure transparency and accountability in the development and implementation of AI.</li>
    <li>Encourage interdisciplinary collaboration to maximize the potential of AI whilst minimizing any associated risks.</li>
    <li>Conduct regular risk assessments and audits to ensure that AI is being used ethically and responsibly.</li>
    <li>Develop a framework for ethical AI that can be used as a set of best practices to guide the development and implementation of AI across industries.</li>
