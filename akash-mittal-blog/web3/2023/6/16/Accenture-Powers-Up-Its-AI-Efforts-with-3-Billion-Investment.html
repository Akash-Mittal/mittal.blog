   <p>When Tom, an IT analyst at a Fortune 500 company, logs into his work account every morning, he's greeted by his company's virtual assistant, which helps him prioritize tasks, schedules his meetings, and even predicts the data models he'll be working with that day. Tom trusts his AI-powered assistant to help him through his day, and he couldn't imagine working without it. Many companies are following suit, leveraging the power of artificial intelligence to streamline their operations, automate tasks, and generate insights that were previously impossible to uncover.</p>
   <p>Accenture, a global professional services company that provides consulting, technology, and outsourcing services, is one such company that recognizes the potential of AI.
