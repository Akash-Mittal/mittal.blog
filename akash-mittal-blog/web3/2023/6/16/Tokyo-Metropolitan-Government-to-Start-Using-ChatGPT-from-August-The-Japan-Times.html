   <article>
    <p>The Tokyo Metropolitan Government recently announced its plan to start using ChatGPT from August for various tasks. ChatGPT, which is short for Chat-Generated Pretraining Transformer, is an AI tool that can generate human-like responses to text prompts based on its training data.</p>
    <p>This news sparked interest among many people who are curious about the capabilities of this new AI tool. To give an idea of how ChatGPT can be used in practical situations, let's start with a story.</p>
    <h2>A ChatGPT-Assisted Job Interview</h2>
    <p>Yuki, a recent graduate, applied for a job at a large corporation in Tokyo. He passed the initial screening and was invited for an interview with the HR manager. On the day of the interview, Yuki was nervous but also curious about the company's use of AI tools.</p>
    <p>At the interview, the HR manager explained that part of the interview would be conducted with ChatGPT's assistance. Yuki was asked to provide a short essay on his strengths and weaknesses as a candidate. The HR manager then input Yuki's essay into the ChatGPT system and let the AI tool generate some follow-up questions based on Yuki's answers.</p>
    <p>What surprised Yuki was that the questions were not just generic follow-up questions, but they were reflective of his answers and showed some understanding of his personality and strengths. Yuki was impressed and felt that the company was really using AI tools in a thoughtful and effective manner.</p>
    <h2>Practical Uses of ChatGPT by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government</h2>
    <p>Like the hypothetical corporation in Yuki's interview, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government also plans to use ChatGPT in a thoughtful and effective manner. According to Gov. Koike, the metropolitan government will use ChatGPT for tasks such as preparing some documents and seeking input from its employees about other practical uses for the AI tool.</p>
    <p>There are many potential applications for ChatGPT in government services. For example, it could be used to generate personalized responses to frequently asked questions or to assist in language translation for non-native speakers. It could also be used to analyze large amounts of text data from social media and other public sources to help the government understand public opinion on various issues.</p>
    <h2>Some Limitations of ChatGPT</h2>
    <p>While the potential uses of ChatGPT are exciting, it's important to note that the AI tool is not without limitations. First, ChatGPT's responses are only as good as the data it was trained on. This means that if the ChatGPT system was trained on biased or inaccurate data, its responses could also be biased or inaccurate.</p>
    <p>Second, ChatGPT is not designed to replace human interaction but rather to assist it. There will always be situations that require human judgment and empathy, and ChatGPT cannot replicate that completely.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>As the Tokyo Metropolitan Government starts using ChatGPT from August, it's important to stay curious and engaged with the development of AI tools in our daily lives. While these tools have great potential, they also require responsible use and consideration of their limitations.</p>
