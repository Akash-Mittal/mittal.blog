    <h2>A Story about the Challenge</h2>
    <p>It all started when Charlie Puth, the Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter, challenged ChatGPT, an online writing community, to write a song. The challenge was simple but tough - to write a song that would fit Charlie Puth's style and genre. ChatGPT took the challenge and started brainstorming. It was not an easy task to come up with lyrics and music that would resonate with Charlie Puth's audience, but after a few days of hard work, the song was ready.</p>

    <h2>Examples of the Song's Lyrics and Music</h2>
    <p>Here are the lyrics and music that ChatGPT came up with:</p>
    <h3>Verse 1</h3>
    <p>I don't need your promises<br>
      You've broken them all before<br>
      I won't let you in no more<br>
      Got a heart just like a fortress</p>
    <h3>Chorus</h3>
    <p>Do you feel me, babe?<br>
      Cause I can't feel you no more<br>
      Ain't nothing left to say<br>
      Oh, baby, walk right out that door</p>
    <h3>Verse 2</h3>
    <p>You thought you had the upper hand<br>
      But I won't play your games no more<br>
      I'm picking up the pieces<br>
      And I won't let you bring me down</p>
    <h3>Chorus</h3>
    <p>Do you feel me, babe?<br>
      Cause I can't feel you no more<br>
      Ain't nothing left to say<br>
      Oh, baby, walk right out that door</p>
    <p>The song has a catchy chorus, with a simple but effective melody. The lyrics express a feeling of empowerment and moving on from a toxic relationship. The production is minimalistic, with a piano and some electronic sounds that supplement the vocals. The song sounds like something that could fit in Charlie Puth's discography, with its pop sensibility and melodic hooks.</p>
