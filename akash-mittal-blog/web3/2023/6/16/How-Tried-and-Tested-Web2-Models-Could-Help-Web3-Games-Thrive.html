   <h2>The Story of Web3 Games</h2>
   <p>Web3 games are the future. They offer a decentralized gaming experience that is more transparent, secure, and fair. However, despite their many benefits, Web3 games are struggling to gain traction among mainstream gamers. This is because they lack the tried-and-tested models and features that made Web2 games so successful. In this article, we will explore how the strengths of Web2 models could be applied to Web3 games to help them thrive.</p>
   <h2>How Higher-Quality Gameplay Can Help Web3 Games</h2>
   <p>One of the biggest challenges facing Web3 games is the perception that they offer inferior gameplay compared to Web2 games. While this may be true in some cases, it is not a universal truth. Many Web3 games have the potential to rival or surpass Web2 games when it comes to gameplay quality. However, they need to focus on developing high-quality games that are fun and engaging to play. By doing so, Web3 games can attract more users who are looking for a rewarding gaming experience.</p>
   <h3>Example: Axie Infinity</h3>
   <p>Axie Infinity is a Web3 game that has achieved a significant level of success by focusing on gameplay quality. The game is an online multiplayer game that lets players collect, breed, and battle creatures called Axies. It has a simple, intuitive gameplay system that is easy to learn, but difficult to master. The game also has a robust community that supports it, which helps to keep players engaged and motivated.</p>
   <h2>How a Completely Free Experience Can Help Web3 Games</h2>
   <p>Another challenge facing Web3 games is that many of them require players to pay for the privilege of playing. This can be a significant barrier for entry for many gamers who are used to playing Web2 games that are completely free. To help Web3 games thrive, developers should consider making their games completely free to play. This will help to lower the barrier for entry and make it easier for players to try out new games.</p>
   <h3>Example: CryptoKitties</h3>
   <p>CryptoKitties is a Web3 game that has gone completely free-to-play. The game lets players buy, breed, and sell virtual cats on the blockchain. While the game was initially launched with a pay-to-play model, the developers realized that this was hindering its growth potential. By shifting to a free-to-play model, CryptoKitties was able to attract a much wider audience and grow its user base exponentially.</p>

   <h2> or Case Studies</h2>
   <p>As a gamer, I have played both Web2 and Web3 games. While I appreciate the benefits of Web3 games, I often find myself going back to Web2 games because they offer a more polished and engaging experience. However, after playing games like Axie Infinity and CryptoKitties, I can see the potential for Web3 games to rival and surpass Web2 games when it comes to gameplay quality and engagement.</p>
