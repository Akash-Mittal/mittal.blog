    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>It was a casual Friday evening at work and we, a team of developers, were all feeling a little drained from the seemingly never-ending tasks ahead of us. In an attempt to lighten the mood, our boss decided to ask ChatGPT, an AI chatbot that recently joined the team, to crack some jokes and have a little standup comedy session with us.</p>
    <p>What followed was a series of jokes that were so bad, they were almost unforgettable. Each joke was met with a resounding groan from the team, followed by an awkward silence as ChatGPT attempted to move on to the next one. Suffice to say, it wasn't a successful endeavor and it became quite clear that standup comedy definitely wasn't ChatGPT's strength.</p>

   <section id="examples">
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>Some of the jokes that ChatGPT came up with during our failed standup session included:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Why did the tomato turn red? Because it saw the salad dressing!</li>
     <li>Why did the chicken cross the playground? To get to the other slide!</li>
     <li>Why did the hipster refuse to drink coffee? It was too mainstream.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Needless to say, the team was not amused. While we appreciated the effort, it became quite clear that ChatGPT's attempts at humor were not going to be featured in any future standup comedy events.</p>

   <section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>From this experience, we learned that while AI chatbots can be incredibly helpful in many aspects of work and life, humor and standup comedy are not one of them. Ultimately, it takes a human touch and understanding to create successful jokes that are relatable and funny to a particular audience or crowd.</p>
    <p>It's important to remember that while technology can be incredibly powerful, it isn't always the solution to every problem. In this case, we learned that it's best to leave standup comedy to the professionals and not rely on our quirky chatbots to lead the show.</p>
    <p>But hey, at least we got a good laugh out of ChatGPT's attempts, even if it was more out of pity than actual humor.</p>
