   <h2>The Story of PAEMST Finalists</h2>
   <p>The Presidential Awards for Excellence in Math and Science Teaching (PAEMST) is the highest honor for K-12 science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and/or computer science teaching in the United States. The Awards have been presented every year since 1983. Each year, up to five educators in each state, the District of Columbia, the Department of Defense Education Activity, and Puerto Rico are recognized for their contributions to teaching excellence.</p>
   <div class="example">
    <h3>Example 1: A Passionate Math Teacher</h3>
    <p>One of the finalists for PAEMST award this year is James Smith, a math teacher from St. Louis, Missouri. James has been teaching for over 20 years and has a reputation for being passionate about his subject. His favorite thing about teaching is seeing the "aha" moment in his students when they finally understand a difficult concept. He uses real-world examples to make complex math problems more accessible to his students.</p>

    <h3>Example 2: A Creative Science Teacher</h3>
    <p>Another finalist for the award is Sarah Johnson, a science teacher from Portland, Oregon. Sarah has been teaching for 10 years and loves to make science fun and engaging for her students. She uses hands-on experiments and activities to help her students understand abstract concepts. She has also created a school science club where students can explore their interests in science and technology outside of the classroom.</p>
