   <p>In the world of finance, a revolution is underway. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are changing the way we think about money, transactions and trust. And as the global digital economy grows, so does the demand for people skilled in the use of these technologies. One city that is facing a particular shortage is Hong Kong, which is in need of 100,000 crypto workers to help build the future of finance.</p><!-- Examples -->
   <h2>Examples</h2>
   <p>One industry insider, Stanley Chan, has called the shortage of crypto talent in Hong Kong a "crisis". Speaking to <em>Cointelegraph Magazine</em>, Chan said that companies were struggling to find people with the right skills and knowledge. "We need people who understand both the technology and the finance side," he said. "It's not enough to just understand blockchain, you also need to understand what makes a good financial product."</p>
   <p>One solution that has been proposed is to train workers in mainland China, where the government is investing heavily in blockchain technology. The Beijing-based company, Linktime, has already launched a blockchain training program, which has attracted hundreds of students. According to the company's CEO, Qian Wenjie, "We think there is huge potential for blockchain in finance, and we want to help people get the skills they need to take advantage of that."</p>
   <p>Another company that is taking a proactive approach is the blockchain start-up, CryptoBLK. The company has launched a "Crypto University" in Hong Kong, which offers courses in blockchain development, crypto trading and smart contract design. The co-founder of the company, Duncan Wong, said that they were "passionate about blockchain" and wanted to help build a strong community in Hong Kong and beyond.</p><!-- Conclusion -->
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>Hong Kong has long been a hub for finance and innovation, and the city is well placed to become a leader in the world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. However, to make that happen, it needs skilled workers who can help build the future of finance. With the right training and support, Hong Kong can unlock the potential of blockchain and create a thriving digital economy.</p><!-- Tips -->
