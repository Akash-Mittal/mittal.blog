   <h2>Story</h2>
   <p>The Beatles are considered one of the greatest bands of all time, and their music has transcended generations. However, there has always been a sense of incompleteness among fans as they never got to hear the band's final song. But now, thanks to artificial intelligence, that has changed.</p>
   <p>According to Sir Paul McCartney, machine learning technology has enabled the final song to be created by lifting John Lennon's voice from a demo and turning it into a full-fledged song.</p>

   <h2>Examples</h2>
   <p>This incredible feat of AI is just one example of how technology is revolutionizing the music industry. Here are a few more:</p>
   <h3>1. Music composition</h3>
   <p>Artificial intelligence is capable of composing music in a way that mimics how humans do it, but with greater accuracy and speed. In 2016, a team of researchers at Sony CSL Paris created an AI that could produce original pieces of music that sounded like they had been composed by Bach.</p>
   <h3>2. Music transcription</h3>
   <p>Transcribing music manually can be a time-consuming and painstaking process. But with the help of AI, it can be done quickly and accurately. The technology is capable of recognizing and transcribing different parts of a song, from the melody to the rhythm.</p>
   <h3>3. Song recommendation</h3>
   <p>Music streaming platforms like Spotify are using artificial intelligence to recommend new songs to their users. Algorithms analyze a user's listening habits and suggest songs that they might like based on their preferences.</p>

   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The use of artificial intelligence in music is still in its infancy, but it's clear that it has the potential to be a game-changer. From helping create new music to simplifying the transcription and recommendation processes, there are many benefits to be had.</p>
   <p>As AI technology continues to advance, it will be fascinating to see what other innovations it brings to the music industry and beyond.</p>
