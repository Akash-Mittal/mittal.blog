    <h2>A Story</h2>
    <p>Imagine you're a data scientist working on a project that involves generating text or images. You've got a dataset, but it's not labeled, and labeling it manually would take months or even years. How do you proceed?</p>
    <p>This is where Snorkel AI comes in. Their platform allows you to programmatically label your data using what they call "weak supervision". This means you're not relying on humans to do the labeling, but rather on rules and heuristics that you specify. It's not perfect, but it's a lot faster and more scalable than doing it by hand.</p>
   </section>

    <h2>New Capabilities</h2>
    <p>Snorkel AI is now taking things a step further with the introduction of new capabilities that go beyond data labeling. With these new tools, you can not only label your data, but also curate and prepare it for generative AI. This means you can:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Combine multiple labeled datasets into a single one</li>
     <li>Clean and preprocess your data</li>
     <li>Split your data into training and validation sets</li>
     <li>Augment your data with synthetic examples</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All of these tasks are essential for building high-quality generative AI models, and Snorkel AI is making them easier and more automated than ever before.</p>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>Let's look at a few examples of how Snorkel AI's new capabilities can be used in practice:</p>
    <h3>Example 1: Combining Datasets</h3>
    <p>You're building a text generation model that needs to be trained on a large and diverse set of texts. However, you don't have access to a single dataset that covers all the topics and styles you need. Instead, you have several smaller datasets that each cover a different domain (e.g. news, social media, academic articles, etc.).</p>
    <p>Using Snorkel AI, you can combine these datasets into a single one, programmatically labeling each text with its domain. This way, your model can learn to generate text that's appropriate for each domain, without you having to manually label thousands of texts yourself.</p>
    <h3>Example 2: Cleaning Data</h3>
    <p>You've downloaded a huge dataset of unlabeled images that you want to use to train a computer vision model. However, the dataset is noisy and contains many duplicates, low-quality images, and irrelevant photos. You could spend weeks manually filtering and cleaning the dataset, or you could use Snorkel AI to do it for you.</p>
    <p>With Snorkel AI, you can set up rules that automatically discard images that are too small, too blurry, or too similar to each other. You can also cluster similar images together and filter out duplicates. This way, you end up with a clean and diverse dataset that's ready to be used for training.</p>
    <h3>Example 3: Augmenting Data</h3>
    <p>You have a small dataset of labeled texts that you want to use to train a language model. However, you know that the model will benefit from more examples, especially from rare or specific cases. Instead of manually searching for more texts and labeling them, you can use Snorkel AI to generate synthetic examples that are similar to the ones you already have.</p>
    <p>This is possible because Snorkel AI can learn from your labeled data and use that knowledge to generate new texts that follow the same patterns and rules. You can then combine these synthetic examples with your original dataset and use them for training.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Snorkel AI is a powerful platform that's changing the way we approach data labeling and preparation for AI. By offering new capabilities that go beyond labeling, they're enabling data scientists and researchers to build better and more complex generative AI models, without sacrificing time or quality. If you're working on a project that involves generative AI, Snorkel AI is definitely worth exploring.</p>
