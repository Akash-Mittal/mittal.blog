  <p>The world of gaming has been transformed by the advent of blockchain technology and digital collectibles. Dapper Labs, the creator of the viral blockchain game CryptoKitties, has made a strategic investment in GameOn, a rising player in the world of Web3 gaming and digital collectibles.</p>
  <h2>A story about the changing world of gaming</h2>
  <p>Gone are the days of traditional gaming, where players were limited to the games available on consoles or PCs. Today, gamers can experience an entirely new dimension of gaming â€“ one that is enabled by blockchain technology and digital collectibles. The world of blockchain gaming offers a level of immersion that was once thought impossible, where players can truly own their in-game assets and even trade them on an open marketplace.</p>
  <h2>Examples of current trends in blockchain gaming</h2>
  <p>One example is the game Axie Infinity, which has exploded in popularity in recent months. In Axie Infinity, players can collect and breed creatures called Axies, which they can battle against other players. Axies are represented as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which means that they are unique and cannot be replicated. This gives players a sense of ownership over their creatures, as they truly do own them as digital assets. The popularity of Axie Infinity has skyrocketed, with some players earning thousands of dollars per month just by playing the game.</p>
  <p>Another trend in blockchain gaming is the concept of play-to-earn, where players are rewarded for their time spent in-game. This is made possible by the use of cryptocurrency-based incentives and NFTs, which can be earned by completing in-game challenges or tasks.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion: The future of gaming and blockchain technology</h2>
  <p>The investment by Dapper Labs in GameOn is a strong sign of the future direction of gaming. As blockchain technology becomes more advanced, we can expect to see a multitude of new games and platforms that incorporate NFTs, cryptocurrency, and other blockchain-based elements. This has the potential to revolutionize the gaming industry, creating a new world of immersive, engaging, and rewarding experiences for players all over the world.</p>
