     <h2>The Story</h2>
    </header>
    <p>John is an entrepreneur who runs a small business. He has a team of five employees who manage various tasks related to the business. However, John finds it difficult to keep track of each employee's progress and ensure that they complete their tasks on time. He spends most of his time following up with his team members, which hinders his ability to focus on other important aspects of the business.</p>
    <p>One day John stumbled upon Auto-GPT, which promised to help automate prompts and execute tasks in a jiffy. Skeptical at first, John decided to give it a try and was pleasantly surprised by the results.</p>

     <h2>What is Auto-GPT?</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Auto-GPT is an AI-based automation tool that helps to automate prompts and execute tasks with the help of the GPT-3 (Generative Pre-train Transformer) language model. It uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand human commands and assists in automating routine tasks to save time and increase productivity.</p>
    <p>The tool was developed by OpenAI and is similar to the language model used in the popular writing assistant "Grammarly." Auto-GPT is capable of handling a range of tasks, including email automation, scheduling appointments, generating reports, and much more.</p>

								f"\nFrom: {YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS}"
								f"\nTo: john.doe@email.com"
								f"\nSubject: Greetings from Auto-GPT"
								)
					parameters = {
					    "temperature": 0.6,
					    "max_tokens": 60,
					    "n": 1,
					    "stop": "\n"
						}
					
					# Use the OpenAI API to generate email content
					response = openai.Completion.create(
						engine=model_engine,
					    prompt=prompt,
					    max_tokens=parameters['max_tokens'],
					    n=parameters['n'],
					    stop=parameters['stop'],
					    temperature=parameters['temperature']
					)
					
					# Print the email content generated by Auto-GPT
					print(response.choices[0].text)
				</code>
