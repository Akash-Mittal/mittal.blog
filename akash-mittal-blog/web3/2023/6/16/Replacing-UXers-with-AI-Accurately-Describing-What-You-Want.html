    <h2>A Personal Story</h2>
    <p>As a UX designer, I once received a brief from a client who wanted to create a mobile app for their business. However, upon further discussion, it became apparent that the client had no clear understanding of their target audience or their needs. They simply wanted an app because their competitors had one. This lack of clarity and understanding made it difficult for me to create an effective UX design that met their needs.</p>

    <h2>Why Accurate Descriptions are Crucial for Replacing UXers with AI</h2>
    <p>In recent years, there has been increasing discussion about the possibility of using artificial intelligence (AI) to replace UX designers. While AI has its benefits, such as being able to quickly analyze data and provide insights, it still lacks the human element required for creating effective UX designs. To replace UXers with AI, clients and stakeholders must accurately describe what they want.</p>
    <h3>Example: AI vs. Human in UX Design</h3>
    <p>For instance, an AI can analyze user data and determine which color scheme or layout is most effective for a particular audience. However, it cannot understand the emotional needs or preferences of that audience. A human UX designer, on the other hand, can use their intuition and experience to create designs that not only meet the client's needs but also evoke positive emotions in users.</p>
    <p>Therefore, to create a successful UX design, it is important to have a clear understanding of the user's needs, wants, and emotions.</p>

    <h2>How to Accurately Describe What You Want as a Client or Stakeholder</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips for accurately describing what you want as a client or stakeholder:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Have a clear understanding of your target audience's needs and wants</li>
     <li>Provide examples of designs or features that you like or dislike</li>
     <li>Explain the problem you are trying to solve</li>
     <li>Be open to suggestions from the UX designer</li>
     <li>Provide feedback on designs as soon as possible</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Example: Accurately Describing Target Audience</h3>
    <p>For instance, if you are creating a mobile app for a food delivery service, it is important to have a clear understanding of your target audience's preferences. Are they health-conscious? Do they prefer fast food or gourmet meals? Do they have any dietary restrictions? Having this information will allow the UX designer to create a design that not only meets the client's needs but also appeals to the target audience.</p>
