    <h2>A Story</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time, there was a company that wanted to automate its user experience design process. The company believed that using artificial intelligence (AI) could help them create better designs faster and cheaper. They hired a team of developers to build an AI tool that could replace their UX designers. However, the results were not what they expected, and the company realized that replacing UXers with AI is not as simple as they thought.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>Google's AutoDraw - an AI-based tool that helps users draw digital sketches by predicting what they're trying to draw and offering suggestions.</li>
     <li>Synthetic data generation - companies can use AI to generate synthetic data sets for testing and prototyping, which can save time and resources.</li>
     <li>The Grid - an AI-powered website builder that promises to create custom designs based on user input. However, reviews have been mixed, with some users reporting frustration with the limited customization options.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>AI can assist UX designers in some tasks, such as data analysis and prototyping, but it's unlikely to replace them entirely.</li>
     <li>UX design involves empathy, creativity, and problem-solving abilities that are difficult to replicate with AI.</li>
     <li>Human-centered design should always come first, and AI should be used as a tool to enhance the user experience, not replace it.</li>
    </ol>
