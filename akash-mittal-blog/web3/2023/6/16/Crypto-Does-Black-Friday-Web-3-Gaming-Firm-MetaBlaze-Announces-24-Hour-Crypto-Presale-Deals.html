   <h2>The Story</h2>
   <p>It's Black Friday, and shoppers everywhere are looking for deals. But what about the world of crypto? It seems that even the gaming industry is getting in on the action. MetaBlaze, a web 3 gaming firm, has announced a 24-hour crypto presale deal that's sure to attract buyers.</p>
   <p>This isn't the first time we've seen crypto and gaming come together. In fact, some of the earliest adopters of crypto were gamers who used it to buy in-game items and currencies. But as the crypto market has grown, so too has its potential use in the gaming industry.</p>
   <p>So what exactly is MetaBlaze offering? According to their website, "We are offering a pre-sale to the MetaBlaze community that rewards early supporters with free access to our games and exclusive in-game content." The presale is for MetaBlaze's native token, BLAZE, which can be used within their various web 3 games.</p>

   <h2>Examples</h2>
   <p>One example of a web 3 game that's already leveraging crypto is Gods Unchained. This online trading card game uses blockchain technology to create unique cards that players can buy, sell, and trade. The game has been successful enough to attract investment from major players like Coinbase Ventures and Galaxy Digital.</p>
   <p>Another example is Splinterlands, a blockchain-based collectible card game that uses the STEEM cryptocurrency to power its economy. Players can earn STEEM by winning matches and selling their cards on the game's marketplace. Some players have even reported earning a full-time income from playing Splinterlands.</p>
   <p>MetaBlaze's presale deal is similar to these examples in that it rewards early supporters with exclusive in-game content. By offering this content to those who purchase BLAZE during the presale, MetaBlaze is incentivizing people to invest in their game and become a part of their community.</p>
