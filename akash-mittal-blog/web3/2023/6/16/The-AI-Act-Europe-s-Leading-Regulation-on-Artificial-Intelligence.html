    <h2>A Story of Emerging AI Technologies</h2>
    <p>John sat at his desk, staring at the screen of his computer. As a junior AI engineer, he was tasked to develop a software that can diagnose diseases through X-ray images, which would be used in hospitals across the globe. John was excited to be part of the team that would revolutionize the healthcare industry, but he couldn't help but feel a bit uneasy. As he read articles online about AI's potential to cause harm – from job displacement to biases – he wondered how the technology he was helping create would be regulated.</p>
    <p>Like John, many people across the world are concerned about how AI is affecting society and the economy. This is why the European Union (EU) has taken the lead in regulating AI through its landmark legislation - the AI act.</p>

    <h2>Examples of AI in Society</h2>
    <p>AI is transforming the world as we know it, and its impact can be seen in various fields, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and more. Some examples of AI in action are:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>In healthcare, AI is used to detect cancer earlier, track the spread of diseases, and assist in surgeries.</li>
     <li>In finance, AI is used to streamline operations, detect frauds, and provide personalized investment advice.</li>
     <li>In transportation, AI is used to optimize logistics, avoid congestion, and improve safety.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, despite AI's potential benefits, there are concerns about its impact on society – from job displacement and data privacy to biases and discrimination.</p>

    <h2>What is the AI Act?</h2>
    <p>The AI act is a set of regulations proposed by the EU to ensure that AI technologies are developed and used in a way that benefits society as a whole. The legislation aims to address the following issues:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Transparency: AI systems must be transparent, which means their workings are explainable and understandable.</li>
     <li>Data Protection: AI systems must respect the privacy and security of data they handle.</li>
     <li>Bias-free: AI systems must be free from biases and discrimination.</li>
     <li>Human-centric: AI systems must prioritize human well-being and safety over other objectives.</li>
     <li>Accountability: AI systems must be accountable for their actions, and those deploying them will be responsible for ensuring they abide by these rules.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By introducing these regulations, the EU aims to create an ethical and trustworthy framework for the development and deployment of AI in society.</p>
