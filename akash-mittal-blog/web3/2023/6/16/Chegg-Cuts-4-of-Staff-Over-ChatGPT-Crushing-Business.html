  <div class="main">
   <div class="intro">
    <p>Chegg, the education technology company that offers digital and physical textbook rentals, tutoring, and other services to students, has disclosed its plans to cut about 4% of its workforce. This comes just a few weeks after the company's CEO, Dan Rosensweig, openly talked about how OpenAI's language model ChatGPT was "crushing" their business.</p>
    <p>For those who aren't familiar with ChatGPT, it's an AI-based language model that can generate human-like responses to text prompts. Basically, it can chat like a human. This technology has many potential uses, from customer service chatbots to personal assistants, but it's also becoming a threat to some businesses that offer similar services.</p>
    <p>Let's take a look at how ChatGPT is affecting Chegg, and what this layoff means for the company and its employees.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="example">
    <h2>Example: Chegg's AI-based tutoring service vs ChatGPT</h2>
    <p>One of Chegg's flagship services is its online tutoring platform, which connects students with real tutors who can help them with their homework and exam preparation. However, ChatGPT is now offering a free, AI-based tutoring service that can answer students' questions in a matter of seconds. While it may not be as personalized and thorough as human tutoring, it's quick and convenient, and it's putting pressure on companies like Chegg to adapt.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="conclusion">
    <h2>What does this mean for Chegg and its employees?</h2>
   </div>
   <ul class="points">
    <li>Chegg may need to reevaluate its business model and offerings to stay competitive in an increasingly AI-driven market.</li>
    <li>The layoffs may bring uncertainty and hardship for affected employees, and it's important for the company to handle the situation with transparency and fairness.</li>
    <li>This is just one example of how AI technology is disrupting industries and changing the job market, and it's crucial for workers to stay informed and adaptable in this rapidly changing landscape.</li>
   </ul>
