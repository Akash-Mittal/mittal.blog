Everything You Need to Know</h1></br> <img src="images/What-is-an-HTTP-Cookie-Everything-You-Need-to-Know.jpeg" alt="+What-is-an-HTTP-Cookie-Everything-You-Need-to-Know+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.androidpolice.com/http-cookie-explainer/" target="_blank" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/http-cookie-explainer/" rel="noopener">https://www.androidpolice.com/http-cookie-explainer/</a></span></h5>
  <p>Have you ever visited a website and got bombarded with ads related to something you searched for earlier? Or wondered how online shopping sites remember what you put in your cart even after closing the website? This is where HTTP cookies come into the picture.</p>
  <h2>What are HTTP cookies?</h2>
  <p>An HTTP cookie is a small text file that a website stores on your device when you visit it. It contains information about your interaction with the website, such as the pages you visited, items you added to your cart, and your login credentials.</p>
  <p>Cookies can be classified into two types: session and persistent. A session cookie gets deleted as soon as you close the website, while a persistent cookie stays on your device for a longer period. Persistent cookies can be used for various purposes, such as keeping you logged in across different sessions or showing you personalized content.</p>
  <h2>How do cookies work?</h2>
  <p>When you visit a website, your web browser sends a request to the server for the webpage. Along with this request, it also sends any cookies that belong to that website. The server can read the cookie and use the information contained within it to customize the webpage for you.</p>
  <p>For example, if you visit an online shopping website and add some items to your cart, a cookie is created that contains the details of the items you selected. If you close the website and come back later, the website can read the cookie and show you the items in your cart. This is how the website remembers what you added to your cart even after closing it.</p>
  <h2>How do cookies influence the information you see online?</h2>
  <p>Cookies are used by websites to track your browsing behavior and show you relevant content and ads. For example, if you search for a product on Google, you may see ads related to that product on other websites you visit. This is because Google uses cookies to track your search history and show you personalized ads.</p>
  <p>However, cookies can also be used to collect your personal information, such as your name, email address, and browsing history. This information can be used by marketers to target you with ads or sold to third-party companies for profit. This is why it's important to be aware of the cookies you allow on your device and to regularly clear them.</p>
