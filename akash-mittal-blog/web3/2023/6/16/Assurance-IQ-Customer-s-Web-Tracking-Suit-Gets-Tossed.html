  <p>A proposed class action accusing Assurance IQ and its software vendor of illegally recording website users' keystrokes and information was thrown out because its claims are time-barred, a California federal court ruled, finding that an amended complaint still did not properly invoke delayed discovery.</p>
  <h2>Story</h2>
  <p>People use the internet for various purposes, including shopping, banking, and staying connected with loved ones. As we continue to move towards a more digital economy, it has become increasingly important to ensure our privacy and security online. In recent years, many companies have faced lawsuits over allegations of data breaches, and Assurance IQ is no exception.</p>
  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p>Assurance IQ, a digital life insurance company, faced a proposed class action accusing them of illegally recording website users' keystrokes and information. The case was thrown out because the claims were time-barred. The plaintiffs failed to properly invoke delayed discovery in the amended complaint, leading the court to dismiss the case. This case highlights the importance of being aware of potential privacy violations and taking action before it's too late.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, it's important for companies to prioritize data privacy and security to protect their customers' personal information. This not only safeguards against potential legal action but also helps to build trust and loyalty with clients. For consumers, it's crucial to remain informed about potential privacy violations and take action to protect their personal information.</p>
