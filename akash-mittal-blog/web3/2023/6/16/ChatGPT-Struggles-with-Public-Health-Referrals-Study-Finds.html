   <h1>ChatGPT Struggles with Public Health Referrals - Study Finds</h1></br> <img src="images/ChatGPT-Struggles-with-Public-Health-Referrals-Study-Finds.jpeg" alt="+ChatGPT-Struggles-with-Public-Health-Referrals-Study-Finds+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/study-finds-chatgpt-struggles-with-public-health-referrals/" target="_blank" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/study-finds-chatgpt-struggles-with-public-health-referrals/" rel="noopener">https://www.cbsnews.com/video/study-finds-chatgpt-struggles-with-public-health-referrals/</a></span></h5>
   <p>A new study in the <em>JAMA Network Open</em> journal found that when ChatGPT was asked about abuse, addiction, suicide or other medical crises, it only returned referrals to critical resources about 22% of the time. But researchers also found the AI tool provided evidence-based responses, like information from the CDC's website, 91% of the time. John Ayers, one of the authors of that study and vice chief of innovation at the University of California San Diego Medicine, joined CBS News to talk about the results.</p>
   <h2>The Problem with ChatGPT</h2>
   <p>In today's digital age, people rely on chatbots and other AI-powered tools to get quick answers to their health-related concerns. However, the study revealed that ChatGPT struggles with public health referrals. According to the study, when asked about abuse, addiction, suicide or other medical crises, ChatGPT only returned referrals to critical resources about 22% of the time. That means, in most cases, people using this tool are unlikely to get the help they need.</p>
   <h3>Why Does ChatGPT Struggle with Public Health Referrals?</h3>
   <p>One of the main reasons why ChatGPT struggles with public health referrals is that it was not specifically designed for this purpose. ChatGPT is a natural language processing (NLP) model that is primarily trained for language-based tasks like language translation, question answering, and summarization. While it can provide information from the CDC's website and other reputable sources, it may not always be able to understand the context and severity of the user's request.</p>
   <p>For instance, when asked about suicide, ChatGPT may provide information on the warning signs and symptoms of suicide, but it may not be able to recognize when someone is in immediate danger and needs urgent help.</p>
   <h2>The Importance of Public Health Referrals</h2>
   <p>Public health referrals play a crucial role in connecting people with the resources and support they need. For individuals struggling with abuse, addiction, suicide or other medical crises, timely access to appropriate care can be a matter of life or death.</p>
   <p>That's why it's essential for AI-based tools like ChatGPT to be able to provide accurate and relevant referrals to critical resources. While ChatGPT may not be the ideal tool for this purpose, there are other chatbots and AI-powered tools that are specifically designed to address public health concerns.</p>
   <h3>Examples of Effective Public Health Referral Tools</h3>
   <p>One example of an effective public health referral tool is Crisis Text Line, a free, 24/7 text-based support service for people in crisis. This service uses trained crisis counselors and AI-powered technology to provide immediate help and referrals to people experiencing mental health crises.</p>
   <p>Another example is Woebot, an AI-powered chatbot that provides evidence-based mental health support and referrals to users. Woebot uses cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques to help people manage their mental health and connects users with local resources based on their location.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <div class="conclusion">
    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
    <ol>
     <li>ChatGPT struggles with public health referrals, returning critical resources only 22% of the time.</li>
     <li>ChatGPT is not specifically designed for public health referrals and may not always understand the context and severity of the user's request.</li>
     <li>Other chatbots and AI-powered tools like Crisis Text Line and Woebot are specifically designed for public health concerns and provide effective referrals to critical resources.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3></h3>
    <p>As a healthcare professional, I have seen firsthand the importance of timely and accurate public health referrals. Patients who receive appropriate referrals are more likely to get the care they need and are less likely to experience negative outcomes like hospitalization or death. It's crucial for AI-based tools like ChatGPT to be able to provide effective referrals to users in need.</p>
