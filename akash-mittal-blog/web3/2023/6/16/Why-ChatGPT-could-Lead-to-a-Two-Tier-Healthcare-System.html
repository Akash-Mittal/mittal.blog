   <h2>A Story</h2>
   <p>Imagine you are feeling unwell and you decide to seek medical advice. However, instead of going to your doctor's office, you decide to use an AI-enabled healthcare system called ChatGPT. You log in and start answering a series of questions about your symptoms. After a few minutes, the system diagnoses you with a mild case of flu and prescribes some medication.</p>
   <p>You are relieved that you don't have to leave your house and you didn't have to wait for an appointment. In fact, you are so impressed with ChatGPT that you decide to use it for all your future medical needs.</p>
   <p>However, what you don't realize is that by relying solely on ChatGPT, you could be contributing to the creation of a 'two-tier' healthcare system.</p>
   <h2>Examples</h2>
   <p>AI-enabled healthcare systems like ChatGPT are becoming increasingly popular because they promise to reduce healthcare costs and improve efficiency. However, this comes at a cost. By relying on these systems, patients may be missing the opportunity to receive personalized care and develop trusting relationships with their healthcare providers.</p>
   <p>Moreover, these systems are not available to everyone. Patients who lack access to technology or who have limited digital literacy may not be able to use ChatGPT or similar systems. Therefore, by relying on these systems, we risk creating a 'two-tier' healthcare system where some patients have access to cutting-edge technology while others are left behind.</p>
   <p>Finally, these systems may not be fully interoperable with other healthcare technologies. For example, if a patient uses ChatGPT to receive a diagnosis, the system may not be able to automatically send that information to the patient's electronic health record. This could result in fragmented care and reduce the quality of the care patients receive.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>AI-enabled healthcare systems like ChatGPT may be useful in certain circumstances, but we must be careful not to rely on them too heavily. We also need to ensure that they are available to everyone and that they are fully interoperable with other healthcare technologies.</p>
   <p>Personalized care and trust-based relationships between patients and healthcare providers are important for achieving good health outcomes. These cannot be replaced by technology. Therefore, we must use AI-enabled healthcare systems like ChatGPT as a complementary tool rather than a replacement for traditional healthcare.</p>
   <p>As we move towards a more digital healthcare system, it's important that we don't leave anyone behind. We must ensure that all patients have access to the tools they need to achieve good health outcomes. In doing so, we can avoid the creation of a 'two-tier' healthcare system and improve healthcare for all.</p>
