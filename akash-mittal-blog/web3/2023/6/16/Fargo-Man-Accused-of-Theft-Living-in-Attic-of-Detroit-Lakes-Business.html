  <p>It's not every day that you hear about someone living in the attic of a business, but that's exactly what happened in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota. According to reports, a Fargo man was accused of theft and found living in the attic of a local business. The discovery was made when employees heard strange noises coming from the ceiling and went to investigate. What they found was the man, who had apparently been living in the attic for several days.</p>
  <p>This bizarre tale is just one in a string of recent theft and burglary cases in the area. In a separate case, federal authorities have picked up a gun burglary case in Becker County. These incidents serve as a reminder of how important it is to stay safe and secure, both at home and at work.</p>

   <li>In 2020, two men were arrested in Detroit Lakes after allegedly breaking into a home and stealing a safe, cash, and jewelry.</li>
  </ul>
