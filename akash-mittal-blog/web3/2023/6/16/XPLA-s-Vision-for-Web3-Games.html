     <h3>The Beginnings of a Vision</h3>
     <p>The year was 2020. The world was locked down due to the global pandemic. Online gaming saw a surge in popularity as people turned to games to escape from the harsh realities of the pandemic. But while playing games, we realized that something was missing. The games felt flat and one-dimensional, lacking the depth and immersion that we craved. And that's when the vision dawned on us.</p>
     <p>What if we could bring real-world elements into online games and create a new dimension of gaming that was more immersive, more realistic, and more enjoyable than what we have today? What if we could merge the physical and digital worlds to create an entirely new gaming experience? Thus, the vision for web3 games was born.</p>

     <h3>Examples of Web3 Games</h3>
     <p>Web3 games take online gaming to a whole new level. In these games, players can use real-world assets such as currencies, NFTs, and other digital assets to enhance their gameplay and even monetize it. Here are some examples of web3 games that exist today:</p>
     <ul>
      <li><em>Axie Infinity:</em> Players can collect and breed digital creatures called Axies which can be used in battles or traded on an open marketplace.</li>
      <li><em>The Sandbox:</em> Players buy virtual land that they own and can use to build games, experiences, or sell them to others in the game.</li>
      <li><em>Decentraland:</em> Players can own virtual real estate, create experiences, and monetize their creations on an open marketplace.</li>
      <li><em>CryptoKitties:</em> Collectible digital cats that can be bred, sold, and traded using Ethereum blockchain technology.</li>
      <li><em>Zed Run:</em> Race digital horses and train them to win races or sell them on a marketplace.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>These examples illustrate how web3 games are more than just games; they're a new type of economy that allows players to interact with each other and the game in ways that were previously impossible.</p>
