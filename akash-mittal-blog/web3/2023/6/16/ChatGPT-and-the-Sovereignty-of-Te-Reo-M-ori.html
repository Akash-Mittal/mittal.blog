  <p>Te Reo Māori, the indigenous language of New Zealand, has been a significant part of the country's culture and identity for over a thousand years. However, the increasing use of artificial intelligence and chatbots, such as ChatGPT, has raised concerns among some Māori about the loss of sovereignty of their language. What impact will ChatGPT have on Te Reo Māori? Data sovereignty experts weigh in.</p>
  <h2>A Story of Language and Technology</h2>
  <p>Imagine a scenario where you need to book a flight online. You visit the website of your preferred airline and click on the chatbot icon to start a conversation. The conversation goes something like this:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Chatbot: Hello! How may I assist you today?</li>
   <li>You: Hi! I would like to book a flight from Auckland to Wellington on the 10th of August.</li>
   <li>Chatbot: Sure, I can help with that. Can you please provide me with your name and date of birth?</li>
   <li>You: My name is John Smith, and my date of birth is the 2nd of January 1990.</li>
   <li>Chatbot: Thank you, John! I have found some flights for you. Which one do you prefer: the 8 am flight or the 12 pm flight?</li>
   <li>You: I prefer the 8 am flight.</li>
   <li>Chatbot: Great! Your flight has been booked. Is there anything else I can assist you with?</li>
   <li>You: No, that's all. Thank you!</li>
   <li>Chatbot: Thank you, John! Have a nice day! Ka kite anō!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Did you notice the last sentence of the chatbot's response? "Ka kite anō!" is Māori for "See you again!" The use of Māori language in artificial intelligence and chatbots is becoming more frequent in New Zealand due to the country's efforts to promote the language and make it more accessible. This may seem like a positive development, but there are concerns about the implications of such usage for the sovereignty of the language.</p>
  <h2>The Concerns of Māori</h2>
  <p>Many Māori are concerned that the increasing use of artificial intelligence and chatbots may lead to the loss of sovereignty of Te Reo Māori. Sovereignty refers to the right of a group to control their language and culture without outside interference. The use of Māori language in artificial intelligence and chatbots controlled by non-Māori companies or individuals could compromise this right.</p>
  <p>Another concern is the potential loss of control over the language data. Chatbots like ChatGPT use machine learning algorithms to understand and respond to user input. This means that the chatbots rely on large amounts of data to function effectively. If the language data used by chatbots are not controlled by Māori, it could lead to a loss of control over the development and use of the language.</p>
  <h2>The Opinions of Data Sovereignty Experts</h2>
  <p>So, what do experts on data sovereignty think about the concerns of Māori regarding the use of artificial intelligence in Te Reo Māori? According to Dr. Karaitiana Taiuru, a Māori data sovereignty expert, the concerns are valid. In an interview with Newsroom, he stated:</p>
  <blockquote>
   "Māori need to have control over Te Reo Māori data, and this includes data used in AI interfaces. It must be owned by Māori primarily, and not any other organisation that doesn't have Māori values."
  </blockquote>
  <p>Dr. Taiuru believes that a data sovereignty model, where Māori would control their language and cultural data and ensure that it is used ethically and sustainably, would be the ideal solution. He also suggested that if non-Māori organisations are involved, they should be required to follow Māori protocols in the use and management of Māori cultural data.</p>
  <p>Another data sovereignty expert, Professor Tahu Kukutai, agrees with Dr. Taiuru. In an interview with RNZ, she emphasized the importance of Māori control over the language data used in artificial intelligence and chatbots, saying:</p>
  <blockquote>
   "Māori should own, govern, and manage Māori data, including language data. It's an important part of digital sovereignty. The implications of not doing so are clear - data used to develop Māori-specific solutions like chatbots will be developed through a lens that prioritizes non-Māori views, values, and experiences."
  </blockquote>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The use of Te Reo Māori in artificial intelligence and chatbots like ChatGPT can have both positive and negative implications. While it can provide greater accessibility to the language, it can also compromise the sovereignty of the language if not controlled by Māori. Data sovereignty experts emphasize the importance of Māori control over the language data used in artificial intelligence and chatbots to ensure the ethical and sustainable development and use of the language.</p>
