  <p>Imagine a world where a dental practitioner can input symptoms, and an AI language model can accurately predict the diagnosis and provide potential treatment options. This is no longer just a figment of our imagination. An artificial intelligence (AI) program called ChatGPT that generates text in response to typed commands has proven to be highly popular, as evidenced by the fact that OpenAI makes it available online.</p>
  <h2>The Potential of ChatGPT in Public Health Dentistry</h2>
  <p>The goal of the present investigation was to investigate ChatGPT's potential applications as an outstanding instance of large language models (LLMs) in the fields of public dental health schooling, writing for academic use, research in public dental health, and clinical practice in public dental health based on the available data. Using search phrases including chatGPT, implications, artificial intelligence (AI), public health dentistry, public health, practice in public health dentistry, education in public health dentistry, academic writing in public health dentistry, etc., a thorough search was carried out on the Pubmed database, the Embase database, the Ovid database, the Global Health database, PsycINFO, and the Web of Science. The dates of publication were not restricted.</p>
  <p>Systematic searches were carried out for all publications according to inclusion and exclusion criteria between March 31, 2018, and March 31, 2023. Eighty-four papers were obtained through a literature search using search terms. Sixteen similar and duplicate papers were excluded, and 68 distinct articles were initially selected. Thirty-three articles were excluded after reviewing abstracts and titles. Thirty-five papers were selected, for which full text was managed. Four extra papers were found manually from references. Thirty-nine articles with full texts were eligible for the study. Eighteen inadequate articles are excluded from the final 21 studies that were finally selected for systemic review.</p>
  <p>According to previously published studies, ChatGPT has demonstrated its effectiveness in helping scholars with the authoring of scientific research and dental studies. If the right structures are created, ChatGPT can offer suitable responses and more time to concentrate on the phase of experimentation for scientists.</p>
  <h3>Risks Associated with the Use of ChatGPT in Public Health Dentistry</h3>
  <p>While the potential benefits of ChatGPT in dentistry are vast, there are still some risks associated with its use. These include prejudice in the training data, undervaluing human skills, the possibility of fraud in science, as well as legal and reproducibility concerns. It is important for dental practitioners to understand these risks and weigh them against the benefits of using ChatGPT in their practice.</p>
  <h2>The Importance of Human Input in Clinical Practice</h2>
  <p>It is important to note that while AI can be useful in a number of ways, a dentist must ultimately make the decision because dentistry is a field that involves several disciplines. Even though ChatGPT can assist with diagnosis and treatment options, clinical practice involves more than just making diagnoses; it also involves relating to clinical findings and providing individualized patient care.</p>
  <p>For example, a patient may have a dental phobia that needs to be addressed before any treatment can begin. While ChatGPT can provide treatment options, it cannot address the patient's phobia or unique needs. Only a human dentist can do that. It is important for dental practitioners to understand the limitations of AI and not rely solely on it for their clinical decision-making.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>It was concluded that practice considering ChatGPT's potential significance, the research's uniqueness, and the premise-the activity of the human brain-remains. While there is no question about the superiority of incorporating ChatGPT into the practice of public health dentistry, it does not, in any way, take the place of a dentist. The use of AI should be considered as an additional tool to assist with diagnosis and treatment options.</p>
