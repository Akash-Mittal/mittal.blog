  <p>Are you looking to trade your yoga mat for a sandy beach? You're in luck! The Parks and Rec department of Bemidji is teaming up with local yoga instructors to offer a new refreshing yoga class on the beach!</p>
  <p>The serene beauty of the beach coupled with the calming and strengthening effects of yoga are sure to make for an unparalleled experience. This exciting new offering is sure to be a hit with yoga enthusiasts and beachgoers alike!</p>
  <h2>The Benefits of Beach Yoga</h2><!-- Here, insert the reasons for approaching yoga at the beach --->
  <ol>
   <li>Stress Relief: Practicing yoga anywhere can have significant physical and psychological benefits. Yoga at the beach takes that impact to another level by providing a peaceful environment to relieve stress, tensions and difficulties of day-to-day life.</li>
   <li>Building Strength and Balance: Performing yoga in an unpredictable surface such as sand helps to engage more muscles as they stabilize against the unsteady surface. Practicing on the beach also provides for extra resistance that strengthens the lower body, core, and arm muscles.</li>
   <li>Improve Overall Wellness: Practicing yoga on the beach has a double effect on overall wellness, combining the benefits of yoga with the positive effects of getting outdoors, and fresh air.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The combination of sand, sun and waves are sure to awaken your senses and leave you feeling revitalized.</p>
  <h2>How to Prepare for Yoga at the Beach</h2><!-- Personal anecdotes and lifestyle considerations when practicing yoga at the beach, such as: sunscreen, water, towel, yoga mat --->
  <p>While beach yoga offers a unique and appealing twist to yoga practice, it's essential to remember that it does come with some additional considerations. Here are some tips to make the experience more enjoyable:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Set the tone: Bring a beach towel or blanket to create a peaceful and comfortable space for your yoga practice.</li>
   <li>Protect yourself: Because you're going to be outside and exposed to the sun, it's essential to protect your skin with sunscreen and a hat. Also, have a drink of water nearby to stay hydrated throughout your practice.</li>
   <li>Get the right gear: A standard yoga mat can become tricky and dangerous in the sand. Instead, consider investing in a sand-resistant mat as it will help you maintain your balance and stability while performing yoga on the beach.</li>
  </ol>
