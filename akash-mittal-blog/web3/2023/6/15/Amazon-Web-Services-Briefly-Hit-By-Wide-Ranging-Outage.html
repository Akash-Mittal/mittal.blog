    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>On Tuesday, Nov. 25, 2021, Amazon Web Services (AWS) suffered a major outage that impacted several major websites that rely on the cloud service. Among the impacted websites were Zoom, Netflix, and The New York Times. The outage lasted for about 40 minutes before AWS was able to restore services.</p>
    <p>The outage was caused by a power issue at a data center in Northern Virginia. This caused a chain reaction that led to the disruption of connectivity between various AWS services.</p>
