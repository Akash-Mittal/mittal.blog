   <p>It was a warm summer's day in Baja California Sur when John Medeski, keyboardist for Medeski Martin &amp; Wood, was struck with an idea. Why not create a music festival in the heart of Baja? An event that would showcase the beauty of the area, the rich cultural heritage, and some of the best musicians on the planet.</p>
   <p>John shared his idea with his bandmates, DJ Logic, and a few other close friends in the music industry. They all agreed it was a fantastic idea and set about making it happen.</p>
