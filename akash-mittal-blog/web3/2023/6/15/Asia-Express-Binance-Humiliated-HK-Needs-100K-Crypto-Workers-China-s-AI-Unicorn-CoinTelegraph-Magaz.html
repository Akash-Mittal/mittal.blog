    <h2>Binance Humiliated</h2>
    <p>One of Asia's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance, recently suffered a major hack that resulted in the loss of more than $40 million worth of Bitcoin. The hack was a significant blow not only to Binance but to the entire crypto industry's reputation in Asia.</p>
    <p>The hack was a result of a sophisticated attack that was carried out over several weeks. The hackers were able to compromise a number of Binance's hot wallets, which are online wallets used to store cryptocurrency funds. Binance has since implemented a number of security upgrades to prevent similar attacks from happening in the future.</p>
    <p>The hack shows just how vulnerable the crypto industry is to cyber attacks, and it underscores the importance of strong security measures and cybersecurity expertise in the industry.</p>
    <p>Despite the setback, Binance remains one of Asia's most popular cryptocurrency exchanges and is still expanding its services and offerings.</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>"The hack was a wake-up call for Binance and the entire crypto industry. We are taking steps to ensure that our security measures are as strong as possible and that our users' funds are safe and secure." - Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance</p>

    <h2>HK Needs 100K Crypto Workers</h2>
    <p>Hong Kong's government is aiming to establish itself as a global hub for fintech and innovation, and it sees the crypto industry as a key component of that ambition. The government recently announced that it would be launching a new program aimed at attracting and training crypto professionals.</p>
    <p>The program will provide funding and support to companies and startups that are involved in blockchain and cryptocurrency development. It will also offer training and certification programs for individuals who want to work in the industry.</p>
    <p>The government hopes that the program will help to establish Hong Kong as a leading center for blockchain and cryptocurrency development and that it will attract as many as 100,000 new crypto workers to the city.</p>
    <p>The move comes as other countries and regions, such as Malta and Singapore, are also positioning themselves as crypto-friendly jurisdictions and competing for talent in the industry.</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>"We believe that the crypto industry has tremendous potential for growth and innovation, and we want to position Hong Kong as a global leader in this space. The program is a key part of that strategy." - Carrie Lam, Chief Executive of Hong Kong</p>

    <h2>China's AI Unicorn</h2>
    <p>SenseTime, a Chinese AI startup, has become the world's most valuable AI unicorn following a recent funding round that raised $600 million.</p>
    <p>The company, which develops facial recognition and other AI technologies, has already established partnerships with major Chinese firms, including China Mobile and Huawei.</p>
    <p>SenseTime's success is an important milestone for China's tech industry, which has been investing heavily in AI and other cutting-edge technologies to try to catch up with the U.S. and other Western countries.</p>
    <p>China's government has also identified AI as a key growth sector and has set a target of becoming a world leader in the industry by 2030.</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>"SenseTime's success is a testament to the impressive innovation and entrepreneurship that is happening in China's tech industry. We believe that AI will play a critical role in shaping the future of our economy and society." - Li Keqiang, Premier of China</p>
