   <h2>Story</h2>
   <p>It was just another regular day for Alex, an online business owner who heavily relies on Amazon Web Services (AWS) for his website operations. However, that day turned out to be a nightmare as Alex's website suddenly went down due to the AWS outage. He started receiving thousands of complaints from his customers, and he had no idea what was going on. After a few frantic phone calls, he found out about the AWS outage that affected thousands of other users as well.</p>

   <h2>Examples</h2>
   <p>The AWS outage affected various websites and apps, including popular ones like Airbnb, Netflix, and Reddit. These companies faced significant losses due to the outage, as they rely on AWS for their website and app operations.</p>
   <p>According to reports, the AWS outage was caused due to a technical glitch that affected its Northern Virginia data center. This caused a major setback for Amazon's cloud computing services, which have become increasingly popular among businesses of all sizes.</p>
   <p>Many companies were forced to find temporary solutions to keep their businesses running during the AWS outage. For instance, Netflix shifted its operations to other cloud computing providers, and Airbnb used Twitter to update its customers about the outage.</p>

    <li>Cloud computing providers need to invest in better technology and infrastructure to prevent such outages from happening in the future.</li>
