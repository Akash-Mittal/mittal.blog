    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming more and more present in our lives. From virtual assistants to autonomous vehicles, we interact with it on a daily basis. However, there is a growing concern that AI could become a problem if not properly managed. This article explores a new book that argues that the solution to the AI quandary is to make it more human and sentimental.</p>
    <h2>A story</h2>
    <p>Imagine you are driving down the highway in your new self-driving car. Suddenly, a truck swerves in front of you. Before you have time to react, the car makes a decision to either hit the truck and risk your safety or swerve into the opposite lane and risk the safety of oncoming traffic. This is the kind of decision-making that AI is being asked to do on a regular basis. But how can we make sure that AI makes the right decision in situations like this?</p>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>The book "The Emotional Life of Your Brain" by Richard J. Davidson argues that the key to solving the AI quandary is to make it more human-like. By teaching AI to recognize and understand human emotions, it will be better equipped to make decisions that are in our best interest. For example, if a self-driving car can recognize when its passengers are feeling anxious or scared, it can adjust its driving behavior to make them feel more at ease.</p>
    <p>Another example is in the field of healthcare. AI is being used to help diagnose and treat patients, but it can also be taught to recognize when a patient is experiencing emotional distress. By doing so, it can provide emotional support in addition to medical care.</p>
    <h2>Personal anecdotes</h2>
    <p>As someone who interacts with AI on a daily basis, I can attest to the fact that it can sometimes feel impersonal. For example, when talking to a virtual assistant, it can be frustrating when it doesn't understand what I'm asking. However, if it were able to recognize my frustration and respond accordingly, it would make the interaction much more pleasant.</p>
    <p>Similarly, in my job as a teacher, I have witnessed the benefits of using AI to assist in teaching. However, I have also seen how it can sometimes be lacking in emotional intelligence. For example, if a student is struggling with a concept and feels discouraged, an AI tutor may not be able to provide the kind of emotional support that a human teacher can.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The solution to the AI quandary is not to stop its development, but to make it more human. By teaching AI to recognize and understand human emotions, we can ensure that it makes decisions that are in our best interest. Personal anecdotes and case studies show that there is a growing need for AI to be more emotionally intelligent. The benefits of doing so are evident in fields as diverse as healthcare and education.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, as AI continues to develop and become ever-more present in our lives, it is up to us to ensure that it is used in a way that benefits humanity. Making it more human and sentimental is a step in the right direction.</p>
