  <p>Introduction:</p>
  <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a buzzword for several years now, and it's expected to transform various industries. Despite its potential, AI has faced several challenges in adoption, and it seems tech companies are currently facing an 'awkward teenage phase' in AI adoption. In this article, we'll explore why tech companies are experiencing this phase and what they can do to overcome it.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Story:</p>
  <p>Let's imagine a tech company XYZ that wanted to incorporate AI into their business processes. They decided to invest in AI-based software to automate their customer service operations. However, they soon realized that the AI algorithm failed to understand the nuances of human language and emotions. Customers were frustrated with the chatbots' responses and started leaving bad reviews. As a result, the company had to revert to human agents to provide customer support. On top of that, the company had invested a considerable sum of money in the software, which didn't provide the desired outcomes. This is a classic example of what many companies face during their initial AI adoption phase.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <p>Tech companies across various industries are struggling to adopt AI due to several reasons. Firstly, AI is still in the developmental stage, and its capabilities are not fully realized. Secondly, AI is constructed by humans, and thus, it inherits human biases and other limitations. Also, AI requires vast amounts of data, and this data needs to be of high quality, which is challenging to obtain. Additionally, implementing AI requires significant infrastructure changes, which can be costly and time-consuming.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion:</p>
  <p>So, what can tech companies do to overcome these challenges and make the most of AI? Firstly, companies should establish realistic expectations from AI and be willing to invest in the technology for the long term. Secondly, companies must ensure that AI is ethically applied and designed to counter human biases. Thirdly, companies must focus on acquiring high-quality data, ensuring data privacy and security while complying with regulations. Lastly, companies can adopt a 'fail fast, learn quickly' approach to overcome setbacks and keep improving.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>/Case Studies:</p>
  <p>We interviewed a tech start-up that realized that their AI algorithms failed to detect nuanced emotions while analyzing social media data. The company pivoted to include human analysts in their AI framework and improved the accuracy of their outputs. This enabled the company to provide more value to their clients and led to better business outcomes.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Tips:</p>
  <p>1. Invest in AI for the long term</p>
  <p>2. Counter human biases in AI algorithms</p>
  <p>3. Focus on acquiring high-quality data</p>
  <p>4. Be agile and pivot quickly based on feedback</p>
