  <p>Samantha, a 63-year-old grandmother, was recently diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with driver oncogenes. The news came as a blow, not just to Samantha, but to her entire family. They knew that lung cancer was one of the most aggressive forms of cancer and usually had a dismal prognosis. Samantha was referred to the University of Illinois Cancer Center, where her oncologist suggested using ChatGPT-generated next-generation sequencing reports to outline treatment strategies.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized cancer care by identifying genetic mutations that drive cancer growth, enabling targeted therapies that offer patients improved outcomes and fewer side effects. However, the analysis of NGS data and the identification of actionable mutations can be time-consuming and challenging for oncologists. This is where ChatGPT (a language processing model) comes in. ChatGPT has demonstrated the potential to analyze electronic medical records (EMR) and generate reports, making it an invaluable tool for oncologists to develop personalized treatment strategies.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In a recent study presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting, investigators from the University of Illinois Cancer Center utilized ChatGPT to develop next-generation sequencing reports that provide treatment recommendations for NSCLC patients with driver oncogenes. The study showed that the recommendation relevance was moderate, but the accuracy was limited, indicating the need for further optimization.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Despite the limitations, ChatGPT could prove to be a valuable asset, especially in under-resourced settings where access to genomic testing and specialists is limited. ChatGPT-generated reports have the potential to accelerate treatment decisions and streamline care for patients with NSCLC, ultimately improving patient outcomes.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Furthermore, ChatGPT-generated NGS reports could also benefit patients with other types of cancer. For instance, gastrointestinal cancer patients may have actionable mutations that suggest personalized treatment strategies such as immunotherapy or targeted therapy, which could be identified through NGS testing. ChatGPT could then analyze the EMR, identify those mutations, and provide recommendations to oncologists, enabling personalized treatment for these patients.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another significant benefit of ChatGPT-generated reports is the potential for real-time tracking of treatment outcomes. Oncologists can use these reports to monitor patients' responses to therapy, identify potential side effects, and adjust treatment accordingly. This feature of the technology could have a profound impact on cancer care, allowing oncologists to optimize treatment regimens, reduce the risk of side effects, and improve survival rates.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, ChatGPT-generated next-generation sequencing reports have the potential to revolutionize cancer care, providing oncologists with valuable insights into patient-specific genomic data, enabling personalized treatment strategies, and facilitating real-time monitoring of treatment outcomes. Although limitations exist, this technology represents a promising avenue for improving cancer treatment and outcomes.</p>
