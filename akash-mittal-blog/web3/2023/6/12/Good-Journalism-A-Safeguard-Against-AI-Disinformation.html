   <p>How Dietram Scheufele believes Good Journalism can safeguard against AI disinformation</p>

  <main>
   <p>It's no secret that artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming our world. From chatbots to deep learning algorithms, AI and its various forms are becoming increasingly prevalent in our everyday lives.</p>
   <p>But with this rapid growth comes a danger: the potential for AI disinformation. As Dietram Scheufele, a professor at the University of Wisconsin, points out, "AI and other forms of automation can be used to spread disinformation at a speed and scale that was once unimaginable."</p>
   <p>So how can we protect ourselves from AI disinformation? Scheufele believes the answer lies in good journalism. Here's why:</p>
   <h2>A story of AI disinformation</h2>
   <p>Imagine for a moment that you're scrolling through your Facebook feed and you come across a news story that catches your eye. Maybe it's an article claiming that a leading politician is involved in a scandal, or that a new study has found a cure for cancer. Whatever it is, it seems too good to be true.</p>
   <p>And in all likelihood, it is. Because what you don't know is that the article was generated by an AI algorithm designed to spread disinformation and sow chaos. The story itself might be based on a kernel of truth, but it's been spun in a way that's designed to provoke a reaction.</p>
   <p>This kind of scenario is becoming increasingly common in our digital landscape. AI bots and algorithms can generate news stories, social media posts, and even video content that's designed to manipulate and deceive.</p>
   <h2>The importance of good journalism</h2>
   <p>So how do we protect against this kind of disinformation? Scheufele believes that the answer lies in good journalism. When journalists do their job well—fact-checking, sourcing multiple perspectives, and providing context—readers are better equipped to distinguish between fact and fiction.</p>
   <p>For example, let's say that our hypothetical news story from earlier was instead written by a reputable journalist. The journalist would have already done the legwork of checking sources, verifying information, and providing context. You, as the reader, would be more likely to trust the story and take it at face value.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, good journalism can also help to raise awareness about the dangers of AI disinformation. Investigative journalism can uncover the ways in which disinformation is being spread and who's behind it. Opinion journalism can provide thoughtful analysis of why disinformation is so damaging to our society.</p>
   <h2>The future of journalism and AI</h2>
   <p>Of course, there's no denying that AI is already disrupting the world of journalism. Automated news aggregators, for example, are already used by many news organizations to generate articles with minimal human input. And as AI technology improves, it's likely that we'll see more and more AI-generated content in our news feeds.</p>
   <p>But rather than seeing AI as a threat to good journalism, we should instead view it as a tool. By using AI to assist in tasks like fact-checking and data analysis, journalists may be able to work even more efficiently and effectively than before. Some news organizations are already experimenting with AI-powered newsrooms, where machines help reporters find and verify information.</p>
   <p>And as Scheufele points out, the ultimate goal of good journalism should be to help us make sense of the world around us. By working in partnership with AI, journalists may be able to do this more effectively than ever before.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>AI disinformation is a growing threat, but it's one that we can protect ourselves against. By supporting and promoting good journalism, we can ensure that we're better equipped to distinguish between fact and fiction. And by working in partnership with AI, journalists may be able to create a more informed and engaged citizenry.</p>
