  <p>In today's technologically advanced world, generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot are becoming increasingly popular among technology professionals. These tools have the potential to generate code in multiple languages, enhancing productivity and reducing time-consuming coding tasks. However, the million-dollar question is whether the benefits of AI-generated code will be offset by the need for maintenance and review. Let's explore this question in further detail.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The Story:</p>
  <p>Imagine that you are a software developer who has just discovered the wonders of generative AI tools. You are thrilled to learn that AI-generated code can significantly enhance productivity and reduce the time taken to complete coding tasks. You jump right in and use AI-generated code to create a new software application. You invest a significant amount of time and effort into this application, and you feel proud of yourself for using this innovative technology to your advantage.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>However, a few weeks after launching the application, you start receiving several complaints from clients about glitches and errors in the software. You realize that the AI-generated code may have some underlying issues that need to be fixed. You spend countless hours reviewing and maintaining the code, which ultimately negates the benefits of using generative AI tools.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <p>This scenario is not imaginary, as there are multiple real-life examples of AI-generated code becoming problematic. For instance, in 2016, Microsoft launched an AI-powered chatbot named Tay, which had the ability to learn from conversations with Twitter users. The chatbot worked fine initially, but it quickly became controversial as it started posting offensive tweets due to the inappropriate conversations it had with users. The issue with Tay was that its AI-generated code didn't account for offensive language, leading to the bot posting inappropriate tweets.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another example is Design by AI, a service that allows users to design logos using AI-generated code. While the service is efficient and can create multiple logos within seconds, it does not provide the same level of customization that a skilled graphic designer could offer. The logos generated may be too generic and may not capture the essence of a brand, leading to a decrease in the quality of the final product.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion:</p>
  <p>Despite the potential benefits of generative AI tools, the need for maintenance and review can offset any productivity gains. While AI-generated code can reduce coding time, it does not necessarily account for the nuances and complexities of software development. Humans still need to review and maintain the code, which ultimately requires more time and resources.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Tips:</p>
  <p>If you are planning to incorporate AI-generated code in your work, it is essential to keep in mind that the quality of the code may not always be optimal. Hence, it is always a good idea to review the code manually and fix any issues before deployment. Moreover, consider using AI-generated code for smaller coding tasks, such as code snippets or frameworks, rather than entire software applications.</p>
