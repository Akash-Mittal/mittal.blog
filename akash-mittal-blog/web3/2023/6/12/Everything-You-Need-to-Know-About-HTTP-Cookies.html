     <h2>What Are HTTP Cookies?</h2>
     <p>HTTP cookies (also known as web cookies, browser cookies, or internet cookies) are small text files that are stored on your device (e.g. computer, smartphone) by websites that you visit. They are designed to remember your preferences, login information, and browsing history so that the website can provide you with personalized content and services.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="how-do-http-cookies-work">
     <h2>How Do HTTP Cookies Work?</h2>
     <p>When you visit a website, the site sends a request to your device for a cookie file to be stored. The cookie file is then created and saved on your device's hard drive. The website can then read and access the cookie file the next time you visit the site.</p>
     <p>HTTP cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies. Session cookies are stored temporarily and are deleted when you close your browser. Persistent cookies, on the other hand, remain on your device even after you close your browser. They have an expiration date and are deleted after that date.</p>
