    <h2>A Story</h2>
    <p>When I first heard about Sam Altman's remarks on India's attempt to create an AI tool like ChatGPT, I was shocked. As an AI enthusiast myself, I couldn't understand why he would call it 'hopeless'. I decided to do some research and find out what he really meant.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>After reading several articles and watching interviews, I realized that Sam Altman's remarks were taken out of context. He never intended to say that India's attempt was hopeless, but rather that it would be a challenging endeavour. He also stated that replicating ChatGPT would be almost impossible to challenge OpenAI, which is a valid point.</p>
    <p>Altman further clarified that he was impressed with the progress India has made in the field of AI and that he believes there is great potential for innovation in the country. However, creating an AI tool like ChatGPT requires extensive resources, time, and talent.</p>

    <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
    <p>I spoke with a friend who is an AI researcher in India, and he shared his experience of working on similar projects. He mentioned that there is a lack of funding for AI research and development in the country, which makes it difficult for researchers to compete with global counterparts. But he also highlighted the immense talent and innovative ideas that exist in the Indian AI community.</p>
    <p>Another case study I came across was that of Mahira*, a young AI enthusiast from India. She started learning about AI at the age of 14 and has since created several AI-powered tools that have gained recognition in international competitions. Her story is a testament to the fact that there is great potential for innovation in AI in India.</p>
