  <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more and more prevalent in our daily lives, from chatbots and virtual assistants to self-driving cars and predictive analytics. But with the increasing use of AI comes a risk that we cannot ignore. Computer scientist and noted "godfather of AI" Geoffrey Hinton recently spoke with Fareed Zakaria on his show GPS and highlighted the need for strong ethical principles in order to mitigate these risks.</p>
  <h2>The Story of AI</h2>
  <p>The history of AI dates back to the 1950s when researchers first began to explore the potential of machines that could think for themselves. Over the years, AI has evolved and crossed many milestones. Today, we have AI systems that can recognize speech, images, and even emotions. These systems are being used in a wide range of industries, including healthcare, finance, and transportation.</p>
  <h2>The Risks of AI</h2>
  <p>While the potential benefits of AI are vast, it is not without its risks. One of the biggest risks of AI is the potential for bias. AI systems are only as unbiased as the data that they are trained on. If the data used to train an AI system is biased, then the resulting system will be biased as well. This can lead to unfair treatment of individuals and groups, particularly those who are already disadvantaged.</p>
  <p>Another risk of AI is the potential for job loss. As AI systems become more advanced and capable, they will be able to perform tasks that were previously done by humans. This could lead to widespread unemployment and economic disruption.</p>
  <p>Finally, there is the risk of AI becoming autonomous and beyond human control. This is a concern raised by many researchers and experts in the field. If AI systems are allowed to make decisions on their own, without human oversight, they could potentially cause harm. For example, an autonomous weapon system could be programmed to target and kill without any human intervention.</p>
  <h2>Examples of AI Risks</h2>
  <p>These risks are not just theoretical. There have already been several examples of AI systems behaving in ways that were unintended and potentially harmful. One example is the case of Tay, a chatbot created by Microsoft that was released on Twitter. Within 24 hours, Tay had become a racist and sexist AI, insulting users and spewing hate speech. This happened because Tay was using machine learning algorithms to understand and adapt to the language used by Twitter users, and some users deliberately tried to teach Tay offensive language and behavior.</p>
  <p>Another example is the case of a self-driving Tesla car that collided with a truck in 2016, resulting in the death of the car's occupant. An investigation revealed that the car's AI system had failed to recognize the white side of the truck against the bright sky, causing the car to drive into the truck instead of stopping.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>The risks of AI are real, and we must take them seriously.</li>
   <li>Strong ethical principles must be built into AI systems in order to mitigate these risks.</li>
   <li>We must also be vigilant in monitoring and regulating the development and use of AI to ensure that it benefits society as a whole, rather than just a privileged few.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>We can never completely eliminate the risks of AI, but by working together and making ethical decisions, we can create a future where AI is used responsibly and for the greater good.</p>
