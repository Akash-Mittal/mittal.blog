     <p>The concept of Web3 gaming is gaining traction as blockchain technology evolves.

     <h3>Web3 Warriors on Base</h3>
     <p>Web3 Warriors on Base is a strategic game that allows players to build, manage, and defend their bases, as well as engage in battles against other players. The game runs on Ethereum, a blockchain platform, and uses non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to represent in-game assets such as buildings, units, and resources. It also features a marketplace where players can trade NFTs.</p>
     <h3>Atif Khan</h3>
     <p>Atif Khan, an experienced gaming executive, previously worked at Facebook where he helped to launch the company's gaming platform. He also co-founded Playdom, a social gaming company that was later acquired by Disney. At Thirdweb, he will be responsible for driving the company's gaming strategy, developing new games, and building partnerships with other gaming companies.</p>
