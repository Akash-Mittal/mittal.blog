   <h2>The National Intelligence Service (NIS) takes steps to mitigate potential risks of AI chatbots</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>The National Intelligence Service (NIS), Korea's chief spy agency announced on Sunday that it is working on creating security guidelines for how to use ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots. The move comes amid growing concerns over the new technology, as the NIS plans to release its guidelines to government departments and agencies later this month. The NIS has been working on the project since April, in cooperation with experts in the field, to take advantage of AI technology while minimizing possible complications.</p>
   <h3>Why Guidelines are Essential?</h3>
   <p>Artificial Intelligence is rapidly developing technology which has brought tremendous positive impacts but also poses potential risks. In recent years, chatbots have gained immense popularity due to their ease of handling and the convenience they offer in solving complex problems. However, it is crucial to ensure that these chatbots are used ethically and securely.</p>
   <p>Many organizations have faced cyber-attacks and data breaching in the recent past due to negligence or lack of security measures. Even a small vulnerability in the AI chatbots can pose a significant risk to the entire organization as the chatbot learns and communicates with the users. Therefore, it is essential to have clear guidelines that will help users to understand how to operate a chatbot safely, minimizing possible risks, and avoid any potential complications.</p>
   <h3>Illustration of Guidelines</h3>
   <p>Let's say you're an employee of a software firm and your company has recently deployed an AI chatbot to handle the customer's queries. Here are some of the guidelines that you should follow to use the chatbot:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Do not input any sensitive data such as bank account numbers, social security numbers, or login credentials to the chatbot.</li>
    <li>Do not communicate any sensitive company data through the chatbot.</li>
    <li>Do not share any confidential information with any third-party providers.</li>
    <li>Report any suspicious behavior or messages to the Security team.</li>
    <li>Ensure the chatbot is regularly updated with the latest security patches provided by the vendor.</li>
    <li>Ensure the chatbot has a secure communication channel with users.</li>
   </ol>
   <h3>Real-Life Example of Chatbot Breach</h3>
   <p>Example of a data breach through chatbot is the matter of concern for the users. In 2017, a chatbot installed on the website of popular travel booking site Expedia was breached. This data breach exposed sensitive information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, and other travel-related data of thousands of customers.</p>
   <p>Similarly, in 2020, a cybercriminal compromised the database of a popular gambling mobile app, breached messages from the chatbot, and leaked them online. This breach caused huge financial losses and reputational damage to the company. Hence, it is necessary to take measures to secure the chatbots, and for that, security guidelines are the first step.</p>
