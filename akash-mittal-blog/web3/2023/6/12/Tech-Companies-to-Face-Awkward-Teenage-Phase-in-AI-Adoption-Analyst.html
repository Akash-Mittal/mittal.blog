  <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a buzzword in the tech industry for quite some time now, with many companies investing heavily in the technology to revolutionize different aspects of their business. However, according to Jefferies Senior Analyst Brent Thill, such companies are yet to face an "awkward teenage phase" in AI adoption.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In an interview with Yahoo Finance Live, Thill shared his insights on how the AI hype will play out in the coming years, how companies are struggling to find the right balance between human and machine, and how AI is likely to disrupt jobs and society as a whole.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>He pointed out that while AI technology has made significant progress in recent years, there are still many challenges that companies need to overcome in terms of data privacy, ethics, and cybersecurity. Moreover, there is a general lack of understanding of how AI works and how it can be integrated into different businesses.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>To illustrate his point, Thill gave an example of how medical professionals are hesitant to integrate AI into their work due to the fear of losing their jobs. "Doctors aren't going to embrace AI until they are confident they can trust it," he said.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Thill also emphasized the importance of finding the right balance between human and machine in the workplace. "So much of this is about augmenting human intelligence, not replacing it," he said. "That's where you get to the productivity gains, and that's where you get to the innovation."</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>However, Thill believes that the adoption of AI will likely disrupt jobs and society, and companies need to prepare for this. "We could see a significant impact, but we don't know how significant," he said. "It's going to be incumbent upon companies to think through the ramifications."</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, Thill emphasized that companies need to be aware of the challenges and limitations of AI and not get caught up in the hype. "We're still in the early innings of AI," he said. "And there's going to be this awkward teenage phase where companies try to figure out who they are, what their process is, and how they integrate AI into that process."</p>

  <p>Personal Anecdote:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>I remember participating in a hackathon where we developed an AI-powered chatbot for a company's customer service. We thought we had created something groundbreaking, but when we tested the chatbot with real customers, things went south quickly. The chatbot couldn't understand the nuances of human language, and customers got frustrated with the generic responses. It was a stark reminder that AI is not a magic solution and that companies need to be mindful of its limitations.</p>
