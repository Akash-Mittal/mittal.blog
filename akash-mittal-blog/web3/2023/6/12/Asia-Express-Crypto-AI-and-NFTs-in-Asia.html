    <h2>The Rise of Crypto, AI, and NFTs in Asia</h2>
    <p>Asia is at the forefront of the latest tech trends, from cryptocurrencies to artificial intelligence to non-fungible tokens. In particular, Hong Kong is seeing a surge in demand for crypto workers, with a need for 100,000 professionals in the industry. Meanwhile, AliExpress' NFT drop was recently censored, and Binance suffered humiliation on Chinese television. On the other hand, an AI unicorn has emerged in just 100 days. Let's take a closer look at these developments.</p>

   <section id="examples">
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <h3>Hong Kong Needs Crypto Experts</h3>
    <p>Hong Kong has always been a hub of financial innovation and creativity, with a deep understanding of the global economy. Now, the city is recognizing the importance of crypto in its future, and is calling for 100,000 crypto workers to establish a stable and sustainable industry. This includes not only developers and engineers, but also customer service representatives, marketing professionals, and legal experts. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is also working closely with other regulatory agencies to establish a framework for the industry.</p>
    <h3>AliExpress NFT Drop Censored</h3>
    <p>AliExpress, one of China's largest e-commerce platforms, recently tried to launch an NFT drop, featuring celebrity portraits and other digital art. However, the company received backlash from China's regulators, who view NFTs as a potential threat to social stability and financial security. The NFTs were pulled from the platform, and AliExpress issued a statement saying it would comply with all relevant laws and regulations.</p>
    <h3>Binance Humiliated on China TV</h3>
    <p>Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, was recently featured in a Chinese TV program that criticized the company's business practices and questioned its legitimacy. The program alleged that Binance was involved in money laundering and other illegal activities, and called for stricter government regulation of the industry. Binance responded by saying that it would cooperate with regulators and work to improve transparency and compliance.</p>
    <h3>AI Unicorn Grows in 100 Days</h3>
    <p>In the midst of all these developments, one company stands out as a beacon of hope. A Chinese AI start-up called Horizon Robotics recently became a unicorn (a company valued at over $1 billion) just 100 days after its latest funding round. The company specializes in AI chips and software, and has partnerships with major firms like SK Telecom and Audi. The success of Horizon Robotics shows that there is still plenty of potential for growth and innovation in Asia's tech industry.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Asia is rapidly becoming a hotbed of technological innovation, and crypto, AI, and NFTs are just a few examples of this trend. While there are still challenges and obstacles to overcome, such as government regulation and public perception, there is also huge potential for growth and development. As the world becomes increasingly digital and interconnected, Asia's tech industry is poised to play a leading role in shaping the future. We encourage young and ambitious individuals to explore this sector, and take advantage of the opportunities that it presents.</p>
