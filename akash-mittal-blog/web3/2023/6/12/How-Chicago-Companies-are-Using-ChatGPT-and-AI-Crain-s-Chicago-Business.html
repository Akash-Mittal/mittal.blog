   <h3>The Story</h3>
   <p>As technology continues to advance, businesses in Chicago are looking for ways to leverage it to increase efficiency and improve customer experience. In recent months, a growing number of local companies have begun experimenting with ChatGPT and its artificial-intelligence siblings, with some early successes.</p>
   <h3>Examples</h3>
   <p>One of the first Chicago companies to embrace ChatGPT was United Airlines, which launched its "Agent on Demand" program in August 2019. This virtual assistant allows customers to get quick answers to their questions through Facebook Messenger, and can even complete simple tasks like rebooking a flight.</p>
   <p>Another Chicago-based business that has begun utilizing ChatGPT is financial services firm Morningstar. The company's AI-powered chatbot, named "Holly," helps clients find investment advice and stay up to date on market news. Since Holly's launch in March 2020, Morningstar has seen a significant increase in engagement on its platform.</p>
   <h3>Conclusion</h3>
   <p>While these are just two examples, they demonstrate the potential benefits of using ChatGPT and AI in business. By deploying virtual assistants like Agent on Demand and Holly, companies can provide faster and more efficient customer service, freeing up time for human agents to tackle more complex issues. Additionally, AI-powered chatbots can help businesses mine data on customer behavior and preferences, providing valuable insights that can inform future decisions.</p>
   <h3>Tips</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Before implementing a chatbot or virtual assistant, make sure you have a clear understanding of your customers' needs and pain points.</li>
    <li>Ensure that your chatbot is equipped to handle a variety of questions and scenarios, and can escalate issues to a human agent when necessary.</li>
    <li>Regularly monitor and analyze chatbot data to identify opportunities for improvement and refine your strategy.</li>
   </ul>
