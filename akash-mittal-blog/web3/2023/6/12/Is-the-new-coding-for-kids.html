  <p>Recently, there has been increasing interest in teaching children how to code. This has been fuelled by a belief that coding skills will be essential for future employment in an increasingly technology-driven world. However, there is a new trend emerging - AI prompting. Some experts believe that learning how to prompt an AI engine is the new coding for kids. But is this really the case?</p>
  <h2>A personal story</h2>
  <p>My own interest in coding began when I was just eight years old. My father, who was a software engineer, encouraged me to code simple programs using Microsoft Basic. I loved it and knew that I wanted to pursue a career in technology.</p>
  <p>However, times have changed since then. Today's children are growing up in a world where artificial intelligence is becoming more and more prevalent. It's no longer enough to simply code - we need to teach children how to interact with AI, to prompt it and to shape it.</p>
  <h2>Examples of AI prompting</h2>
  <p>So what exactly is AI prompting? Put simply, it is the process of instructing an AI engine to perform a certain task. This could be anything from creating a chatbot to developing a facial recognition system.</p>
  <p>One example of AI prompting is Google's Teachable Machine. This web-based tool enables users to train an AI engine to recognize different objects or actions. For example, you could teach it to recognize a specific type of fruit or to identify when someone is walking.</p>
  <p>Another example is Scratch, a visual programming language developed by MIT. Scratch enables children to create interactive stories, games, and animations, while also introducing basic concepts of coding and AI.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>So, is AI prompting the new coding for kids? In my opinion, it certainly has a place alongside traditional coding training. AI prompting is likely to become increasingly important in the future, as more and more jobs involve working with AI systems. It's a life skill that could potentially provide many opportunities for those who have mastered it.</p>
  <p>That said, we shouldn't forget the importance of traditional coding skills. Coding provides a foundation for learning about technology and for creating new innovations. Children should be encouraged to explore both coding and AI prompting, so that they have a well-rounded understanding of technology and its potential.</p>
  <h2>Tips for parents and educators</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>Encourage children to explore both coding and AI prompting.</li>
   <li>Provide access to tools like Teachable Machine and Scratch.</li>
   <li>Offer guidance and support as children learn new skills.</li>
   <li>Emphasize the importance of creativity and problem-solving.</li>
  </ul>
