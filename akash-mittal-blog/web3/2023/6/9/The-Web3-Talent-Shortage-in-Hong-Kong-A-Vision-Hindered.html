   <h2>Story of a Web3 Startup CEO</h2>
   <p>Lin is the CEO of a Web3 startup based in Hong Kong. Her company offers blockchain-based solutions for supply chain management to manufacturing companies. She's been working in the Web3 industry for the past five years and has seen it grow rapidly. However, Lin is worried about the future of her company and the industry in Hong Kong. There is a glaring talent shortage that is hindering the growth of the Web3 industry in the region.</p>
   <p>Lin's company has been trying to hire more talent to keep up with the growth but has been struggling to find skilled employees. The job descriptions her company posts for software engineers, blockchain developers, and DevOps specialists have garnered very few applications, and those that did apply lacked the required skills.</p>
   <p>Lin can't help but feel frustrated and worried about the future of her company and the industry. She also feels that Hong Kong's government and educational institutions are not doing enough to address the talent shortage and prepare the next generation of employees to fill the skills gap.</p>
   <hr>
   <h2>The Scale of the Talent Shortage</h2>
   <p>Lin is not alone in her concerns. A recent report by the Hong Kong Blockchain Association revealed that the Web3 industry in Hong Kong is facing a 100,000-person shortfall in skilled talent. This gap is set to increase as the industry continues to grow and expand in the region.</p>
   <p>The report highlights that the shortage is not only limited to technical talent, but encompasses a wide range of skills, including business development, marketing, and legal expertise. The lack of talent has led to fierce competition among companies for the few skilled employees available, and this has driven up salaries.</p>
   <p>The report also warns that the lack of skilled talent could lead to a stagnation of the Web3 industry in Hong Kong, as companies are unable to innovate and develop new products and services due to a lack of resources.</p>

   <h2>Addressing the Talent Shortage</h2>
   <p>The talent shortage in Hong Kong's Web3 industry is a significant challenge. To address this issue, the industry needs to take a multi-pronged approach that involves government, educational institutions, companies, and the industry itself.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The government needs to provide support and funding for educational institutions to develop Web3-related courses and training programs that can produce skilled talent.</li>
    <li>Companies need to invest in training programs and upskilling their current employees to fill the skills gap.</li>
    <li>The industry needs to collaborate and share knowledge to create a pool of skilled talent that is available to all companies.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Lin agrees with this approach but believes that companies must take the lead in addressing the talent shortage. She also believes that more can be done to promote the Web3 industry and showcase its potential to attract new talent.</p>
   <p>"The Web3 industry is exciting, innovative and has so much potential," says Lin. "Companies need to do more to promote the industry and showcase its value to attract new talent."</p>
