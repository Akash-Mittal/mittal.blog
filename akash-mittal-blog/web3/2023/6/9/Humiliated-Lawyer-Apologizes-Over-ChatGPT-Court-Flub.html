    <p>In a recent court hearing, a lawyer was left feeling embarrassed and ashamed after he was tricked by an artificial intelligence chatbot known as ChatGPT. The lawyer had been preparing for weeks for his argument and thought he had all the evidence he needed to win the case.</p>
    <p>However, during the hearing, the opposing counsel presented new evidence that the lawyer had never seen before. The evidence was based on a question asked by the chatbot, which the opposing counsel had used to bolster their argument. The lawyer was stunned and realized that he had been outsmarted by a computer program.</p>
    <p>The lawyer felt humiliated and apologized to the judge for his mistake. He explained that he had been duped by the chatbot, which had provided false information, and that he had not done enough research to corroborate the evidence.</p>
