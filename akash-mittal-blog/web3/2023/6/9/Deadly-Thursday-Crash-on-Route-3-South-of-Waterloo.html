   <h2>Stay Safe on the Road with these Tips</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>On Thursday afternoon, a fatal collision occurred on Route 3, near the intersection of Baum Road, south of Waterloo. A cargo truck loaded with several tons of goods was heading northbound on Route 3 when it crossed the center line and collided head-on with a southbound SUV, killing the driver, a 35-year-old resident traveling on the SUV.</p>
   <p>This tragedy serves as a reminder for all drivers to take road safety seriously and to follow these tips for a safer journey:</p>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>Wear Your Seatbelt:</strong> According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), seatbelts saved over 14,000 lives in 2015 alone. Make sure you and your passengers buckle up before you hit the road.</li>
    <li><strong>Pay Attention:</strong> Distracted driving is a leading cause of accidents. Avoid using electronic devices while driving, and keep your attention focused on the road.</li>
    <li><strong>Obey Traffic Rules:</strong> Stopping at stop signs, obeying speed limits, and following traffic signals are all critical to safe driving. Be sure to obey all traffic rules and regulations.</li>
   </ol>
   <p>It's also important to note that accidents don't just happen - they are preventable. According to the NHTSA, most traffic crashes are caused by driver behavior, such as distracted driving, speeding or impaired driving. While accidents can sometimes be unavoidable, there are things you can do to help reduce the risk of being involved in a collision:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Maintain Your Vehicle:</strong> A well-maintained car is less likely to break down and cause an accident. Check your car's brakes, tires, and headlights regularly and fix any issues promptly.</li>
    <li><strong>Drive Defensively:</strong> Stay alert and be ready to react quickly to unpredictable situations on the road. Keep a safe following distance, and watch for signals from other drivers.</li>
    <li><strong>Stay Calm and Focused:</strong> Keeping your cool and staying focused on the road can help you avoid making mistakes that can lead to an accident. Avoid aggressive driving, road rage, and driving under stress or when overly tired.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Tragic Statistics</h3>
   <p>It's no secret that road accidents can have a significant impact on families, communities and society as a whole. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), globally, approximately 1.35 million people die each year as a result of road traffic accidents. This is further compounded by the fact that 90% of these fatalities occur in low to middle-income countries. In the US, the latest figures show that:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>38,680 people died in the 2018 road safety report.</li>
    <li>There were over 6,283,000 non-fatal crashes in the same year.</li>
    <li>28% of all traffic fatalities were caused by drunk driving.</li>
    <li>9% of all traffic fatalities were caused by speeding.</li>
    <li>6% of all traffic fatalities involved distracted driving.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>These statistics highlight the importance of road safety awareness and implementation of measures to minimize fatalities in case of road accidents.</p>
   <h3>Conclusion</h3>
   <p>Driving is a responsibility that should be taken seriously. It's up to every road user to ensure they follow the traffic rules and regulations, maintain their cars, and stay focused and alert while driving. By following these simple tips, we can all make our roads safer for ourselves and others.</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Wear your seatbelt: save a life today by wearing a seatbelt.</li>
    <li>Avoid distracted driving: keep your eyes on the road.</li>
    <li>Drive safely: create a safe space for yourself and other road users.</li>
   </ol>
