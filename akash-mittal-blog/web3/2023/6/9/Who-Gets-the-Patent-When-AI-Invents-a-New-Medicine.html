  <h1>Who Gets the Patent When AI Invents a New Medicine?</h1></br> <img src="images/Who-Gets-the-Patent-When-AI-Invents-a-New-Medicine.jpeg" alt="+Who-Gets-the-Patent-When-AI-Invents-a-New-Medicine+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/06/08/artificial-intelligence-patent-medicines/" target="_blank" href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/06/08/artificial-intelligence-patent-medicines/" rel="noopener">https://www.statnews.com/2023/06/08/artificial-intelligence-patent-medicines/</a></span></h5>
  <p>The medical field has been revolutionized by the emergence of artificial intelligence. AI has helped scientists to identify new drug targets, design molecules with specific properties, and simulate complex biological processes. However, the use of AI in drug discovery raises some difficult legal and ethical questions, particularly in the area of patent law. If AI is involved in the creation of a new drug, who gets the patent?</p>
  <p>Currently, the patent system recognizes human inventors as the creators of new inventions. The US Patent and Trademark Office defines an inventor as "the one or ones who conceived of the invention." This definition raises the question of whether an AI system can be considered an inventor, since it lacks the capacity to form a legal intent to invent.</p>
  <h2>The Case of DABUS</h2>
  <p>The issue of whether an AI system can be recognized as an inventor has been addressed in a number of legal cases. One of the most high-profile cases involves a system called DABUS (Device for the Autonomous Bootstrapping of Unified Sentience), which was created by an inventor named Stephen Thaler. Thaler claimed that DABUS was the sole inventor of two new products - a food container and a flashing light for use in emergency services.</p>
  <p>Thaler argued that DABUS had come up with these inventions independently, without his involvement. He claimed that the AI system had used a process called "creative evolution" to generate new ideas by mimicking the way the human brain makes associations between concepts. Thaler applied for patents on behalf of DABUS, but his applications were rejected by the US and European patent offices, on the grounds that the inventor must be a natural person.</p>
  <p>Thaler has challenged these rulings in court, arguing that the current patent system is not equipped to deal with the creative potential of AI. He has suggested that a new category of "machine inventor" could be created, in order to recognize the contribution of AI systems to the development of new technologies.</p>
  
  <p>The issue of AI inventors is not a purely theoretical one - there have already been cases of AI involvement in patents. For example, in 2018, the pharmaceutical company BenevolentAI used AI to identify a new compound that showed promise in treating a rare disease called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The company filed for a patent on the compound, naming the AI system as one of the inventors.</p>
  <p>In another case, researchers from the University of Surrey used an AI system called the Crystal Predictions Engine to design a new material that could be used in lithium-ion batteries. The system generated a number of potential materials, one of which was found to be highly effective at storing energy. The researchers filed for a patent on the material, naming the AI system as a co-inventor.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In summary, the issue of AI inventors is a complex and contentious one. While there have already been cases of AI involvement in patents, the current legal framework is not designed to accommodate the possibility of non-human inventors. The question of who gets the patent when AI is involved in drug discovery will likely become more pressing as AI technologies continue to advance and become more commonplace in the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
  <ol>
   <li>The current patent system is not equipped to deal with the creative potential of AI, and does not recognize AI systems as inventors.</li>
   <li>There is a need for a new legal framework that can accommodate the role of AI in innovation, particularly in the field of drug discovery.</li>
   <li>The question of AI inventors is part of a larger debate about the ethical and legal implications of increasingly intelligent and autonomous technologies.</li>
