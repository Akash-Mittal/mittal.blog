  <p>It was a rainy night in May 2022 when Babbs, a one-year-old Beagle mix, was left behind by her owners in a deserted alley in Raleigh, North Carolina. Babbs was heavily pregnant and scared; she didn't know where to go or what to do. She cried and barked for help, but no one seemed to hear her.</p>
  <p>Hours passed, and Babbs' contractions started. She gave birth to her first pup alone, in a cardboard box she found under a dumpster. She licked him clean and cuddled him, hoping that he would be safe and warm. But more pups were coming, and Babbs knew that she couldn't take care of them all by herself.</p>
  <p>Days went by, and Babbs and her four puppies - Ben, Beverly, Buster, and Betsy - struggled to survive. They had no food, no water, and no shelter. They were exposed to the elements, the noise, and the dangers of the street. They were hungry, thirsty, and sick.</p>
  <p>But then, fate intervened, and Babbs and her pups were rescued by CrisisDogsNC, a local nonprofit that helps homeless, abandoned, and abused dogs find permanent and loving homes. CrisisDogsNC provided Babbs and her pups with food, water, medical care, and foster homes. They gave them a second chance at life.</p><img src="babbs-and-puppies.jpg" alt="Babbs and her four puppies">
  <p>Today, one year later, Babbs and her pups are thriving. They are happy, healthy, and playful. They have been spayed and neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped. They have learned basic obedience and socialization skills. They have become loving and loyal companions.</p>
  <p>But their journey from abandoned to adored was not easy. They faced many challenges along the way, such as:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Lack of resources: Babbs and her pups had no access to food, water, medical care, or shelter before they were rescued. They were vulnerable to hunger, thirst, disease, and injury.</li>
   <li>Emotional trauma: Babbs and her pups were abandoned, which caused them fear, anxiety, and stress. They had to adjust to new environments, people, and routines, which was confusing and overwhelming.</li>
   <li>Behavioral issues: Babbs and her pups had no training or guidance before they were rescued. They had to learn how to behave in a household, such as using the bathroom outside, respecting boundaries, and interacting with humans and other animals appropriately.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>However, thanks to the dedication and commitment of CrisisDogsNC and their volunteers, Babbs and her pups overcame these challenges and found loving homes. They also inspire others to adopt and rescue dogs in need.</p>
  <blockquote>
   "Babbs and her puppies are a testament to the resilience and perseverance of dogs and the power of compassion and kindness," says Lisa Johnson, the founder of CrisisDogsNC. "They remind us that every dog deserves a chance to live a happy and healthy life."
