   <p>Imagine that you're starting a new business, and you're in the process of hiring a team of employees. It's an exciting time, and you're eager to get started with the hiring process. However, before you can start making job offers, you need to create employment contracts for each of your new hires. This can be a time-consuming and complicated process - but with DocuSign, it doesn't have to be.</p>
   <p>DocuSign is a popular electronic signature and contract management platform that helps businesses of all sizes create, sign, and manage legally binding documents. It's a fast, efficient, and secure way to handle contracts, agreements, and other important legal documents.

   <h2 class="section-title">The Power of AI in Contract Management</h2>
   <p>One of the most exciting applications of AI in the business world is in contract management. Using machine learning algorithms and natural language processing technology, AI-powered contract management platforms can analyze contracts and other legal documents to identify important clauses, provisions, and terms. This can help businesses more quickly and accurately create, negotiate, and manage contracts.</p>
   <p>DocuSign has already started to integrate AI technology into its platform. In 2018, the company acquired Seal Software, a company that specializes in AI-powered contract analysis. DocuSign has also developed its own AI-powered system, called DocuSign Intelligent Insights, which helps users analyze contracts and other legal documents to identify key terms and conditions.</p>
   <p>These AI-powered features can save businesses time and money, while also improving the accuracy and quality of their contracts. For example, a company using DocuSign Intelligent Insights might be able to quickly identify clauses in a contract that could create potential legal liabilities, allowing them to negotiate better terms and conditions with their contracting partners.</p>

And DocuSign is well-positioned to capture a significant portion of that market.</p>
