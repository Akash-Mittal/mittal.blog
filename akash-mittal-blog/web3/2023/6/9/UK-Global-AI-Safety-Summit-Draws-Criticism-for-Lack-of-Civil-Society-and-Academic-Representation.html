  <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a growing topic around the globe, and the United Kingdom has not been left behind. The country has been making significant strides in developing and regulating AI to ensure its safety and responsible use in society. The UK government recently announced plans to hold a global AI safety summit. However, the announcement has received criticisms for lacking representation from civil society and academia.</p>
  <h2>No Room For Civil Society and Academic Voices</h2>
  <p>The UK government sponsored AI safety summit, slated for June 2021, is planned to bring together experts in the field of AI from around the world to discuss and develop new strategies. The meeting will be held virtually to accommodate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. According to the announcement, the summit's aim is to "drive progress towards ensuring the safe and ethical development and deployment of AI."</p>
  <p>Despite the summit's laudable goal, some critics have chastised the UK government's lack of representation for civil society and academic voices within the planning and development of the summit. According to the criticisms, the UK government's approach emphasizes the need for government and industry voices and excludes academic researchers or anyone weighing in from the public perspective.</p>
  <h2>The Need for a Diverse Representation</h2>
  <p>The lack of representation for civil society and academia voices is a crucial weakness in the UK government's effort to shape AI's development and regulation. The reason for this is straightforward; AI's impact on society goes beyond commercial or governmental interests. It has the potential to impact virtually everyone, and everyone should have a voice in its development, regulation, and use. AI raises ethical, social, and legal issues that require an interdisciplinary approach. Disciplinary perspectives should be considered from the most varied fields as possible, including philosophy, law, social sciences, and humanities.</p>
  <p>Without a diverse representation of voices at the table, the potential impacts of AI on society will be unrepresentative and insufficiently rigorous. The UK government's announcement does not include "a single voice from civil society or academia," said critics. The criticism from civil society on the lack of representation for AI is not exclusive to the UK but has been raised globally. In a report published by the World Economic Forum, it was highlighted that AI regulation is primarily influenced by technology companies and governments, leaving a vacuum for the perspectives of civil society and academia.</p>
  <h2>The Importance of Collaboration in AI Development and Regulation</h2>
  <p>Collaboration is key in developing new technologies, AI inclusive, and ensuring they reflect the values and interests of society. The UK government has shown a willingness to work with the private and academic sectors on AI, and this dialogue must continue. The criticism on representation illustrates the need for more diversity and conversations at the heart of AI policy-making. One of the strengths of engagement is that it extends beyond closed networks to include various disciplinary perspectives.</p>
  <p>While the UK government's initiative to hold an AI safety summit signals a commitment to AI safety and regulation, the lack of representation for civil society and academia limits the likelihood of successful collaboration. Civil society organizations have the potential to incorporate diverse and inclusive perspectives into policymaking, focused on enhancing social good. Academia has the potential to offer a balanced and evidence-based perspective on AI.</p>
  <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The UK government's initiative to hold a global AI safety summit that brings together experts in AI safety and regulation is a great step. However, the exclusion of civil society and academia is a weakness, and it must be addressed. A significant and broad impact of AI requires an interdisciplinary approach that engages more civil society organizations and academic researchers offering deeper perspectives and criticisms of AI. Collaboration should be inclusive of government, industry, civil society, and academia. Thus, the UK government, alongside private enterprises and academia, needs to work on mechanisms to encourage the incorporation of more diverse perspectives into AI policymaking.</p>
