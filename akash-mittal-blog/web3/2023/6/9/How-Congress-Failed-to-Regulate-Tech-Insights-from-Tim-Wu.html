   <p>Imagine using a social media app to connect with your friends and family, only to find out that your personal data has been harvested and sold to third-party companies without your consent. Or, imagine browsing the internet and being bombarded with targeted ads that seem to know everything about you, including your deepest desires and fears. These are just some of the consequences of the rapid and unchecked growth of tech companies in recent years, which have left many Americans feeling vulnerable and powerless.</p>
   <p>However, Congress had the chance to regulate tech and protect consumers from its harms, but it failed to do so. According to Tim Wu, a former adviser to President Joe Biden, lawmakers were too busy fighting among themselves to pass any meaningful legislation that would hold tech companies accountable for their actions.</p>
   <h2>The Missed Opportunity</h2>
   <p>During the Obama administration, Congress had several opportunities to regulate tech companies and protect consumer privacy. For instance, in 2012, the Federal Trade Commission issued a scathing report that accused Google of using anti-competitive tactics to dominate the online advertising market. However, the agency failed to take any real action against Google, and Congress did not intervene.</p>
   <p>Similarly, in 2016, the Obama administration proposed a set of privacy rules that would have given consumers more control over their personal data and required tech companies to obtain customers' consent before sharing their information with third-party advertisers. However, Republicans in Congress opposed the rules and passed legislation to overturn them, effectively killing any chance of regulating tech companies during the Obama years.</p>
   <h2>Why Congress Failed to Act</h2>
   <p>According to Tim Wu, the former Biden aide, Congress failed to regulate tech because lawmakers were too consumed by partisan politics and were more interested in protecting their own interests than those of the American people. He argues that Democrats were beholden to Silicon Valley donors and were reluctant to criticize tech companies, while Republicans saw tech companies as valuable allies in their fight against regulation.</p>
   <h2>The Consequences of Inaction</h2>
   <p>The consequences of Congress's failure to regulate tech are clear. Tech companies continue to collect huge amounts of personal data from consumers without their consent and use it to exploit their behavior for financial gain. This has led to a host of problems, including the proliferation of fake news, the erosion of privacy, and the spread of hate speech and harassment online.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, Congress failed to regulate tech during the Obama years because it was too busy fighting among itself and was more interested in protecting its own interests than those of the American people. The consequences of this inaction are clear, as tech companies continue to hold vast amounts of personal data and exploit it for financial gain. If we want to protect consumer privacy and ensure that tech companies are held accountable for their actions, we need a new approach to regulation that is based on transparency, accountability, and consumer empowerment.</p>
