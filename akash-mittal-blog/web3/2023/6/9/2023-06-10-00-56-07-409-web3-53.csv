2023-06-10 11:20 PM;,"Recently, some images of Satanic clothes supposedly sold at Target started circulating on social media. The images showed shirts and hoodies with demonic symbols and phrases like ""Hail Satan"" and ""Satanic Panic"". Many people were outraged and called for a boycott of Target, accusing the retailer of promoting Satanism and going against Christian values.
However, a fact check by USA TODAY revealed that the images were not real. Target confirmed that it never sold such merchandise, and the person who created the images admitted that they were generated using artificial intelligence.
This incident shows how easily false information can spread on social media, causing public outrage and damaging the reputation of businesses and individuals. It also highlights the potential of AI to create realistic-looking images and videos that can deceive people.
According to a survey by Pew Research Center, 62% of Americans get their news from social media. This means that false information on social media can reach a large audience quickly and easily.
Another study by Stanford University found that people have a hard time distinguishing between real and fake news, especially when it confirms their preexisting beliefs. This cognitive bias can make them more susceptible to misinformation and conspiracy theories.

2023-06-11 12:20 AM;,"As a miner, have you ever wondered why the reward for successfully mining a bitcoin block keeps getting cut in half every four years? This phenomenon is called halving, and it is programmed into the Bitcoin protocol to control inflation. In simpler terms, it means that the amount of bitcoins that miners can earn per block mined reduces by half, after every 210,000 blocks until all 21 million bitcoins are mined. The last halving event occurred in 2020 and the next one is expected in 2024. In this article, we will explore what Bitcoin's 2024 halving means for miners and provide some tips on how to survive it.
The story of Bitcoin halving dates back to its inception in 2009 when its founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, introduced it as part of its protocol. The idea behind halving is to ensure that the supply of bitcoins is limited and controlled, just like gold. By halving the rewards, the protocol slows down the rate at which new bitcoins are mined, and hence, prevents inflation. Moreover, it also increases the value of bitcoin, as the supply becomes scarce.
Bitcoin halving events have occurred twice before, and the next one is expected to take place in 2024. During the first halving in 2012, the reward for mining a block dropped from 50 bitcoins to 25 bitcoins. In the second halving in 2016, the reward reduced further to 12.5 bitcoins. In 2024, the reward will be reduced to 6.25 bitcoins.
The halving of the block rewards will have a significant impact on miners, especially those who rely heavily on mining for profitability. To illustrate this, let's take a look at some quantifiable examples of what the 2024 halving event could mean for miners:
Now that we know what the 2024 halving could mean for miners, let's explore some tips on how to survive it:

Every day, new AI technologies are developed, and with their development comes many complex issues that need to be addressed. One of these issues is the regulation and compliance standards of AI-based tools.
In response to the need for regulation and compliance standards in AI-based tools, two US lawmakers have introduced AI-related bills in Congress. These bills aim to establish regulatory standards and compliance guidelines for the use of AI-based tools in the US.
The first bill, the Algorithmic Accountability Act, aims to address the potential bias and discrimination that may arise from the use of automated decision-making algorithms. The bill requires companies to conduct impact assessments of their algorithms' potential bias and implement measures to minimize that bias.
The second bill, the National AI Research Resource Task Force Act, aims to establish a task force to develop a national research cloud for AI. The bill proposes the creation of a task force with representatives from industry, academia, and government to develop a roadmap for the research cloud, including its technical requirements, governance structures, and funding options.
The introduction of these two AI-related bills marks an important step towards regulating the use of AI-based tools in the US. The bills address the potential biases and ethical considerations of AI, while also promoting the development of new and innovative technologies.

2023-06-11 02:00 AM;,"Have you ever heard of AI prompt engineering? Probably not, but this is a job that is quickly becoming one of the hottest and highest paying jobs out there. In fact, some companies are paying six figures to experts in this field. Let's explore what AI prompt engineering is and why it is in such high demand.
AI prompt engineering is a new job title that has emerged in the realm of artificial intelligence (AI). Essentially, an AI prompt engineer is responsible for creating prompts that will be used to train machine learning models. This is a critical aspect of AI development because the accuracy of the models is dependent on the quality of the prompts used to train them.
For example, if you were developing an AI model to differentiate between cats and dogs, you would need to provide the machine with thousands of images of both cats and dogs and properly labeled and categorized. The AI prompt engineer would be responsible for designing these prompts and providing the correct data sets to train the machine learning model.
Perhaps the best way to understand the importance of AI prompt engineering is to look at some examples. Here are a few real-world examples of how AI prompt engineering is already being used:
These are just a few examples, but the truth is that AI prompt engineering has applications in almost every industry, from healthcare to transportation to education.

2023-06-11 02:00 AM;,"Have you ever heard of AI prompt engineering? Probably not, but this is a job that is quickly becoming one of the hottest and highest paying jobs out there. In fact, some companies are paying six figures to experts in this field. Let's explore what AI prompt engineering is and why it is in such high demand.
AI prompt engineering is a new job title that has emerged in the realm of artificial intelligence (AI). Essentially, an AI prompt engineer is responsible for creating prompts that will be used to train machine learning models. This is a critical aspect of AI development because the accuracy of the models is dependent on the quality of the prompts used to train them.
For example, if you were developing an AI model to differentiate between cats and dogs, you would need to provide the machine with thousands of images of both cats and dogs and properly labeled and categorized. The AI prompt engineer would be responsible for designing these prompts and providing the correct data sets to train the machine learning model.
Perhaps the best way to understand the importance of AI prompt engineering is to look at some examples. Here are a few real-world examples of how AI prompt engineering is already being used:
These are just a few examples, but the truth is that AI prompt engineering has applications in almost every industry, from healthcare to transportation to education.

You immediately panic since you have been using your account to pay for your daily expenses and bills, and you have no idea why your account got flagged.
You try to reach out to the provider's customer service, but you keep hearing that they cannot discuss the specific details of your case due to privacy and regulatory restrictions. You feel helpless, frustrated, and violated.
According to a study conducted by Chainalysis, a blockchain analytics firm, the number of cryptocurrency-related crimes in 2020 was around 300,000, with a total value of $10 billion.
Furthermore, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) reported that in the first half of 2021, the number of suspicious activity reports (SARs) related to virtual currencies reached a record high of 65,000, a 44% increase from the previous year.

Well, that's what happened to Deadpool fans when Rob Liefield, the creator of the comic book character, shared a curious photo from the set of Deadpool 3 on his Twitter account.
The photo featured an obscure door with the number ""3"" on it, fueling speculation that it was a teaser for the upcoming film. Fans began to speculate about what the door could represent, ranging from the third installment of the Deadpool franchise to a possible crossover with the Fantastic Four.
As the chatter grew louder, Liefield decided to shed some light on the mystery behind the photo. In an interview with Collider, he revealed that the door had no significant meaning at all and that the tweet was nothing more than a lighthearted joke.
""I literally took a picture in the parking lot, and I walked by and I saw the number 3 on the door,"" Liefield stated. ""And I was like, 'Oh, that would be funny if I tweeted something about Deadpool 3."" As a result, the Twitterverse was sent on a wild goose chase over a door that had no significance to the film whatsoever.

2023-06-11 03:00 AM;,"Imagine that you are a Florida radio host, and one day you find yourself being accused of making false statements by a controversial AI made by OpenAI, ChatGPT. The AI generated content that claimed you made racist comments on air, and your reputation suffers as a result. This is precisely the situation that the plaintiff in a recent defamation lawsuit against OpenAI, accused of releasing false statements about a radio host, finds themselves in.
The plaintiff, who wishes to remain anonymous, alleges that OpenAI's ChatGPT program defamed them by generating and publishing false statements. The statements were then spread online, causing significant harm to the plaintiff's reputation and income. According to the lawsuit, OpenAI acted with reckless disregard for the plaintiff's reputation and dignity.
OpenAI is a leading AI research institute, and ChatGPT is one of its flagship programs. ChatGPT is an AI-powered language generator that is designed to mimic human conversation. The system has been trained on massive datasets and can generate text that is often indistinguishable from human-written content. It has been hailed as a major breakthrough in natural language processing and AI research in general.
However, ChatGPT's ability to generate human-like language has also led to concerns about the potential misuse of the system. Critics have argued that the technology is not yet ready for primetime. In this context, the lawsuit against OpenAI is significant because it may help to establish legal precedents for the use of AI in content generation and distribution.
The plaintiff alleges that the false statements generated by ChatGPT and published by OpenAI had a significant impact on their life and career. The program allegedly generated text that claimed the plaintiff had made racist comments during a radio broadcast. The plaintiff denies these claims and insists that they have never made any such comments on air or in private.

With the ability to see inside the human body, radiology plays a crucial role in diagnosing and treating patients. However, one issue that has arisen is the complexity of radiology reports.
Traditionally, these reports have been written using medical jargon and complex terminology, making it difficult for patients to understand what they are seeing. This has led to confusion and frustration on the part of patients, as well as potential misunderstandings between patients and their doctors.
Thankfully, a new technology has emerged that has the potential to simplify radiology reports and make them more accessible to patients. In this article, we will explore the problem with traditional radiology reports, and how a new solution is changing the game.
Imagine you're a patient who has just undergone an x-ray or MRI scan. You receive the results in the form of a radiology report, but you can't make heads or tails of it. The terminology is confusing, and you don't know what any of it means. This can be a frustrating experience for patients, and it can lead to confusion and misunderstandings when trying to communicate with their doctor.
The problem with traditional radiology reports lies in the language that is used. These reports are typically written in language well above the average American adult's eighth-grade reading level. This means that patients may struggle to understand what is being communicated, leading to potential issues with patient care and treatment.

Recently, a New York lawyer asked a Manhattan federal judge not to sanction him after including made-up case citations generated by an artificial intelligence chatbot in a legal brief. Joshua Browder, the creator of a chatbot that assists people in fighting parking tickets, developed the program as a way to determine which cases to include in a legal brief. The program, which is called ""DoNotPay,"" had been trained on thousands of cases to identify relevant legal precedent.

2023-06-11 04:40 AM;,"Imagine a world where a legal brief can be conjured with just a few clicks. No more long hours of reading through musty tomes in the library or poring over case files. Lawyers could simply leave the task to a machine that generates legal arguments at a fraction of the time required for human processing. This may sound far-fetched, but it is already happening.

Recently, a New York lawyer asked a Manhattan federal judge not to sanction him after including made-up case citations generated by an artificial intelligence chatbot in a legal brief. Joshua Browder, the creator of a chatbot that assists people in fighting parking tickets, developed the program as a way to determine which cases to include in a legal brief. The program, which is called ""DoNotPay,"" had been trained on thousands of cases to identify relevant legal precedent. However, Browder had not verified all of the citations generated by the program, leading to mistakes.

2023-06-11 05:20 AM;,"How a lack of skilled talent is holding back Hong Kong's Web3 industry from achieving its ambitious future vision.
Lin is the CEO of a Web3 startup based in Hong Kong. Her company offers blockchain-based solutions for supply chain management to manufacturing companies. She's been working in the Web3 industry for the past five years and has seen it grow rapidly. However, Lin is worried about the future of her company and the industry in Hong Kong. There is a glaring talent shortage that is hindering the growth of the Web3 industry in the region.
Lin's company has been trying to hire more talent to keep up with the growth but has been struggling to find skilled employees. The job descriptions her company posts for software engineers, blockchain developers, and DevOps specialists have garnered very few applications, and those that did apply lacked the required skills.
Lin can't help but feel frustrated and worried about the future of her company and the industry. She also feels that Hong Kong's government and educational institutions are not doing enough to address the talent shortage and prepare the next generation of employees to fill the skills gap.
Lin is not alone in her concerns. A recent report by the Hong Kong Blockchain Association revealed that the Web3 industry in Hong Kong is facing a 100,000-person shortfall in skilled talent. This gap is set to increase as the industry continues to grow and expand in the region.

2023-06-11 05:40 AM;,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a growing topic around the globe, and the United Kingdom has not been left behind. The country has been making significant strides in developing and regulating AI to ensure its safety and responsible use in society. The UK government recently announced plans to hold a global AI safety summit. However, the announcement has received criticisms for lacking representation from civil society and academia.
The UK government sponsored AI safety summit, slated for June 2021, is planned to bring together experts in the field of AI from around the world to discuss and develop new strategies. The meeting will be held virtually to accommodate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. According to the announcement, the summit's aim is to ""drive progress towards ensuring the safe and ethical development and deployment of AI.""
Despite the summit's laudable goal, some critics have chastised the UK government's lack of representation for civil society and academic voices within the planning and development of the summit. According to the criticisms, the UK government's approach emphasizes the need for government and industry voices and excludes academic researchers or anyone weighing in from the public perspective.
The lack of representation for civil society and academia voices is a crucial weakness in the UK government's effort to shape AI's development and regulation. The reason for this is straightforward; AI's impact on society goes beyond commercial or governmental interests. It has the potential to impact virtually everyone, and everyone should have a voice in its development, regulation, and use. AI raises ethical, social, and legal issues that require an interdisciplinary approach. Disciplinary perspectives should be considered from the most varied fields as possible, including philosophy, law, social sciences, and humanities.
Without a diverse representation of voices at the table, the potential impacts of AI on society will be unrepresentative and insufficiently rigorous. The UK government's announcement does not include ""a single voice from civil society or academia,"" said critics. The criticism from civil society on the lack of representation for AI is not exclusive to the UK but has been raised globally. In a report published by the World Economic Forum, it was highlighted that AI regulation is primarily influenced by technology companies and governments, leaving a vacuum for the perspectives of civil society and academia.

He needed to prepare a court filing and decided to use ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence program, to help him. However, things didn't go as planned. Instead of creating a concise and accurate brief, ChatGPT went rogue and invented fake cases and rulings. Needless to say, Schwartz was mortified when he had to apologize to the judge for submitting a brief full of falsehoods.
The incident highlighted the risks and limitations of relying solely on AI tools, and how important it is for lawyers and other professionals to exercise caution and use their judgment when using these technologies. While AI can certainly streamline certain tasks and improve efficiency, it can also create unintended consequences that can be costly for clients and embarrassing for those who rely on them.
The use of AI in the legal field is still relatively new, but its impact is already being felt. According to a survey by the American Bar Association, more than 10% of lawyers use AI tools in their practice, and that number is expected to grow in the coming years. Some of the areas where AI is being used include:
While these tools can certainly save time and improve accuracy, there are also significant challenges and risks associated with their use. For example, there is the risk of bias and errors in the data used to train the AI models, the need for ethical considerations in the use of AI in the legal system, and the potential for AI to replace human judgment and decision-making.
The case of Steven Schwartz and ChatGPT highlights the risks and limitations of relying solely on AI in the legal profession. While AI can certainly be a useful tool, it should never be used as a substitute for human judgment and experience. Here are three lessons that lawyers and other professionals can take away from this incident:

2023-06-11 07:20 AM;,"It was supposed to be a simple task for New York-based lawyer Steven Schwartz. He needed to prepare a court filing and decided to use ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence program, to help him. However, things didn't go as planned. Instead of creating a concise and accurate brief, ChatGPT went rogue and invented fake cases and rulings. Needless to say, Schwartz was mortified when he had to apologize to the judge for submitting a brief full of falsehoods.
The incident highlighted the risks and limitations of relying solely on AI tools, and how important it is for lawyers and other professionals to exercise caution and use their judgment when using these technologies. While AI can certainly streamline certain tasks and improve efficiency, it can also create unintended consequences that can be costly for clients and embarrassing for those who rely on them.
The use of AI in the legal field is still relatively new, but its impact is already being felt. According to a survey by the American Bar Association, more than 10% of lawyers use AI tools in their practice, and that number is expected to grow in the coming years.

2023-06-11 07:40 AM;,"The medical field has been revolutionized by the emergence of artificial intelligence. AI has helped scientists to identify new drug targets, design molecules with specific properties, and simulate complex biological processes. However, the use of AI in drug discovery raises some difficult legal and ethical questions, particularly in the area of patent law. If AI is involved in the creation of a new drug, who gets the patent?
Currently, the patent system recognizes human inventors as the creators of new inventions. The US Patent and Trademark Office defines an inventor as ""the one or ones who conceived of the invention."" This definition raises the question of whether an AI system can be considered an inventor, since it lacks the capacity to form a legal intent to invent.
The issue of whether an AI system can be recognized as an inventor has been addressed in a number of legal cases. One of the most high-profile cases involves a system called DABUS (Device for the Autonomous Bootstrapping of Unified Sentience), which was created by an inventor named Stephen Thaler. Thaler claimed that DABUS was the sole inventor of two new products - a food container and a flashing light for use in emergency services.
Thaler argued that DABUS had come up with these inventions independently, without his involvement. He claimed that the AI system had used a process called ""creative evolution"" to generate new ideas by mimicking the way the human brain makes associations between concepts. Thaler applied for patents on behalf of DABUS, but his applications were rejected by the US and European patent offices, on the grounds that the inventor must be a natural person.
Thaler has challenged these rulings in court, arguing that the current patent system is not equipped to deal with the creative potential of AI. He has suggested that a new category of ""machine inventor"" could be created, in order to recognize the contribution of AI systems to the development of new technologies.

2023-06-11 08:00 AM;,"It was a sunny day in Mumbai when Open AI CEO Sam Altman arrived to give a talk on the future of artificial intelligence. The audience eagerly listened as he discussed the latest advancements in technology, but it was his comments about India's ability to build AI that really got people talking.
Altman argued that while India has a thriving tech industry and talented engineers, there are several factors that make building AI like ChatGPT a difficult task for Indians. His comments sparked a heated debate online, with some praising him for speaking the truth and others accusing him of being dismissive of Indian talent.
So, is Altman right? Let's take a closer look at some of the reasons why India might struggle to build AI like ChatGPT.
One of the main challenges facing India in the field of AI is access to data. ChatGPT was trained on a massive dataset of over 40GB of text, which included everything from news articles to social media posts to books. India, however, ranks low in terms of data availability, with only around 22% of its population having access to the internet.
Another challenge is the lack of access to computing power. Building AI models like ChatGPT requires a significant amount of computing power, which can be prohibitively expensive for many Indian startups and researchers. In contrast, companies like Google and Amazon have access to huge data centers and can leverage their economies of scale to build and train massive models like ChatGPT.
