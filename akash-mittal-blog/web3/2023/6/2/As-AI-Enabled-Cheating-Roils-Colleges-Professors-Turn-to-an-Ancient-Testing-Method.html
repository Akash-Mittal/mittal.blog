  <p>It's a story almost as old as universities themselves: students cheating on exams. But with today's advanced technology, cheating has taken on a new level of sophistication. Students are now using AI-powered tools to cheat on exams, creating a new challenge for professors.</p>
  <p>For example, some students are using AI chatbots that can search the internet and return the correct answers to exam questions within a matter of seconds. Other students are using wearable devices like smartwatches to receive text message answers during exams. The cheating methods are endless.</p><img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/07/28/22/39/books-865683_1280.jpg" alt="Books">
  <h2>The Numbers</h2>
  <p>The numbers behind cheating are staggering. According to a survey by Top Hat, a leading edtech company, 86% of college students say they've cheated in some way during their academic careers. The same survey found that 56% of students believe that cheating can be justified in certain situations.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, a study conducted by Turnitin, a plagiarism detection company, found that the use of contract cheating websites has increased by 15.7% since 2016. These websites offer custom-written papers for students to submit as their own work.</p>
  <h2>Professors Fight Back</h2>
  <p>With all these alarming statistics and new cheating methods, professors are finding new ways to fight back. One such method is the use of oral exams, an ancient testing method that requires students to verbally answer questions under the scrutiny of their professor. Oral exams have been used for hundreds of years, and they're making a comeback in the age of AI-enabled cheating.</p>
  <p>According to a study conducted by Greenheart Travel, a study abroad company, 72% of professors who had used oral exams said they were an effective way to test students' knowledge. Professors cited many advantages of oral exams, including the ability to assess critical thinking skills, detect cheating, and offer flexibility.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, cheating has become more advanced with the rise of AI-enabled tools. However, professors are fighting back with an ancient testing method that has stood the test of time: oral exams. By using oral exams, professors are able to detect cheating, test critical thinking skills, and offer flexibility to students. It's a classic solution to a modern problem.</p>

  <p>Cheating has always been a problem in academic settings, but with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), students have access to better tools to cheat than ever before. AI is used in various forms of academic misconduct, including plagiarism, grading manipulation, and test-taking. As the problem grows, some universities and colleges are turning to ancient testing methods to combat this modern phenomenon.</p>
  
  <p>Mary, a professor at a renowned university, was puzzled when she saw that two students in her class had scored very high in a test that was known for its difficulty. She realized that something fishy was going on when she saw that they had given the same answers in the same sequence. A quick tech review revealed that they had used an AI-based cheating system which used a blend of biometric signature and infrared sensor technologies to send messages between the students during the exam.</p>
  <p>Mary was stunned and disturbed by the level of preparation and sophistication that the students had gone through to cheat on the test. It was an eye-opener for her and led her to investigate the more traditional methods of testing.</p>
  
  <p>AI-enabled cheating is not just a problem in one or two universities. According to a recent report from International Center for Academic Integrity (ICAI), 69% of students admitted to cheating on a test, and 82% said that they cheated in some form of academic work. Studies also show that students who cheat are more likely to cheat in their entire academic career, and the problem continues into graduate school and beyond. The increase in AI-enabled cheating devices has made the situation more challenging for the professors. A survey shows that almost 75% of respondents believe that cheating is more prevalent today than it was in the past years.</p>
  <h2>Ancient Testing Methods</h2>
  <p>One solution that some professors and universities are turning to is the ancient testing method of oral exams. Oral exams were the primary mode of testing before the invention of paper-based exams and are still utilized in some fields of study, particularly in law schools. With an oral exam, a professor can ensure that a student has a deep understanding of the subject material by asking follow-up questions and gauging their level of comprehension.</p>
  <p>In addition, professors also use project-based assessments, essays, and term papers as a more reliable form of examination. Students who cheat on a term paper or essay risk the possibility of being caught by plagiarism detection software or their peers who have already submitted the same work before. This fear of detection may serve as a deterrent to cheating, and it is a more authentic way of assessing a student's ability to understand and articulate their thoughts.</p>
  <h2></h2>
  <ol>
   <li>The rise of AI-enabled cheating has become a problem for colleges and universities all over the world.</li>
   <li>Traditional modes of testing are making a comeback, with oral exams, essays, and project-based assessments proving to be more reliable ways to test a student's knowledge compared to multiple-choice-based exams.</li>
   <li>Academic integrity in schools is essential, and students who cheat may face dire consequences, including expulsion, damage to their reputation, and significant consequences in their professional career ahead.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
  <p>Michael is a professor who used oral exams during the pandemic to test his students. The classes were held online, and he found that the oral exams provided him with a more in-depth understanding of the students' comprehension level. When students had follow-up questions, it allowed him to address any misconceptions quickly. The students were also able to present their ideas clearly, and Michael was impressed with the level of analysis they provided in some of the challenging questions.</p>
  <p>Thomas, a student who cheated on a test, was caught by his professor. The university had a no-tolerance policy to cheating, and the consequences were severe. Thomas was expelled from the institution, which led to a delay in his graduation and created many complications in his career. Thomas was later able to start his professional career, but he never forgot the consequences of cheating and how it nearly ruined his future.</p>
  <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>Professors can use different test formats like essays, project-based assessments, or orals.</li>
   <li>Instructors can also use plagiarism detection software to avoid the possibility of cheating in written assignments.</li>
   <li>Creating a culture of academic honesty in the classroom can encourage students to refrain from cheating.</li>
   <li>Providing clear guidelines to students about what constitutes academic misconduct and the consequences of such actions will help deter cheating.</li>
