  <h1>Web3 Gaming Goes Mainstream: Telos and GameStop Team Up</h1> <img src="images/Web3-Gaming-Goes-Mainstream-Telos-and-GameStop-Team-Up.jpeg" alt="+Web3-Gaming-Goes-Mainstream-Telos-and-GameStop-Team-Up+">
  <p></p>
  <p>It all started with a young boy named Jack. Jack loved video games and spent hours playing them every day. His favorite game was a web3 game called "CryptoKitties", which allowed users to collect, breed, and trade virtual cats using blockchain technology. Jack loved the fact that he could own his virtual cats and that no one could take them away from him.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>As Jack grew older, he realized that web3 gaming was still a niche market, even though it had been around for several years. He also noticed that many gamers were still hesitant to try web3 games because of the complex setup and the fact that they needed to own cryptocurrency to participate.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>That's when Telos and GameStop stepped in. Telos is a blockchain network that is designed to be fast, efficient, and user-friendly. GameStop is a popular video game retailer that has been struggling to compete with the rise of digital downloads. Together, they saw an opportunity to bring web3 gaming mainstream and make it more accessible to everyone.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable Examples:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Since partnering with GameStop, Telos has seen a significant increase in daily active users on its network. In just two months, the number of daily active users has grown by over 400%, with over 10,000 users now using the network every day.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One of the main reasons for this growth is the introduction of Telos on GameStop's "Power to the Players" platform, which allows users to purchase Telos tokens directly from the GameStop website. This means that gamers no longer need to go through the complex setup process of creating a cryptocurrency wallet and buying cryptocurrency from a third-party exchange. Instead, they can simply use their credit card to buy Telos tokens on GameStop's website and start playing web3 games right away.</p>
