    <h2>An interesting story</h2>
    <p>Imagine you work for a large financial institution, and you need to have a conversation with one of your clients about their mortgage application. You decide to use a chatbot to handle the conversation since it's faster and more convenient than a phone call. However, during the conversation, the chatbot accidentally reveals sensitive information about the client's financial situation, which should have been kept confidential. This is just one example of how AI tools like chatbots can pose a risk to privacy and security.</p>
    <h2>Quantifiable examples</h2>
    <p>According to a survey conducted by Accenture, 54% of consumers said they would be willing to use chatbots to make banking transactions, but only 34% said they were comfortable with their financial institutions using AI to recommend products or provide guidance. Furthermore, a report by Gartner predicts that by 2022, 70% of white-collar workers will interact with conversational platforms on a daily basis.</p>
    <h2>Personal anecdotes and case studies</h2>
    <p>One company that has experienced the benefits of using AI tools like chatbots is Capital One. They developed a chatbot called Eno that interacts with customers over text message, providing them with account information, making payments, and answering questions. According to Ken Dodelin, vice president of conversational AI products at Capital One, Eno has reduced call volume by 40% and increased customer satisfaction scores by 10%. However, Dodelin also acknowledges that the more conversational the AI tool is, the more potential there is for security risks.</p>
    <h2>Practical tips</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>Limit the amount of sensitive information that AI tools can access</li>
     <li>Implement multi-factor authentication for accessing AI tools</li>
     <li>Regularly test AI tools for vulnerabilities and address any issues promptly</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion in 3 points</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>AI tools like chatbots have the potential to improve customer experience and reduce workload for businesses</li>
     <li>However, they also pose a risk to privacy and security if not properly secured</li>
     <li>CISOs and other security professionals must implement guardrails to protect sensitive information while still leveraging the benefits of AI tools</li>
    </ol>
