   <h2>An Interesting Story: How C3 ai Missed Wall Street's Revenue Expectations</h2>
   <p>C3 ai is a leading enterprise AI software provider, offering a suite of applications designed to help organizations accelerate digital transformation. The company's stock plummeted after it reported mixed results for the first quarter, beating analysts' earnings but missing revenue expectations.</p>
   <p>C3 ai's Q1 revenue fell short of Wall Street's estimates, coming in at $52.1 million rather than the expected $54.4 million. The company attributed this miss to a delay in closing some large deals, but investors and analysts were clearly unimpressed.</p>
   <p>Upon the news, C3 ai's stock price dropped by over 20%, wiping out more than $2 billion in market capitalization. CEO Tom Siebel sought to reassure investors, telling them that the company's long-term prospects remained strong.</p>
   <h2>Quantifiable Examples: C3 ai's Q1 Earnings Report</h2>
   <p>Despite the revenue miss, C3 ai's Q1 earnings report did contain some bright spots. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.12, beating the expected $0.06. The company also raised its full-year earnings guidance, predicting adjusted EPS of $0.47 to $0.53, up from the previous guidance of $0.40 to $0.50.</p>
   <p>C3 ai's subscription revenue, a key metric for the company since it represents the recurring revenue stream from its customers, grew by 19% year-over-year to $44.4 million. The company's total recurring revenue grew by 18% year-over-year to $45.5 million.</p>

   <h2>Practical Tips: How to Navigate a Stock Market Sell-Off</h2>
   <p>Investors who stayed invested in C3 ai during the recent sell-off may be feeling anxious, but it's important to remember that market volatility can be a normal part of investing. Here are some practical tips to help you navigate a stock market sell-off:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Keep a long-term perspective - remember that the market tends to go up over time. If you believe in the company's long-term prospects, it may be wise to hold onto your shares.</li>
    <li>Diversify your portfolio - don't put all your eggs in one basket. Make sure you have a diverse portfolio that includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other types of investments.</li>
    <li>Don't panic - selling during a market downturn can be a costly mistake, as it locks in losses. Stay calm and assess your options before making any hasty decisions.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Personal Anecdote: Learning from Previous Stock Market Sell-Offs</h2>
   <p>As a seasoned investor, I have learned the value of keeping a long-term perspective during market volatility. During the dot-com crash in the early 2000s, many investors panicked and sold their tech stocks, only to miss out on the massive gains that tech companies would go on to make over the next decade.</p>
   <p>Similarly, during the 2008 financial crisis, many investors sold their stocks at the bottom of the market, only to miss out on the massive rebound that followed in the next few years.</p>
   <p>The lesson here is clear: don't let short-term market volatility dictate your long-term investment strategy. Stay the course, and remember that the market tends to go up over time.</p>
