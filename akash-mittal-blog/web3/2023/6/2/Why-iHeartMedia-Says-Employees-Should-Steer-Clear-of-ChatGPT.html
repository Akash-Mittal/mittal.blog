    <h2>The Story Behind iHeartMedia's Warning</h2>
    <p>A few months ago, a group of iHeartMedia employees discovered a new chat app called ChatGPT. The app used AI to generate responses that were often witty and engaging, and it quickly became popular among the team. However, as the group started using the app more frequently, they noticed that their conversations were becoming increasingly disjointed and unproductive. People were spending more time typing out messages to the app than actually communicating with each other.</p>
    <p>Concerned about the impact this was having on their work, the team brought their concerns to management. After conducting their own investigation into the app, iHeartMedia executives decided to issue a company-wide warning to all employees, urging them to avoid using ChatGPT for work-related communication.</p>

    <h2>The Quantifiable Impact on Productivity</h2>
    <p>The decision to issue a warning about ChatGPT was not made lightly. iHeartMedia conducted a study that found employees who used the app spent an average of 15 minutes more per day on nonessential communication than those who did not use it. This may not sound like much, but when you consider that iHeartMedia has over 18,000 employees worldwide, those extra 15 minutes can add up to a significant loss in productivity.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the study found that employees who used ChatGPT were more likely to experience interruptions during their workday. This was because the app would send notifications for every message, even if it was not relevant to the task at hand. As a result, employees who used ChatGPT reported feeling more stressed and less focused than those who did not use it.</p>

    <h2>The Magnetic Headline: "The Chat App That's Killing Your Productivity"</h2>
    <p>The decision to warn employees about ChatGPT was not just about productivity, however. There were also concerns about the quality of communication that was taking place on the app. As one iHeartMedia executive put it, "ChatGPT is great for generating clever one-liners, but it's terrible for having meaningful conversations."</p>
    <p>This sentiment is reflected in many of the headlines that have been written about the app in recent weeks. Some of the most eye-catching include:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>"The Chat App That's Killing Your Productivity"</li>
     <li>"Why Your Coworkers Are Sending You Random Gifs Instead of Doing Real Work"</li>
     <li>"ChatGPT: The App That's Ruining Your Ability to Communicate"</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What You Should Do Instead</h2>
    <p>If you're an iHeartMedia employee (or anyone else) who has been using ChatGPT and is now feeling concerned about its impact on your productivity and communication skills, there are a few things you can do:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Limit your use of the app to nonessential communication only</li>
     <li>Turn off notifications for the app so it's not constantly interrupting you</li>
     <li>Try to have more face-to-face conversations or phone calls instead of relying on text-based communication</li>
     <li>Consider using a different chat app that is less distracting and more conducive to meaningful conversation</li>
    </ul>
