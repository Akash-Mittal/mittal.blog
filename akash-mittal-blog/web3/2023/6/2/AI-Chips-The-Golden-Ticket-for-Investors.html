  <h1>AI Chips: The Golden Ticket for Investors</h1> <img src="images/AI-Chips-The-Golden-Ticket-for-Investors.jpeg" alt="+AI-Chips-The-Golden-Ticket-for-Investors+">
  <p></p>
  <p>Once upon a time, there was a company called Nvidia that turned a sleepy gaming graphics technology into a $500 billion empire. Today, Nvidia is a key player in artificial intelligence (AI) chips, an industry set to grow to $91 billion by 2025. But Nvidia isn't the only one in the game. There are several other AI chip makers that investors are eagerly watching. Let's take a look at these hot chips, what they're for, and why they're golden in the eyes of investors.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Nvidia's Ampere GPU</p>
  <p>Nvidia's Ampere GPU is the company's latest and greatest graphics processing unit. It's designed for gaming, high-performance computing, and AI training. In fact, the company claims that Ampere provides a 20x speedup for AI workloads compared to its previous generation. And investors are taking note. In the past year, Nvidia's stock price has surged more than 150%.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Intel's Nervana</p>
  <p>Intel is a dominant player in the semiconductor industry, and the company's Nervana AI chip is causing a stir. Nervana is built specifically for deep learning, a type of AI that's particularly useful for tasks like image and speech recognition. Investors are excited about Nervana because deep learning is a rapidly growing field, and Intel has a lot of data center customers who need this kind of technology.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Graphcore's Colossus MK2</p>
  <p>Graphcore is a relatively unknown company, but its Colossus MK2 AI chip is turning heads. The chip is built for AI training, and it's optimized for the new breed of neural network models that are gaining popularity. Graphcore claims that Colossus MK2 can provide a 100x speedup for some of these models, which is a huge advantage for companies that are working with large amounts of data. Investors are excited about Graphcore because the company has a lot of potential in the data center market.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>4. Google's TPU</p>
  <p>Google has been working on its own custom AI chips for years, and the company's Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) is now in its third generation. TPUs are designed specifically for AI inference, which is the process of taking a trained model and using it to make predictions or decisions. Google uses TPUs extensively in its cloud services, and investors are bullish on the company's ability to dominate the AI infrastructure market.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>5. Qualcomm's AI Engine</p>
  <p>Qualcomm may be best known for its smartphone processors, but the company is also making waves in the AI chip market. Qualcomm's AI Engine is a software/hardware platform that's designed to make it easy for developers to incorporate AI into their products. The platform includes a suite of AI tools, as well as a dedicated AI processor that's integrated into Qualcomm's Snapdragon mobile processors. Investors are excited about Qualcomm's potential to dominate the mobile AI market.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. The AI chip market is set to grow to $91 billion by 2025, and investors are eager to get in on the action.</p>
  <p>2. Nvidia's Ampere GPU, Intel's Nervana, Graphcore's Colossus MK2, Google's TPU, and Qualcomm's AI Engine are all hot chips that investors are watching closely.</p>
  <p>3. The companies that can dominate the AI infrastructure market are likely to be big winners in the coming years.</p>
