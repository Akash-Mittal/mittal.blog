     <p>It wasn't too long ago when we had to use our hands to guide our smartphones to get things done. But with the emergence of virtual assistants like Siri and Google Assistant, all we have to do now is simply speak to them. It's hard to imagine life without them now, isn't it? But what really goes on behind the scenes? How do these assistants know what we're saying? The answer lies in AI technology. AI has created new, innovative solutions that have made our lives easier and more convenient. Not only has it revolutionized the tech industry, but it's changed the way we interact with our devices.</p>
     
     <p>According to a recent S&amp;P Global report, the AI market is expected to grow from $9.5 billion in 2018 to $118.6 billion by 2025, with a growth rate of 30.4%. The biggest contributors to this growth will be enterprise software applications, which are projected to grow to $31.2 billion in 2025, compared to $1.6 billion in 2018. This growth is driven by the need for companies to optimize operations, increase efficiency, and reduce costs. AI is helping businesses do exactly that by providing valuable insights that help to make informed decisions.</p>

     <p>My grandmother was not a technology person. She always preferred the traditional way of working with things. But then, I got her a smartwatch with voice recognition technology. She is not struggling with her watch anymore. All she has to do is speak to it and it performs the functions she wants. This is a small but powerful example of how AI has revolutionized technology by making it accessible to everyone.</p>
