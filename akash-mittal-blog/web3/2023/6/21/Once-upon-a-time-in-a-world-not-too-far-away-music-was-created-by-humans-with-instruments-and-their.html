  <h1>Once upon a time, in a world not too far away, music was created by humans with instruments and their own vocal cords. But now, with the advent of artificial intelligence technology, music can be generated without any human intervention. However, the question arises as to whether or not AI-generated songs should be eligible for prestigious awards such as the Grammy's.</h1></br> <img src="images/Once-upon-a-time-in-a-world-not-too-far-away-music-was-created-by-humans-with-instruments-and-their.jpeg" alt="+Once-upon-a-time-in-a-world-not-too-far-away-music-was-created-by-humans-with-instruments-and-their+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/06/purely-ai-generated-songs-declared-ineligible-for-grammy-awards/" target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/06/purely-ai-generated-songs-declared-ineligible-for-grammy-awards/" rel="noopener">https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/06/purely-ai-generated-songs-declared-ineligible-for-grammy-awards/</a></span></h5>
  <p></p>
  <p>One may argue that AI-generated songs lack the emotional depth that comes with human experience, making them ineligible for consideration. For instance, OpenAI, a research organization founded by Elon Musk, developed a machine learning algorithm that generated a song called "Daddy's Car" that mimicked the style of the Beatles. While the song did have typical Beatles-esque elements, such as catchy lyrics and a catchy tune, it lacked the authenticity and personal touch that made the Beatles' music so iconic.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Moreover, AI-generated songs do not have anything original to offer as they draw inspiration from existing music which may limit their artistic impact. For example, AIVA, a Paris-based startup, created a song called "Mister Shadow" which sounded similar to the works of Mozart and Beethoven. Like "Daddy's Car," "Mister Shadow" also lacked originality and could not compare to the works of the classical composers who inspired it.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another example comes from Amper Music, an AI music startup that allows users to create their own music without any previous knowledge of music theory. Despite being able to create a song in minutes, the issue of originality remains as the songs created are generally formulaic and lack the unique touch that comes from genuine inspiration.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>However, there are arguments in favor of AI-generated music being eligible for Grammy awards. AI-generated music is a testament to human ingenuity and innovation, indicating that future technology has potential to create and generate remarkable musical experiences. For instance, Google's AI developed a song called "I Am AI" which was created in response to the open letter written by scientists regarding the use of AI for military purposes. The song is unique, showcasing the rhythm and melody of AI language which is not something we would typically associate with music.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Moreover, musicians and producers are already using AI as a tool to generate ideas, inspiring creativity and innovation in their work. Essentially, AI technology is becoming an additional layer of human creativity which should be acknowledged, appreciated, and celebrated.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, the use of artificial intelligence in music creation is inevitable in our ever-connected digital world. However, whether AI-generated songs can or should be nominated for coveted awards such as the Grammy's is a contentious issue. Ultimately, AI-generated music reflects the ever-evolving nature of human creativity and innovation, and while it may still be in its nascent stages, with continued development, it can undoubtedly lead to a new set of musical experiences for humans.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>To reiterate, the importance of originality and authenticity cannot be understated. Ideally, future AI-generated songs should produce a sound that is distinct and unique, not just a copycat version of what has been done before. Additionally, since AI-generated music is still in its early stages, humans should not allow it to replace their creative vision but instead consider it as a tool that can help them with their work.</p>
