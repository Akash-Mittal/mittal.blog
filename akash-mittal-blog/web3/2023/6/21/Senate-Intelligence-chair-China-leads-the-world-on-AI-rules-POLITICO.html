    <h2>A Story of AI Progression in China</h2>
    <p>China has been making exceptional progress in AI development over the years. It all began in 2017 when AlphaGo, a program developed by Google's Deep Mind, defeated the world's best Go player, Ke Jie. After this event, China became immensely interested in AI and its potential applications.</p>
    <p>Since then, China has been making significant strides in AI development and is now leading the world in AI rules and regulations, according to the Senate Intelligence chair.</p>

    <h2>Examples of China's AI Dominance</h2>
    <p>China is making AI advancements in various sectors, including healthcare, transportation, and finance. One example is the AI-powered facial recognition system used by Chinese hospitals. It helps doctors diagnose rare diseases by comparing images of patients with those in a database.</p>
    <p>In the transportation sector, China is using AI to develop self-driving cars. According to a report by McKinsey, more than 10 million self-driving cars could hit China's roads by 2030. This could significantly reduce accidents and traffic congestion.</p>
    <p>China is also using AI in the finance sector to detect fraudulent activities. The Agricultural Bank of China uses facial recognition and voice recognition to verify the identities of their customers.</p>
