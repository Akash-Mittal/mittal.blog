   <p class="subtitle">Story of How AI Became a Concern for Regulators</p>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>In 2017, a Tesla Model S car crashed into a truck while on autopilot, killing the driver.</p>
   <p>Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board found that the car's collision avoidance system failed to detect the truck due to the "limitations of the Tesla's vision-based perception system."</p>
   <p>Since then, concerns about artificial intelligence have only grown among regulators, lawmakers, and the public at large.</p>
   <p>That's why a new bipartisan legislation introduced by a House member is welcome news for those who worry about the risks of unregulated AI.</p>
   <p>The legislation, called the "AI in Government Act," would establish a federal advisory board on AI to advise the government on the ethical and safe development and deployment of AI technology across various sectors.</p>
   <h2>Examples of AI Misuse</h2>
   <p>The AI in Government Act is not the first attempt at regulating AI in the United States, but it is one of the most comprehensive and proactive approaches to date.</p>
   <p>Part of the reason for this is the increasing evidence of the risks associated with unregulated AI.</p>
   <p>For instance, a study conducted in 2018 found that facial recognition technology could be used to identify someone's political affiliation, religion, and even emotions with a high degree of accuracy.</p>
   <p>Not only does this pose privacy concerns, but it also raises the question of what happens when political affiliations and religious beliefs are used to discriminate against people in hiring, lending, and other key areas of life.</p>
   <p>Another example is the misuse of algorithms in the criminal justice system, which has led to racial bias in sentencing and the unfair treatment of minority defendants.</p>
   <h2> on AI</h2>
   <p>The dangers of AI aren't just hypothetical scenarios; they are realities that people are already experiencing.</p>
   <p>For instance, in 2019, a group of Amazon workers filed a petition against the company's use of facial recognition technology, citing concerns about surveillance and the potential for discrimination.</p>
   <p>The workers' concerns weren't just theoretical; they had witnessed firsthand how the technology was used to track and monitor employees in the workplace.</p>
   <p>Such personal anecdotes highlight the need for regulations that protect people from the worst consequences of AI.</p>
   <h2></h2>
   <ol>
    <li>The AI in Government Act is a step in the right direction for regulating AI and mitigating its negative impacts on society.</li>
    <li>The examples of AI misuse and personal anecdotes show that the risks of unregulated AI are not hypothetical but real and present dangers.</li>
    <li>Regulations that prioritize ethical and safe use of AI have benefits for both individuals and society at large, ensuring the technology is used in ways that promote fairness and equality.</li>
