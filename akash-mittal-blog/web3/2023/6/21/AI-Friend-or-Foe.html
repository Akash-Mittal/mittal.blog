    <h2>Impact on Jobs and Industries</h2>
    <p>The introduction of AI has led to concerns over the potential loss of jobs across various industries.

     <li><strong>New Skills and Jobs</strong>: As AI develops, new job roles and skill sets will emerge. For instance, creating AI systems, maintaining them, and developing algorithms that can work alongside humans.</li>
     <li><strong>Training and Education</strong>: To adapt to the changing job market brought about by AI, individuals and organizations must invest in lifelong learning and skill development.</li>
