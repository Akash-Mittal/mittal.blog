  <p>You wake up one morning and reach for your phone to check your messages. As you scroll through your favorite social media platform, you come across a game that catches your eye. It's a Web3 game - something you've heard about but never played before. You decide to give it a try and before you know it, you're hooked.</p>
  <p>This scenario is becoming more and more common thanks to companies like Super Snappy. Their mission is to bring engaging, interactive games to social messaging platforms through the use of Web3 technology.</p>
  <h2>What is Web3 Technology?</h2>
  <p>Before we dive into Super Snappy's mission, let's first define what we mean by Web3 technology. Web3 is the next evolution of the internet, also known as the decentralized web. Unlike the current internet (Web2), which is controlled by a few large corporations, Web3 is a network of interconnected systems that are owned and controlled by their users.</p>
  <p>One of the key features of Web3 technology is the use of blockchain, which allows for secure and transparent transactions. This means that Web3 games can use cryptocurrency as a form of payment and can also allow for users to truly own their in-game assets.</p>
  <h2>Super Snappy's Mission</h2>
  <p>Super Snappy is a London-based startup that is focused on making Web3 games accessible to a wider audience by bringing them to social messaging platforms. Their goal is to create fun and engaging games that can be played with friends and family, all while utilizing the security and transparency of blockchain technology.</p>
  <p>One example of a game Super Snappy has created is called "CryptoBrawl." It's a fast-paced, multiplayer fighting game that uses cryptocurrency as a form of payment. Players can earn rewards by winning fights and can use those rewards to purchase new weapons and gear.</p>
  <p>Another game in development by Super Snappy is called "CryptoFarm." This game will allow players to own and manage their own virtual farms, all while using cryptocurrency as a form of payment. Players can earn rewards by growing crops and selling them on a virtual marketplace.</p>
  <h2>Why Social Messaging Platforms?</h2>
  <p>Social messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp have become a central part of people's daily lives. People spend hours a day on these platforms, chatting with friends and family, sharing photos and videos, and even conducting business.</p>
  <p>By bringing Web3 games to these platforms, Super Snappy is able to reach a much wider audience than they would by creating standalone games. Not only that, but social messaging platforms provide the perfect environment for multiplayer games. Players can easily invite their friends and family to play and can even create their own tournaments and competitions.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, Super Snappy is working hard to make Web3 games more accessible to a wider audience by bringing them to social messaging platforms. Their innovative use of blockchain technology and focus on creating fun and engaging games is sure to make them a major player in the Web3 gaming space.</p>
