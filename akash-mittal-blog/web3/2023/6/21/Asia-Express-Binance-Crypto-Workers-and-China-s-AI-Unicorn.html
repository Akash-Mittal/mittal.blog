    <h2>A Story of Growth and Humiliation</h2>
    <p>It was just a few years ago when Binance, the cryptocurrency exchange based in Malta, was on top of the world. Its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, was hailed as a visionary who could take on established players like Bittrex and Poloniex. Binance quickly became the go-to exchange for traders who wanted to buy and sell altcoins that were not available on mainstream exchanges like Coinbase.</p>
    <p>But then came the hacks, the security breaches, and the regulators. Somehow, Binance managed to survive all of these challenges. However, the recent decision of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) of the United Kingdom to ban the exchange from operating in the country has dealt a heavy blow to Binance's reputation. The FCA's move was followed by similar actions from regulatory bodies in Japan, Germany, and other countries. As a result, Binance has lost a considerable percentage of its user base, and its market dominance is being challenged by newer players like FTX and Bybit.</p>

    <h2>Hong Kong Needs 100,000 Crypto Workers</h2>
    <p>Despite the challenges faced by Binance, the cryptocurrency industry in Asia is still growing, and Hong Kong is positioning itself as a hub for crypto innovation. The city-state's government has recently announced its plan to allocate HKD 500 million (USD 64.2 million) to develop its fintech sector, with a focus on blockchain and virtual assets.</p>
    <p>But the real challenge for Hong Kong is finding the human resources to drive its crypto industry. According to a study by the Hong Kong Blockchain Association, the city-state would need at least 100,000 blockchain and crypto professionals to meet the demand of the industry in the next few years. The study also found that the current supply of such professionals in Hong Kong is only around 10,000.</p>
    <p>The shortage of talent is not unique to Hong Kong. Many other countries in Asia are facing the same problem. For example, Singapore, which is also a major hub for fintech startups and blockchain projects, is struggling to attract and retain talented developers and engineers.</p>

    <h2>China's AI Unicorn</h2>
    <p>In the midst of all these developments, China's tech industry is continuing its meteoric rise. One of the most impressive players is SenseTime, a Beijing-based startup that specializes in artificial intelligence (AI). Founded in 2014, SenseTime has quickly become a unicorn, with a valuation of over USD 4.5 billion.</p>
    <p>SenseTime's achievements are even more remarkable in light of the challenges faced by other Chinese tech giants like Huawei, which have been blacklisted by the US government. Despite the geopolitical tensions, SenseTime has managed to attract investments from international firms like SoftBank and Qualcomm. The company's technology is also being used in various industries, from healthcare to autonomous driving.</p>
