  <p>Google, in particular, has a strong stake in the AI development sphere, with many of its core businesses relying heavily on intelligence and automation in their operations. For the tech giant, contributing to France's AI agenda could provide valuable insights into how to navigate the ethical and practical considerations involved in developing these technologies in a socially responsible way.</p>
