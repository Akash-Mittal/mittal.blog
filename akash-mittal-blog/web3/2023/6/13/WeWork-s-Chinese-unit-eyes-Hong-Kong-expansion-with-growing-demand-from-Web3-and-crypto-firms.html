     <h2>Story</h2>
     <p>WeWork's minority-owned China unit is looking to expand its presence in Hong Kong as demand from Web3 and crypto firms increases alongside the reopening of mainland borders. Trustbridge Partners, a Shanghai-based investment firm, holds the majority 51% stake in the unit, while WeWork Global holds a minority stake.</p>
     <p>According to recent reports, more and more Chinese firms are seeking out flexible office spaces in Hong Kong. These spaces offer them more cost-effective and efficient options to establish a presence and carry out their business operations. As a result, WeWork's Chinese unit is now planning to expand its operations in Hong Kong to cater to the growing demand from these firms.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h2>Examples</h2>
     <p>One prime example of a Chinese firm turning to flexible office spaces in Hong Kong is Bitmain, one of the world's leading cryptocurrency mining firms. The company had initially set up an office in Hong Kong in 2018 but later moved to a WeWork location in the city. WeWork's flexible office spaces allowed Bitmain to easily scale up or down its operations as per its needs, and the company no longer had to bear the high costs of maintaining a fixed office location.</p>
     <p>Another example is Huobi, a cryptocurrency exchange that also operates in Hong Kong. The company had reportedly leased a 20,000-square-foot office space in Wan Chai, a prime location in the city, at a rent of HKD 1.5 million per month. However, with the current market volatility and unpredictability of the crypto industry, Huobi has now turned to flexible office space providers to explore more cost-effective options for its operations.</p>

     <h2>Personal anecdotes and case studies</h2>
     <p>One entrepreneur from China, who wished to remain anonymous, shared his experience of setting up an office in Hong Kong. He said that the high costs of leasing an office space and hiring staff posed a significant challenge for his startup. However, by choosing a flexible office space, he was able to overcome these challenges and establish a foothold in the city.</p>
