  <p>Meet Cathie Wood, a super investor who is making big waves in the tech industry with her disruptive innovation funds. Her flagship fund, Ark Innovation ETF, has made some impressive gains over the years, thanks to her bold bets in transformative technologies such as AI (artificial intelligence) and robotics.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>When it comes to AI, it's hard to ignore some of the leading companies in this space, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU).

  <p></p>
  <p>2. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA)</p>
