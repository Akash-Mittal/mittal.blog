  <p>Thirdweb, a Web3 infrastructure startup with a focus on gaming, has enlisted the services of a former Meta executive to lead its gaming division. This move is expected to bring increased credibility to the startup and enable it to compete with the big players in the space, such as Immutable and Enjin.</p>
  <h2>The Story</h2>
  <p>Thirdweb was founded in 2020 by a group of blockchain enthusiasts who wanted to streamline the creation and deployment of blockchain-based applications. The startup has since built a robust infrastructure that simplifies the process of creating and deploying Web3 applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi) dApps and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces.</p>
  <p>However, Thirdweb identified gaming as a key area for growth and expansion, as games are one of the biggest use cases for NFTs and Web3 technology in general. To spearhead this push into gaming, the startup has recruited a former executive from Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, to lead its gaming division.</p>
  <h2>The Executive</h2>
  <p>The former Meta executive in question is John Dang, who served as a director of business development at the social media giant. Dang brings a wealth of experience and expertise to Thirdweb, having spent several years at Facebook and a number of other tech companies.</p>
  <p>"I'm thrilled to be joining Thirdweb and leading its gaming division," Dang said in a statement. "I believe that blockchain technology has enormous potential to revolutionize the gaming industry, and Thirdweb is well positioned to be a leader in this space."</p>
  <h2>The Potential</h2>
  <p>The potential for blockchain-based gaming is immense. In addition to enabling new revenue models for developers, NFTs allow for true ownership and transferability of in-game assets, which has been a long-standing issue in traditional gaming. With blockchain technology, gamers can truly own their in-game items and even sell them on secondary markets.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, blockchain technology can help ensure the transparency and fairness of in-game economies, reducing the possibility of fraud and cheating. This can lead to increased trust among gamers, which can in turn lead to increased engagement and revenue for game developers.</p>
  <h2>The Competition</h2>
  <p>However, Thirdweb is far from the only company targeting the blockchain-based gaming space. Immutable and Enjin, two of the biggest players in the space, have already developed platforms that allow for easy integration of NFTs and blockchain technology into games.</p>
  <p>Other startups, such as Gala Games and The Sandbox, are also developing blockchain-based games that use NFTs as a core component. And established gaming companies, such as Ubisoft and Atari, are also exploring the potential of blockchain technology in gaming.</p>
  <h2>The Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Despite the competition, Thirdweb has a strong foundation upon which to build its gaming division. With its focus on Web3 infrastructure and a solid leadership team that includes a former Meta executive, the startup is well positioned to make a splash in the blockchain-based gaming space.</p>
  <p>If Thirdweb can execute on its vision and create a user-friendly platform that allows for easy integration of blockchain technology into games, it has the potential to revolutionize the gaming industry and create new opportunities for developers and gamers alike.</p>
