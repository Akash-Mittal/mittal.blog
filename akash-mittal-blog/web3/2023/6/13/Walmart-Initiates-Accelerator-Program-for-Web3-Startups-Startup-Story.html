     <h2>The Story</h2>
     <p>In 2017, Walmart introduced Store No.8, an innovation hub that aimed to develop and test cutting-edge commerce technologies. One of the key initiatives of Store No.8 is its accelerator program for web3 startups.</p>
     <p>The program provides selected startups with access to Walmart's vast resources, including mentorship from experienced executives, funding, and opportunities to test their technologies in Walmart's physical stores. The startups, in turn, collaborate with Walmart on projects that aim to enhance the retail experience for customers.</p>
     <p>The accelerator program is a part of Walmart's larger strategy to stay ahead of the curve in the rapidly evolving retail landscape. By partnering with innovative startups, the company hopes to experiment with new technologies and get a head start on the future of retail.</p>

     <h2>Examples</h2>
     <p>One of the most successful startups to emerge from the accelerator program is Spatial&amp;, a virtual reality (VR) company that creates immersive shopping experiences. Walmart collaborated with Spatial&amp; to develop a VR showroom that allows customers to explore and interact with home decor products before making a purchase.</p>
     <p>Another startup, Flytrex, is working with Walmart on a drone delivery pilot program. The program is aimed at providing faster and more efficient delivery options for customers, especially those in rural areas.</p>
     <p>Other startups that have participated in the program include Bazaarvoice, a platform for customer-generated content; Inkling, a mobile learning platform for retail employees; and Project Franklin, a blockchain-based system for managing supply chain data.</p>
