    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>It was just an innocent selfie. Maria took it while on vacation with her friends. She posted it on social media without a second thought. But then she started receiving messages from strangers with explicit comments and requests. She was shocked and scared. How did this happen?</p>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>This is just one example of how malicious actors are using AI to manipulate innocent images and videos to create explicit content. Here are some other examples:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Deepfake pornography: AI-generated videos of celebrities or unsuspecting individuals engaging in sexual acts.</li>
     <li>Revenge porn: Explicit photos or videos shared online without the consent of the person depicted.</li>
     <li>Virtual child pornography: AI-generated images or videos of children engaged in sexual acts, which are technically legal because no actual children were involved.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The use of AI to create explicit content from innocent images is a growing threat that must not be underestimated. Here are three key takeaways:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>The FBI is aware of this threat and is taking it seriously. They are working on ways to counter the use of AI by malicious actors.</li>
     <li>The public must be aware of the risks and take measures to protect themselves, such as being mindful of the images and videos they share online, and reporting any suspicious behavior to the authorities.</li>
     <li>The development of AI must be accompanied by responsible use and regulation to prevent its misuse for harmful purposes.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Let Maria's story be a cautionary tale. The use of AI for malicious purposes is a real danger that could affect anyone. Stay informed and stay safe.</p>
    <p>If you or anyone you know has been a victim of this type of crime, please contact the FBI or local law enforcement.</p>
