    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>Recently, many people have been turning towards Chatbots as a source of information. These chatbots, programmed by AI, aim to provide medical advice and information. However, when it comes to urology, ChatGPT, one of the most popular chatbots, may not be as reliable a source of information as we previously thought.</p>
    <h2>Why ChatGPT often gets it wrong in urological practice?</h2>
    <p>Christopher M. Deibert, MD, MPH, has pointed out that ChatGPT has a low rate of correct answers regarding clinical questions in urologic practice. While AI may be able to process a vast amount of information, it may not always be able to understand the nuances of the medical field.</p>
    <p>One of the reasons for this low rate of correct answers is due to the fact that ChatGPT is not a certified medical practitioner. Urologists and other healthcare professionals have extensive training, which allows them to diagnose and treat patients. They examine patients in person and take into account various physical factors and subjective factors that can affect medical diagnosis. Chatbots, on the other hand, do not have any physical interaction with patients and solely rely on programmed algorithms to interpret data.</p>
    <p>Moreover, ChatGPT's responses are based on data it has been programmed with, which can be outdated or incomplete. Medical information and techniques are constantly evolving, and this can cause confusion for patients who rely solely on chatbots for answers to their medical concerns.</p>
    <h2>The Risks</h2>
    <p>ChatGPT not only has a low rate of correct answers regarding clinical questions in urologic practice, but it also makes certain types of errors that pose a risk of spreading medical misinformation. Patients who turn to Chatbots for medical advice may put their health at risk by relying on inaccurate medical information. The medical community has concerns about the reliability of these AI-powered chatbots, especially when it comes to interpreting medical scan results and advising on appropriate treatments and medications.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, while AI-powered chatbots such as ChatGPT are a great way to quickly access medical information, they are not a substitute for in-person medical advice from certified medical practitioners. Patients should always consult their urologist or other qualified medical professionals for a personal and thorough examination and consultation to receive accurate medical advice. Using chatbots or online medical information without consulting a trained healthcare professional can be risky and may lead to inaccurate information, incorrect diagnosis, wrong treatments and in some cases severe health risks.</p>
