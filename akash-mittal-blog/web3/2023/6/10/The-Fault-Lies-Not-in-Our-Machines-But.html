  <p>During a recent show-cause hearing for two attorneys and their firm, ChatGPT was brought forward as the culprit of submitting fake citations and even more fictitious cases to federal court. However, is the fault really in our machines, or is it ultimately in the hands of the individuals who abuse them?</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One example of this is the recent controversy surrounding deepfakes, where technology is used to manipulate images and videos to create highly convincing but entirely fake content. While it may be tempting to simply point the finger at the technology used, it is ultimately individuals who create and use these deepfakes for sinister purposes.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Similarly, the use of algorithms in decision-making processes has also been called into question. It is easy to blame the machines when an algorithmic decision results in bias or discrimination, but it is ultimately the individuals who design and implement these algorithms who are responsible for any negative outcomes.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>It is important to remember that machines are simply tools that can be used for good or bad. It is the individuals who wield these tools that must be held accountable for their actions. This means taking responsibility for any negative consequences that arise from the misuse or abuse of technology.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, while it may be easy to point the finger at technology when things go wrong, the true fault lies with individuals who abuse and misuse these tools. It is important to hold these individuals accountable and to take action to prevent future misuse and abuse.</p>
