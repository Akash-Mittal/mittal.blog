   <h5>A Story on How Generative AI is Changing Our World</h5>
  </header>
  <main>
   <section>
    <p>It was a typical Monday morning in the city of New York. Joe was on his office commute, walking to catch the subway train. Just as he reached the station, his smartphone beeped. It was a notification from his home automation system, welcoming him for another seamless day ahead.</p>
    <p>Joyously, Joe clicked on the notification and remotely switched off the lights and turned on the coffee maker. As he entered the train, he realized how much his life had changed, all thanks to Generative AI.</p>
    <p>Generative AI is Artificial Intelligence that enables a machine to learn from a given dataset and generate something new. It is a rapidly growing field that holds endless possibilities of transforming every sphere of the human world.</p>

    <h2>What is Generative AI?</h2>
    <p>Generative AI is a part of machine learning that focuses on teaching a machine to create something new based on a pre-existing model. It has the ability to generate images, music, text, and even entire videos on its own.</p>
    <p>Generative models are trained on a given dataset and use that data to generate new examples that are similar to what it has learned. It is an algorithmic approach to ML that has the ability to create something new and unique, without the need for human intervention.</p>
    <p>Generative AI can be achieved through a variety of techniques such as Variational Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks, and Transformers.</p>

   <section>
    <h2>Why is Generative AI Important?</h2>
    <p>Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize every aspect of human life, from healthcare to design and entertainment. It is a disruptive technology that can unlock endless possibilities and create entirely new industries.</p>
    <p>Generative AI can be used to develop personalized medicine by analyzing a patient's unique genetic makeup and creating customized drugs. It can also be used in fashion to create unique clothing designs, or in film production to generate realistic CGI.</p>
    <p>Moreover, Generative AI can help us create more sustainable cities by analyzing and generating optimized urban plans that take into account factors such as emissions, traffic, and more.</p>

    <h2>Opportunities Unlocked by Generative AI</h2>
    <p>The possibilities unlocked by Generative AI are limitless. Here are just a few examples:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Creating new and unique music, art, and literature</li>
     <li>Generating realistic virtual avatars for online gaming or social media</li>
     <li>Developing smart homes that can learn and adjust to individual preferences</li>
     <li>Improving self-driving cars by generating more accurate navigation</li>
     <li>Creating personalized learning experiences for students</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are just a few examples of the many opportunities unlocked by Generative AI. As the technology continues to evolve, the possibilities will only grow, and many new industries and job roles are likely to emerge.</p>

   <section>
    <h2>Types of Generative AI</h2>
    <p>Here are three of the most popular types of Generative AI:</p>
    <ol>
     <li><strong>Variational Autoencoders (VAE):</strong> VAE is used to generate new data that is similar to what it has learned from a dataset. It achieves this through a two-part neural network, one for encoding the input data and the other for decoding the generated data.</li>
     <li><strong>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):</strong> GANs consist of two neural networks, one that generates data and the other that discriminates it as real or fake. The two networks are trained together to create a generator that produces realistic data.</li>
     <li><strong>Transformers:</strong> Transformers are a type of neural network that is mainly used in natural language processing to generate realistic text. They use attention mechanisms to learn from the input data and generate text that is contextually accurate.</li>
    </ol>
