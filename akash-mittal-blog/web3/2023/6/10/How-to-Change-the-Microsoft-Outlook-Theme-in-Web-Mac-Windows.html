   <h2>Changing the Theme</h2>
   <p>Before we get started, let me share with you a personal story. For years, I used the default blue theme on my Outlook account. It was functional, but boring. One day, I scrolled through the settings and discovered the theme options. I was thrilled to learn I could choose from a variety of colors and designs. I selected the green theme and felt a sense of joy every time I opened an email. It may seem like a small change, but it truly makes a difference in my Outlook experience.</p>
   <p>Now, let's get to the how-to part. The steps to change the theme may vary slightly depending on whether you're using Outlook on the web, Mac, or Windows. Here are the general guidelines for each platform:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Outlook on the Web:</strong> Go to <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Theme</em> and select your desired theme.</li>
    <li><strong>Outlook for Mac:</strong> Go to <em>Preferences</em> &gt; <em>General</em> &gt; <em>Personalize</em> and select your desired theme.</li>
    <li><strong>Outlook for Windows:</strong> Go to <em>File</em> &gt; <em>Options</em> &gt; <em>General</em> &gt; <em>Office Theme</em> and select your desired theme.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Once you've made your selection, save your changes and voila! You now have a customized version of Outlook that reflects your personal style.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Themes</h2>
   <p>Not sure which theme to choose? Here are some examples of the themes available:</p>

    <li><strong>White:</strong> A classic, clean theme that is easy on the eyes and perfect for those who prefer simplicity.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Of course, these are just a few examples. Feel free to explore the full range of Outlook themes and find the one that best suits your needs.</p>
