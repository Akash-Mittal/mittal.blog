    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>It was a beautiful sunny day, and I was enjoying my day off by taking a walk in the park. Suddenly, I heard a rumble of thunder in the distance. At first, I thought it was just a passing cloud, but soon dark clouds started to cover the sky. As I walked back home, the first drops of rain started to fall, and by the time I got home, it was pouring heavily. I quickly checked the weather forecast, and to my surprise, there was a low-pressure system expected to bring heavy rain, thunderstorms, and gusty winds for the next few days.</p>

The heavy rain, hail, lightning, and gusty winds may cause flash floods, power outages, and damage to property. It's important to stay informed about the weather conditions in your area by checking the local forecast frequently.</p>
    <p>Next week, the weather is expected to be generally drier and warmer, but still unsettled. It's a good idea to be prepared by having an emergency kit and making sure your home is in good condition to withstand potential storms.</p>
    <p>It's important to remember that even if you're not directly impacted by the storm, it can still affect your daily life. The storm may cause delays in transportation, power outages, and disruptions in daily routines.</p>
