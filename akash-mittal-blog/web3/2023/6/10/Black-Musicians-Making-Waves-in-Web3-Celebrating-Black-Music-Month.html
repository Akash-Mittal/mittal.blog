   <p>In honor of Black Music Month, we take a look at the artists who are making their mark in Web3. From NFTs to virtual concerts, these musicians are ahead of the game when it comes to exploring the possibilities of blockchain technology and the metaverse.</p>
   <h2>The Future of Music is Interactive</h2>
   <p>For decades, music has been a passive form of entertainment. We listen to it, sing along, and dance to it, but we don't really interact with it in a meaningful way. This is changing with Web3, where musicians can create immersive experiences that go beyond the traditional concert or album launch.</p>
