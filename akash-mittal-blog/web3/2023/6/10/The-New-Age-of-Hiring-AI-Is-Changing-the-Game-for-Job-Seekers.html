    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>John graduated with a degree in computer science and started searching for his dream job. He was confident that his skills and experience would land him a great job, but soon realized that the hiring process had changed drastically since he had last looked for a job.</p>
    <p>Now, companies were using algorithms and machine learning to sort through resumes and cover letters automatically. This meant that John's application might not even be seen by a human if it didn't pass the initial screening process. He was frustrated and didn't know how to compete with the rise of robots.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>John's experience is not unique. In fact, many job seekers are facing the same challenge in a world where AI is changing the game for recruitment and hiring. However, there are ways to skill up and succeed in this new landscape.</p>
    <h3>Example 1: Focus on Your Skills</h3>
    <p>Companies are looking for candidates who have specific skills and experience. Instead of including irrelevant information on your resume and cover letter, focus on the skills that are relevant to the job you are applying for. Use targeted keywords and phrases to increase the chances of your application making it through the initial screening process.</p>
    <h3>Example 2: Learn New Technologies</h3>
    <p>AI, automation, and machine learning are not just changing the hiring processâ€”they are also changing the job market itself. To compete with the rise of robots, job seekers need to be constantly learning new technologies and skills. This will not only make you more marketable but also increase your chances of success in the future.</p>
    <h3>Example 3: Network and Build Relationships</h3>
    <p>Despite the rise of AI, human interactions still matter when it comes to finding a job. Networking and building relationships with people in your industry can open doors and lead to new opportunities. Attend industry events, join online forums, and connect with professionals on social media to expand your network.</p>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <h3>Tip 1: Customize Your Application for Each Job</h3>
    <p>While it may be tempting to submit the same application to multiple job postings, this strategy is unlikely to be successful in a world where AI is screening resumes and cover letters. Customize your application for each job by using keywords and phrases from the job posting, highlighting your relevant skills and experience, and tailoring your cover letter to the specific company and position.</p>
    <h3>Tip 2: Stay up-to-date with new Technologies and Trends</h3>
    <p>To stay competitive and increase your chances of success, it's important to stay up-to-date with new technologies and trends in your industry. Subscribe to industry publications, attend conferences and seminars, and take online courses to keep your skills sharp.</p>
    <h3>Tip 3: Be Prepared for Video Interviews</h3>
    <p>With the rise of remote work, video interviews are becoming more common. Make sure you are prepared by testing your equipment, dressing professionally, and practicing your interview skills. Treat the interview as if it were in person and make sure you present yourself in the best possible light.</p>
