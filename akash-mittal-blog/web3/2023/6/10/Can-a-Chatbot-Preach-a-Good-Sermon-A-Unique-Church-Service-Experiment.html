    <h3>The Story: ChatGPT's Church Service in Bavaria</h3>
    <p>Hundreds of German Protestants gathered for a unique church service in the Bavarian towns of Nuernberg and Fuerth. The service was generated almost entirely by artificial intelligence, created by ChatGPT and Jonas Simmerlein, a theologian and philosopher from the University of Vienna.</p>
    <p>One of the highlights of the event, the ChatGPT chatbot was personified by different avatars on a huge screen above the altar, leading the over 300 attendees through 40 minutes of prayer, music, sermons and blessings. The event drew an immense interest, with people forming a long queue outside the building an hour before it began.</p>
