  <p>There was a time when traditional financial institutions held the monopoly on financial services. However, the emergence of blockchain technology has led to the creation of decentralized financial systems, commonly known as Web3 Finance. These systems use blockchain technology to offer innovative financial solutions to users worldwide.</p>
  <p>The NEAR Foundation is a decentralized platform that is focused on creating an open, transparent, and scalable infrastructure for Web3 Finance. Mirae Asset Securities is a leading asset management and securities firm in Asia that has been at the forefront of innovation in the financial industry. Recently, the two announced a strategic partnership that aims to leverage the strengths of both of these organizations to create a more robust Web3 Finance ecosystem.</p>
