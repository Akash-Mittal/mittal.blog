  <p>It was a hot afternoon in Singapore when Rebecca was driving around the city, looking for a new apartment. She had just landed a job at a local tech firm and needed a place to live. As she stopped at a red light, she checked her phone and saw a notification from her virtual assistant, Sarah.</p>

  <p>"Hi Rebecca, I've found a great apartment for you. It's a newly renovated two-bedroom unit in a prime location. The rent is within your budget, and the landlord has great reviews. Would you like me to book a viewing for you?" Sarah said.</p>
  <p>Rebecca was amazed by how accurate and efficient Sarah was. She had been using the virtual assistant for a few months now, and it had helped her with everything from scheduling meetings to ordering food. But this was the first time Sarah had recommended an apartment for her. It was clear that AI was disrupting the property industry in Asia, and it was just the beginning.</p>
  <h2>How AI is Changing the Property Industry</h2>
  <p>The use of AI in the property industry is not new. In fact, some companies have been using it for years to speed up the property search process and provide personalized recommendations to clients. However, the recent advancements in machine learning and natural language processing have made AI even more effective and efficient.</p>
  <h3>1. Personalized Recommendations</h3>
  <p>One of the most significant advantages of AI in the property industry is its ability to provide personalized recommendations to clients. By analyzing data such as client preferences, search history, and budget, AI-powered platforms can suggest properties that match their needs and preferences.</p>
  <p>For example, PropertyGuru, a leading property platform in Southeast Asia, has been using AI to provide personalized recommendations to its users. Its AI-powered feature, "My Home," recommends properties based on the user's search history and behavior. The platform claims that this feature has increased user engagement by 40%.</p>
  <h3>2. Improved Efficiency</h3>
  <p>Another advantage of AI in the property industry is its ability to improve efficiency. Traditionally, property searches involve a lot of manual work, such as browsing through listings and contacting agents. With AI, much of this work can be automated, saving time and resources.</p>
  <p>For instance, 99.co, a Singaporean property portal, has been using AI to speed up the property search process. Its AI-powered chatbot, "Ask Guru," can answer users' questions and provide them with property recommendations in real-time. This has reduced the time spent by agents in responding to queries and allowed them to focus on more complex tasks.</p>
  <h3>3. Changing Role of Agents</h3>
  <p>While AI is making property searches more efficient and personalized, it is also changing the role of agents. With AI taking care of many of the routine tasks, agents will need to focus on providing more value-added services, such as negotiating deals and providing expert advice.</p>
  <p>In fact, some companies are already experimenting with AI-powered agents. Japanese real estate firm, Daito Trust Construction, has introduced an AI-powered chatbot agent, "Reji." It can answer clients' questions, provide them with property recommendations, and even schedule viewings. While Reji is still in its early stages, it could be a sign of things to come.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>AI is disrupting the property industry in Asia, and it is only the beginning. With its ability to provide personalized recommendations, improve efficiency, and change the role of agents, AI is poised to transform the property industry in the years to come. While AI-powered agents may still be in the realm of science fiction, they are not too far away.</p>
