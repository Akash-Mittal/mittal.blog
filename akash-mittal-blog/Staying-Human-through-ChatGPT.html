    <p>It was 11 PM and Sarah, a working mother, was struggling to put her baby to sleep. But as soon as she was about to fall asleep, a thought struck her mind. She had to finish an important presentation which was due the next morning. She picked up her phone and opened her laptop to start working.</p>
    <p>As she typed the first few words, her phone beeped. It was a message from ChatGPT, an AI powered messaging app. She had installed it a few weeks ago to help her with scheduling her tasks. She opened the message and it read,</p>
    <blockquote>
     "Hey Sarah, you mentioned about a presentation due tomorrow. Do you need any help with it? I can suggest some points which can save you time."
    </blockquote>
    <p>Sarah was surprised. How did ChatGPT know about her presentation? She replied, "Yes, please. I'm running out of time."</p>
    <p>ChatGPT started suggesting some insights based on Sarah's previous work and the relevance of the topic. Within an hour, she was able to complete her presentation, and also got some great feedback from her colleagues. She went to bed content, knowing that ChatGPT saved her time and helped her complete the task with perfection.</p><!-- Real Life Examples -->
