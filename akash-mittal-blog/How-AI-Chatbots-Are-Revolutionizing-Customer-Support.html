  <p>Sarah had been working with a leading ecommerce store for over a year now. She was appreciated for her customer support services and had resolved more than 700 customer queries in the last quarter. However, lately, she had been feeling overwhelmed with the increasing number of customers and their queries. That�??s when the store owners introduced her to an AI chatbot that would handle repetitive queries and help her focus on more complex customer issues. Sarah was skeptical at first, but the results were amazing. With the AI chatbot, she was able to handle customer queries more efficiently without compromising on quality.</p>
