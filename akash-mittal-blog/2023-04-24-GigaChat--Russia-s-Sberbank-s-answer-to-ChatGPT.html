   <p>Have you ever had that feeling when you're chatting with a bot and you're not really sure if itâ€™s a human or a machine responding to your messages? With recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, it's becoming more and more common to encounter these chatbots, and it's sometimes difficult to differentiate between a bot and a human.</p>
   <p>Recently, Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, released GigaChat, its new AI-driven chatbot platform that is set to rival ChatGPT, one of the most popular chatbot platforms globally.</p>
   <p>But why should we care about two chatbot platforms? Why is this news significant? Let's dive deep into the world of chatbot technology and explore why GigaChat has the potential to disrupt the chatbot market.</p>
   <h2>From ChatGPT to GigaChat: A Brief History of Chatbots</h2>
   <p>The concept of chatbots is not new, and they have been around for a while. The first chatbot was created in the late '60s, and since then, it has undergone several iterations to become the advanced AI-driven chatbots that we see today.</p>
   <p>Chatbots are becoming increasingly popular because they help businesses automate repetitive tasks and offer improved customer experiences by providing 24/7 assistance. Chatbots can also personalize conversations with users by understanding their intent and preferences.</p>
   <h2>Concrete Examples: Chatbots at Work</h2>
   <p>Let's take a look at some real-world examples of chatbots at work:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Banking:</strong> GigaChat's predecessor, Sberbank's chatbot, interacts with customers via messaging apps to provide assistance with banking transactions, like opening accounts, checking balances, or applying for loans.</li>
    <li><strong>Retail:</strong> H&amp;M's chatbot, Kik, asks users for their preferred style and then suggests outfits that match their preferences.</li>
    <li><strong>Hospitality:</strong> Marriott's chatbot helps travelers with booking flights, hotels, and rental cars, also providing personalized recommendations based on their travel history.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>What Makes GigaChat Stand Out?</h2>
   <p>So, what sets GigaChat apart from other chatbot platforms like ChatGPT?</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Natural Language Processing:</strong> GigaChat boasts industry-leading natural language processing (NLP) capabilities, meaning it can understand complex queries and respond in a conversational style.</li>
    <li><strong>Security:</strong> Sberbank is a leading financial institution with a reputation for security and trust. GigaChat reinforces this by encrypting sensitive data and providing multi-factor authentication to ensure that customer data remains secure.</li>
    <li><strong>Customizable:</strong> GigaChat allows businesses to customize the chatbot to suit their specific needs by tailoring the bot's personality to match their brand and modifying the bot's capabilities to meet their business objectives.</li>
   </ul>
