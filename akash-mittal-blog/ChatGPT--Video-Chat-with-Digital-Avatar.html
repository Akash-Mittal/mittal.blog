   <p>Once upon a time, video calling was a luxury for most people. Apart from the high cost, the technology was often complicated to use and required a strong internet connection. But, thanks to the advances in technology, video calling is now easily accessible to millions of people around the world. And, with ChatGPT-powered digital avatars, video calls have become a lot more fun and engaging.</p>
   <p>ChatGPT is an AI-enabled chatbot that can be embedded in various chat platforms and used for a range of purposes, including customer service, lead generation, and personalized marketing. Recently, ChatGPT has introduced a new feature that allows users to create a digital avatar that represents them in video calls. An iPhone app has been released, which enables users to video chat with their ChatGPT-powered digital avatar.</p>
   <p>One of the main advantages of using a digital avatar in video calls is that it reduces the pressure on the users to present themselves in a certain way. For example, people who are self-conscious about their appearance can choose to use their avatar in video calls and still communicate effectively with others.</p>
   <p>Real-life examples of ChatGPT-powered digital avatars being used in video calls include:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>A salesperson using their digital avatar to conduct a video call with a potential customer. The avatar can be customized to fit the brand and personality of the salesperson, making the call more engaging and memorable.</li>
    <li>A student using their digital avatar to participate in an online class. The animated avatar can help the student feel more present and involved in the class than if they were just a face on a screen.</li>
    <li>A gamer using their digital avatar to stream gameplay and interact with their fans. The avatar allows the gamer to create a stronger brand identity and connect with their audience in a more personal way.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The iPhone app that enables video calling with ChatGPT-powered digital avatars has been developed by AvatarMe, a startup that specializes in creating personalized digital experiences. The app is free to download and use, and it can be integrated with various video calling platforms such as Zoom, Skype, and FaceTime.</p>
   <p>Another company that is working on similar technology is Soul Machines, a New Zealand-based startup that creates hyper-realistic digital avatars for a range of applications, including customer service and education. The company has partnered with a number of major corporations, including Mercedes-Benz and Royal Bank of Scotland, to provide personalized and engaging customer experiences using their avatars.</p>
   <p>In summary, ChatGPT-powered digital avatars are a great way to add a new dimension to video calling. By allowing users to create custom avatars that represent them in video calls, ChatGPT is making video calling more accessible and engaging for everyone.</p>
