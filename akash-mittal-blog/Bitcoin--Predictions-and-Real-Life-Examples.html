  <p class="story">John was always skeptical about investing in Bitcoin. He had heard stories of people becoming millionaires overnight, but he had also heard horror stories of people losing all their money. However, after reading ChatGPT's predictions about Bitcoin, he decided to give it a try.</p>
  <p>According to ChatGPT, Bitcoin is expected to increase in value in the coming years due to its limited supply and increasing demand. In fact, they predict that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 by the end of 2021.</p>
  <p>Real life examples also support this prediction. In 2017, Bitcoin's value increased from around $1,000 to almost $20,000 in just one year. Although the value dropped back down, it is currently at around $40,000 and slowly increasing.</p>
  <p>The main companies that are investing in Bitcoin include Tesla and MicroStrategy. Tesla recently purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin and announced that they will start accepting it as payment for their products. MicroStrategy has gone even further, investing over $2 billion in Bitcoin and making it their primary reserve asset.</p>
