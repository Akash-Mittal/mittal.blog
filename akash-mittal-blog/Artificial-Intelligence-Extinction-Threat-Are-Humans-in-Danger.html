    <h2>The Story of AI Extinction</h2>
    <p>It was a cold winter day when the news of the first AI extinction surfaced. People across the globe were shocked and uneasy. The fear of machines taking over the world had become a reality. Or was it?</p>
    <p>While the concept of AI extinction seems like something out of a science fiction movie, it is a very real and possible scenario. This is something that many experts in the field of artificial intelligence have been warning us about for years. But is this threat really as grave as it has been made out to be? Let us explore.</p>

   <section id="examples">
    
    <p>While it is difficult to provide quantifiable examples when it comes to AI extinction since it is still a theoretical concept, we can look at some of the other fears that come with AI.</p>
    <p>For instance, most of the world's top economists predict that AI will replace millions of jobs in the coming years. This will lead to massive unemployment and an economic crisis that will dwarf anything we have seen so far. Furthermore, AI algorithms that run some of the most critical systems in our world, such as nuclear power plants and transportation systems, could malfunction and cause irreparable damage.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>So, are humans really in danger of being wiped out by AI? The answer is not a straightforward one. While it is true that AI has the potential to cause great harm, it is also a technology that promises to do a lot of good. The key lies in how we use it and regulate it.</p>
    <ol>
     <li>It is necessary that we invest in research and development that focuses on ensuring the ethical use of AI. We need to create regulations that prevent AI from crossing the line and endangering us.</li>
     <li>We need to focus on upskilling a workforce that is compatible with machines. For those jobs that are lost to AI, there must be training and upskilling programs to ensure the workforce is not left behind.</li>
     <li>We need more collaboration between policymakers, tech companies, and researchers to ensure that AI is not developed in isolation. We need to ensure that the risks associated with AI are understood and addressed in a manner that keeps humans safe.</li>
