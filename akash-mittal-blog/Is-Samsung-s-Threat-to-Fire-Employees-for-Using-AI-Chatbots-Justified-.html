    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>Recently, Samsung has made headlines for its threat to fire employees who use AI chatbots like ChatGPT. The company claims that these chatbots, which are designed to assist customers or provide information, are a security risk, as they could potentially leak confidential information through conversations.</p>
    <p>However, many employees argue that these chatbots are a valuable tool for their work and that they have not seen evidence of any security breaches. They believe that Samsung's threat is an overreaction and that the company should trust its employees to use discretion when interacting with customers.</p>

    <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
    <p>Samsung is not the only company grappling with the use of AI chatbots in the workplace. Many companies are implementing these tools to help with customer service, sales, and even internal communication. Here are some examples:</p>
    <ul>
