  <p>Summer is here and many families are spending time by the pool. Swimming is a fun and healthy activity, but it also comes with a risk. As a swim instructor for over 10 years, I have seen many pool accidents caused by the same deadly mistake.</p>
  <h2>The Mistake</h2>
  <p>The mistake that I'm talking about is leaving children unattended in or near the pool. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, drowning is the leading cause of death for children between the ages of 1 and 4, and most of these incidents happen in residential swimming pools.</p>
  <p>Many parents believe that they can keep an eye on their children while doing other things, but it only takes a few seconds for a child to drown. Drowning is silent and can happen even if the child knows how to swim. Children can also slip and fall into the pool accidentally.</p>
  <p>Leaving children unattended in or near the pool is not only dangerous, but it's also illegal. In many states, including New York, parents can be charged with neglect or endangerment if their child is found unattended in a pool.</p>
  <h2>The Consequences</h2>
  <p>The consequences of leaving children unattended in or near the pool can be devastating. In addition to death, drowning can cause brain damage and other long-term disabilities. Even if the child survives, the emotional trauma can last a lifetime.</p>
  <p>Moreover, pool accidents can lead to expensive medical bills and legal fees. Insurance may not cover these expenses if it's found that the parents were negligent in supervising their children.</p>
  <p>Here are some quantifiable examples:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>From 2005-2014, there were an average of 3,536 fatal unintentional drownings (non-boating related) annually in the United States.</li>
   <li>About one in five people who die from drowning are children 14 and younger.</li>
   <li>For every child who dies from drowning, another five receive emergency department care for nonfatal submersion injuries.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What Parents Can Do</h2>
  <p>Parents can take steps to prevent pool accidents and keep their children safe. Here are some practical tips:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Never leave children unattended in or near the pool, even if they know how to swim.</li>
   <li>Keep pool gates locked and secured to prevent children from entering the pool area without supervision.</li>
   <li>Enroll children in swimming lessons and teach them basic water safety skills.</li>
   <li>Learn CPR and first aid so you can respond quickly in case of an emergency.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, leaving children unattended in or near the pool is a deadly mistake that can put kids at risk. Drowning is the leading cause of death for children between the ages of 1 and 4, but it can be prevented if parents take the necessary precautions. Remember to always supervise your children around the pool, keep the area secured, and learn CPR and first aid.</p>
