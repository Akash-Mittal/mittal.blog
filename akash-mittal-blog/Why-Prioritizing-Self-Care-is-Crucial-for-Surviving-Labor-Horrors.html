    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>Six months ago, I started working at a new job that I thought was going to be amazing. The pay was good, and the work was challenging. However, a few months into the job, I found myself working overtime several times a week, barely sleeping, and constantly feeling overwhelmed.</p>
    <p>A few months into the job, I was rushed to the hospital due to extreme exhaustion. The doctor told me that I had to take a few weeks off work and prioritize my health. It was during those weeks of recuperation that I realized just how important self care was. I learned several ways of taking care of myself, and since then, I have not been back to the hospital.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, my experience is all too common, and labor horror stories are becoming more and more frequent. People are working themselves to the bone, and the consequences are disastrous.</p>

    <h2>Why Self Care is Important</h2>
    <h3>First Point: Mental Health</h3>
    <p>If you do not prioritize your mental health and self-care, you will eventually burn out. When this happens, you will find yourself unable to focus, become irritable, and lose motivation. These symptoms can lead to depression and anxiety which in turn affect your work, social life, and relationships.</p>
    <h3>Second Point: Physical Health</h3>
    <p>Health is wealth, and it is only when you are healthy that you can accomplish your goals. People who do not prioritize self-care often find themselves suffering from physical health issues, including migraines, high blood pressure, and heart disease. You must take care of your body just as much as your mind.</p>
    <h3>Third Point: Work-life Balance</h3>
    <p>Work-life balance is crucial, and the only way to achieve this is by taking care of yourself. Prioritizing self-care means setting boundaries and learning to say no to tasks and projects that do not align with your goals. This helps you to focus on the things that matter, like spending time with your loved ones, pursuing your hobbies, and taking care of your everyday needs.</p>
