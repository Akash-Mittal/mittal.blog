  <h3>1. Travel Tray</h3>
  <p>When you're on the road, it can be tough to keep your kids entertained and occupied. That's why a travel tray is a must-have for any parent. A travel tray is a portable table that attaches to your child's car seat, providing a flat surface for them to play, eat, or do activities on. With a travel tray, your child can play with their toys, color, or read a book, all while being securely strapped into their car seat.</p>

  <p>Quantifiable example: The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NXYRJDW">Munchkin Snack Catcher</a> is a popular snack container with over 10,000 reviews on Amazon and a 4.7-star rating.</p>
  <h3>3. Portable Charger</h3>
  <p>Whether you're using your phone for GPS or your kids are playing games on their tablets, having a dead device can quickly turn a fun road trip into a nightmare. A portable charger is a must-have for any parent on the go.</p>
