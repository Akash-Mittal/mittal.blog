    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>Have you ever wondered how chatbots can talk to you as if they were human? Or how a language model can generate coherent and relevant text? It all comes down to the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP). And at the forefront of this field is OpenAI, an AI research lab that aims to advance AI in a safe and beneficial way.</p>
    <p>OpenAI offers a multitude of powerful tools and APIs, one of which is ChatGPT, a language model that can generate human-like text based on the input it receives. With ChatGPT, you can build chatbots, generate captions, summarize text, and more. But how do you get started?</p>
    <p>That's where the Free ChatGPT Course comes in. Created by OpenAI developers, it offers a step-by-step guide to using ChatGPT for coding 5 projects. Each project teaches you a new skill and showcases the potential of ChatGPT.</p>

    <ul>
     <li>Project 1: Introduction to ChatGPT – Understand how ChatGPT works and generate your first text using the API.</li>
     <li>Project 2: Sentiment Analysis – Learn how to use ChatGPT to analyze the sentiment of a piece of text and categorize it as positive, negative, or neutral.</li>
     <li>Project 3: Text Summarization – Build a tool that can summarize large articles or documents into a few key sentences, using ChatGPT to generate the summary.</li>
     <li>Project 4: Question Answering – Train ChatGPT to answer questions based on a given passage of text, such as in a quiz or trivia game.</li>
     <li>Project 5: Chatbot – Build a chatbot that can answer user questions, engage in conversation, and provide helpful information, all powered by ChatGPT.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By the end of the course, you will have a solid understanding of how ChatGPT works and how it can be used to create a variety of useful and engaging tools. Plus, you'll have a portfolio of projects to show off your skills to potential employers or clients.</p>
