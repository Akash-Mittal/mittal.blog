   <p>It's no secret that the state of Texas is known for its love of barbeque. People travel from all over the world to taste the succulent smoked meats that seem to be on every street corner. But one family in Houston has found success in a business that goes against the grain: tofu.</p>
   <h2>The Lee Family's Journey</h2>
   <p>The Lee family has owned a small restaurant in the heart of Houston for over twenty years. Originally from Taiwan, they came to the United States with dreams of owning their own business. The restaurant started out serving traditional Taiwanese dishes, but they quickly realized that they needed to add a few more items to the menu to appeal to a wider audience. That's when they decided to try making their own tofu.</p>
   <p>At first, it was just a side dish that they served to customers who requested it. But word quickly spread about the Lee family's homemade tofu, and soon people were coming from all over the city to try it. Encouraged by this success, the family decided to make tofu their main focus and opened a tofu manufacturing facility in a nearby suburb.</p>
   <h2>The Unexpected Success of Tofu in Texas</h2>
   <p>Some people might think that trying to sell tofu in a state known for its meat would be a recipe for disaster. But the Lee family has found that there is a demand for healthy, plant-based protein options even in the heart of barbeque country. In fact, their tofu is now sold in supermarkets throughout the state and has become a popular ingredient in many local restaurants.</p>
   <p>But it's not just vegetarians and health-conscious eaters who are buying the Lee family's tofu. They have also found success by marketing it as a unique and delicious ingredient to add to traditional barbeque dishes. The tofu can be marinated and grilled just like meat, and many people have discovered that it adds a new dimension of flavor to their favorite meals.</p>
   <h2>The Numbers Don't Lie</h2>
   <p>The Lee family's tofu business has seen impressive growth over the past few years. In 2016, they produced 50,000 pounds of tofu. In 2019, that number had more than doubled to 120,000 pounds. They now employ over 20 people and their tofu is sold in over 200 stores across Texas.</p>
   <p>The Lee family's success is not just a result of their delicious tofu. They have also been savvy in their marketing and branding efforts. They have a strong social media presence and have even collaborated with local chefs to create unique tofu dishes that have been featured in several food blogs and magazines.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The Lee family's story is a refreshing reminder that success can come from unexpected places. By staying true to their roots and taking a risk on a lesser-known product, they have created a business that is thriving in a competitive marketplace. Some of the key takeaways from their story include:</p>
