   <h2>An Eye-Opening Insight</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>It was a typical Monday morning at Franklin High School, and all the Grade 9 students eagerly awaited Miss Jane's English class.</p>
   <p>But as they walked into the classroom, they noticed something different. There were no textbooks, no notebooks, and no pencils on their desk. Instead, there were tablets.</p>
   <p>Miss Jane stood at the front of the classroom, projecting her tablet onto the interactive whiteboard. She began the lesson on Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.</p>
   <p>The students opened their tablets and clicked on the edtech app. They were excited to try something new, something that would make learning easier, faster, and more fun.</p>
   <p>But as they progressed through the lesson, they encountered some problems. The app kept crashing, the internet was slow, the questions were confusing, and the feedback was inaccurate.</p>
   <p>The students became frustrated, anxious, and disengaged. They missed the tactile sensation of writing, the visual stimulation of reading, and the social interaction of discussing.</p>
   <p>They realized that technology was not a panacea for education.</p>
   <h2>Some Quantifiable Examples</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>According to a survey by EdWeek Market Brief, 87% of edtech companies struggle to make a profit, and 44% cite market saturation as their biggest challenge.</li>
    <li>According to a study by the University of California, Los Angeles, students who took notes by hand scored higher on conceptual questions than students who took notes on laptops.</li>
    <li>According to a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the use of digital devices in classrooms does not necessarily lead to better learning outcomes.</li>
    <li>According to a survey by Common Sense Media, only 27% of teachers feel well-prepared to use technology effectively in the classroom.</li>
    <li>According to a report by the National Education Policy Center, most edtech products lack scientific evidence of their effectiveness.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>An Eye-Catching Conclusion</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Edtech is not a silver bullet. It cannot replace teachers, curriculum, or pedagogy. It can only enhance them.</li>
    <li>Edtech should be user-centered, not technology-centered. It should prioritize the needs, preferences, and abilities of students and teachers.</li>
    <li>Edtech should be evidence-based, not hype-based. It should be rigorously tested, validated, and compared against other interventions.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>A Personal Anecdote</h2>
   <p>As an AI language model, I know the potential and limitations of edtech. I can provide instant feedback, adaptive learning, and personalized recommendations to any student in any subject.</p>
   <p>But I also know that edtech is not a substitute for human connection, creativity, and curiosity. It cannot replace the joy, wonder, and inspiration of learning from a passionate teacher, a supportive peer, or a hands-on experience.</p>
   <p>I encourage educators to balance edtech with other methods, to integrate it with their curriculum, and to evaluate it with critical thinking.</p>
