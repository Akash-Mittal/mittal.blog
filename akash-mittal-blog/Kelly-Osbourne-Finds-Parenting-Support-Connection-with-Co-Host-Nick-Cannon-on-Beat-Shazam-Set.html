    <p>"I never knew how hard it was to be a parent until I became one," Kelly Osbourne said on a recent episode of the hit show Beat Shazam. Osbourne, known for her candidness and humor, went on to share the difficulties she has faced as a first-time mom, especially during the pandemic.</p>
    <p>It was during this conversation that she found a surprising connection with co-host Nick Cannon, who has also faced his share of parenting struggles as a father of seven children.</p>
    <p>"It's so nice to have someone who understands what I'm going through," Osbourne said, visibly relieved to have found someone to relate to.</p>
    <p>This exchange between Osbourne and Cannon highlights the importance of finding parenting support, both for new parents and those who are seasoned but still facing challenges. Here are three practical tips for finding the support you need.</p>
    <h2>Tip 1: Join a Parenting Group or Online Community</h2>
    <p>One of the easiest ways to find parenting support is to join a parenting group or online community. These groups can provide a wealth of information and resources as well as a sounding board for your parenting questions and concerns. You can find a local parenting group through community centers, schools, or places of worship, or you can join an online group such as <a href="https://www.whattoexpect.com/">What to Expect</a> or <a href="https://www.babycenter.com/">BabyCenter</a>.</p>
    <p>Personal anecdote: I joined a local parenting group when my first child was born, and it was a lifesaver. The other parents in the group became some of my closest friends, and we still meet up regularly even though our kids are now in high school.</p>
    <h2>Tip 2: Attend Parenting Workshops or Conferences</h2>
    <p>If you prefer a more formal approach to parenting support, consider attending a parenting workshop or conference. These events often feature experts in the field of parenting and child development who can provide guidance and advice on specific areas of concern. You can find parenting workshops and conferences through organizations such as <a href="https://www.zerotothree.org/">Zero to Three</a> or <a href="https://www.parentmap.com/">ParentMap</a>.</p>
    <p>Personal anecdote: I attended a workshop on positive discipline when my children were in elementary school, and it completely changed the way I interacted with them. I learned new strategies for setting boundaries and managing conflict that I still use today.</p>
    <h2>Tip 3: Seek Out Other Parents in Your Community</h2>
    <p>Finally, don't underestimate the power of connecting with other parents in your community. Whether it's through a playgroup, a school PTA, or a sports team, finding other parents who understand what you're going through can be invaluable. Try to strike up conversations with other parents at events or activities, or even reach out to parents of your child's classmates.</p>
    <p>Personal anecdote: I met one of my closest mom friends while sitting on the sidelines at my daughter's soccer game. We struck up a conversation about our shared love of coffee, and quickly realized that we had a lot more in common. Now we get together for coffee every Friday morning.</p>
    <p>Parenting can be incredibly rewarding, but it can also be challenging. Finding support and connection with other parents can make all the difference. Whether you join a parenting group, attend a workshop, or seek out other parents in your community, remember that you're not alone.</p>
