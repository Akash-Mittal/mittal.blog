   <p>Chegg, the online education company, had been steadily gaining in popularity and value in the stock market. The company was seen as a major player in the e-learning space, especially during the pandemic when more students were learning from home. However, things took a turn for the worse when a new player entered the market, ChatGPT.</p>
   <p>The new company offered a unique approach to education. Using AI-powered chatbots, ChatGPT provided personalized assistance to students. This proved to be a hit with many, and soon Chegg started losing its market share.</p>
   <p>Chegg's stock prices plummeted, causing a panic among shareholders and investors. The CEO, Dan Rosensweig, was quick to respond. He promised to invest heavily in technology and innovation, with a particular focus on AI and machine learning.</p>
   <p>However, some analysts remained skeptical. They pointed out that Chegg had become complacent, relying too heavily on its existing technology and not keeping up with the constantly evolving market. Even with the promised investment, it remained to be seen if Chegg could catch up with ChatGPT.</p>
   <p>Real life examples further highlighted Chegg's struggle to retain its market share. One student, Jessica, had been using Chegg's services for over a year. However, she recently switched to ChatGPT and found the experience to be much more engaging and useful. Another student, Nick, had not heard of ChatGPT until his friend recommended it to him and he found it to be a gamechanger in his studies.</p>
   <p>While the future of Chegg remains uncertain, one thing is clear - the e-learning market is constantly evolving and those who do not innovate and keep up with the pace will be left behind.</p>
