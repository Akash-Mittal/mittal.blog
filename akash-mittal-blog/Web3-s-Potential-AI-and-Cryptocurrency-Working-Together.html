     <h2>The Journey of Bob</h2>
     <p>Bob was a traditional farmer who lived in a remote area where life was tough. He had heard about Web3 technologies that could change his life, but he didn't know where to start. One day, a charity organization visited his village and brought an AI-powered drone that could help him monitor his crops and use data to make informed decisions. The organization also introduced him to a new cryptocurrency that could help him access a global market and earn a fair price for his products. Bob was amazed by the possibilities and decided to try it out.</p>

    <section id="examples">
     <h2>Real Life Examples</h2>
     <p>Bob's story is not unique. There are many real-life examples of how AI and cryptocurrency can work together to realise the potential of Web3. For instance, Unsplash, a popular photography platform, uses AI to curate and organize its vast collection of images. It also rewards photographers with its own cryptocurrency, which can be used to buy premium features or exchanged for other cryptocurrencies. This incentivizes photographers to upload more high-quality images and creates a self-sustaining ecosystem.</p>
     <p>Another example is Numerai, a hedge fund that uses AI to make investment decisions. Its own cryptocurrency is used to incentivize data scientists to build better predictive models that can beat the market. The fund benefits from the accuracy of these models and rewards the scientists with its cryptocurrency, which can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies or fiat currency.</p>
