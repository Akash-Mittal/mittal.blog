   <p>A decade ago, the crypto industry emerged with Bitcoin, the world's first cryptocurrency, which was intended to replace traditional fiat currency. Since then, the industry has evolved rapidly, with new projects and technologies emerging regularly. Today, Web3 is on the cusp of transforming the way we interact with online applications and services, with blockchain technology underpinning the new ecosystem.</p>
   <p>But despite its potential, Web3 has stagnated in terms of M&amp;A activity. This has led to concern among investors, founders, and entrepreneurs about the growth of the industry and its future. However, the recent Ripple deal may be about to change that.</p>
