  <p></p>
  <p>It was a beautiful summer day, and I was lounging by the pool with a cold drink in my hand. I could feel the sun warming my skin, and I took a deep breath, feeling completely relaxed and content. And then my phone buzzed. It was my husband, calling to check in.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>"How are the kids?" he asked.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>"They're fine," I replied. "I miss them, though."</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>It was a lie, and we both knew it. I didn't miss my kids at all. In fact, I was reveling in the silence and the freedom of not having to constantly monitor their every move.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>As we hung up, I felt a pang of guilt. Isn't it supposed to be the other way around? Aren't parents supposed to long to be with their children, and feel empty and incomplete when they're not?</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>But the truth is, I really do love my kids. They are the center of my world, and I would do anything for them. But sometimes, being away from them is pure bliss.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>It's not that I don't enjoy spending time with them. I do. But parenting is hard work, and anyone who tells you differently is lying. It's a 24/7 job with no time off, no sick days, and no vacation time. And sometimes, you just need a break.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>There's a lot of pressure on parents to be perfect these days. We're supposed to be endlessly patient, endlessly loving, endlessly selfless. We're supposed to put our children's needs before our own, all the time. And while that's a lofty goal, it's not always possible.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Parents are human, too. We get tired, we get cranky, we get overwhelmed. And sometimes, we just need a little time to ourselves. That's not a bad thing. In fact, it's healthy.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>When you're constantly putting your kids' needs first, it's easy to lose sight of your own. You forget what it's like to be a person with interests, goals, and desires that have nothing to do with raising children.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>So, what does "time away" look like for me? It can be as simple as going for a walk by myself, or getting lost in a good book for an hour. It can be a night out with friends, or a weekend away with my husband. And yes, sometimes it's just lounging by the pool with a cold drink in my hand.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The point is, it's important to take that time for yourself. It's not selfish, it's self-care. And when you come back, you'll be a better parent for it.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Still not convinced? Here are three reasons why it's okay - even necessary - to enjoy time away from your kids:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. It sets a good example. When your kids see you taking care of yourself, they learn that it's important to prioritize their own needs, too. You're showing them that self-care is a vital part of being a happy, healthy person.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. It strengthens your marriage. It's easy for couples to get lost in the chaos of parenting, and forget about their relationship with each other. Making time for date nights or weekend getaways can help keep that spark alive.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. It gives you perspective. When you're knee-deep in the day-to-day of parenting, it can be hard to see the forest for the trees. Taking a step back can help you gain some perspective, and remember why you're doing all this in the first place.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>So, go ahead and enjoy that time away from your kids guilt-free. You deserve it. And when you come back, you'll be refreshed, rejuvenated, and ready to take on the world - or at least the laundry.</p>
