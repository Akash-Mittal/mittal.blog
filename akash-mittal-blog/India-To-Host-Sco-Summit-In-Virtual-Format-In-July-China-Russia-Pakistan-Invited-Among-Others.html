  <p></p>
  <p>It was a gloomy day in New Delhi when the news arrived that India would host the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in July in a virtual format. Despite the pandemic, the summit would go ahead as planned, with the participation of leaders from China, Russia, Pakistan, and other member countries.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The SCO, with its six-member states, is one of the most influential regional organisations in the world. It has been instrumental in promoting regional stability, security, and economic cooperation in Central Asia and beyond. India's hosting of the SCO summit in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic is a clear indication of its commitment to multilateralism and regional cooperation.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable Examples</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The SCO countries have a combined population of 3.5 billion and a GDP of $17.3 trillion. The organisation covers three-fifths of Eurasia and controls over a quarter of the world's landmass. The SCO member countries account for nearly half of the world's population and over 23% of its GDP.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In recent years, the SCO has been instrumental in promoting regional economic integration and connectivity. It has established the SCO Development Bank and the SCO Interbank Consortium to promote trade and investment in the region. Additionally, the SCO has launched several joint economic projects, including the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and the North-South Transport Corridor (NSTC).</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>: "India sets stage for virtual SCO Summit during pandemic"</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion in 3 points</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. India's hosting of the SCO summit in a virtual format demonstrates its commitment to multilateralism and regional cooperation, despite the challenges posed by the pandemic.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. The SCO has been instrumental in promoting regional stability, security, and economic cooperation in Central Asia and beyond, and India's leadership in the organisation will further enhance its significance in the region.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. The virtual SCO summit provides an opportunity for India to deepen its engagement and cooperation with other member countries, particularly China and Russia, and to promote its interests and influence in the region.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p>I had the opportunity to visit Pakistan a few years ago and was struck by the potential for economic cooperation between India and Pakistan, particularly in the context of the SCO. Despite the unresolved issues between the two countries, there is huge potential for trade and investment in the region, which could benefit both countries.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, the virtual SCO summit is a significant event for India and the region, despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. India's leadership in the organisation will enhance its significance and influence in the region, and provide an opportunity for deeper engagement and cooperation with other member countries.</p>
