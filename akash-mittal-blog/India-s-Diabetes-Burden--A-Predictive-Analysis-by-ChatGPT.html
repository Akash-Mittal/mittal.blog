   <p>It is no secret that India is facing a growing epidemic of diabetes. In 2019, the International Diabetes Federation estimated that 77 million Indians were diagnosed with the disease, making India the world's diabetes capital.</p>
   <p>The prevalence of diabetes is projected to increase dramatically in India by 2050, as lifestyles become more sedentary and unhealthy. In fact, ChatGPT predicts that the total number of diabetic patients in India could surpass 130 million by mid-century.</p>
   <p>What does this mean for India and its citizens? Diabetes is a serious illness that can lead to numerous health complications, including cardiovascular disease, blindness, kidney failure, and amputations. The burden of diabetes on the Indian healthcare system and economy will only grow as the number of cases rises.</p>
   <p>However, there is hope. A growing number of companies in India are focusing on using technology to improve diabetes prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.</p><!-- Real Life Examples -->

   <p>One such company is Wellthy Therapeutics, a Mumbai-based startup that uses mobile apps and artificial intelligence to help individuals with diabetes manage their condition. Its app provides personalized coaching, nutritional guidance, and monitoring tools that track blood sugar levels, medication adherence, and exercise routines.</p>
   <p>Another company making strides in diabetes care is BeatO, based in New Delhi. Its flagship product is a smartphone-connected glucometer that allows diabetics to test their blood sugar levels and receive immediate medical advice from certified doctors. It also offers a range of diabetes-friendly foods and supplements for purchase on its website.</p>
   <p>Fortune India reports that the diabetic food and beverage market is set to grow exponentially in the coming years, with leading companies including Sugar Free, Dabur, and Britannia launching diabetic-friendly products. Even multinational corporations such as PepsiCo and Nestle are tapping into this lucrative market.</p><!-- Conclusion/Summary -->
