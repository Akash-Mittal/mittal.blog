    <p>Imagine waking up one morning, logging onto your computer to find that all of your critical data has been stolen. Your bank accounts are emptied, your credit is ruined, and your company's reputation is in shambles. This nightmare scenario is all too real for many companies, and it's only getting worse.</p>
    <p>As technology continues to advance, the threats against our businesses and personal lives become more sophisticated. Hackers and cybercriminals are constantly looking for new ways to find vulnerabilities and exploit them for their own personal gain. According to Forrester, one of the leading research companies in the world, the top cybersecurity threats of 2023 will be unlike anything we've seen before.</p>

   <section id="examples">
    
    <p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the top emerging cybersecurity threats that businesses need to be aware of. This technology uses AI to create fake images, videos, and audio that are incredibly realistic. With this technology, cybercriminals can create convincing phishing emails, social media posts, and other forms of cyber-attacks that are almost impossible to detect.</p>
    <p>Another cybersecurity threat that Forrester predicts will be an issue in 2023 is geopolitical tensions. With countries like China and Russia actively seeking to undermine Western nations, the risk for cyber-attacks from state-sponsored hackers is higher than ever. These attacks can be used to steal confidential information, disrupt critical infrastructure, and wreak havoc on the global economy.</p>
    <p>Quantum computing is another emerging technology that poses a significant threat to business cybersecurity. This technology uses quantum mechanics to process data in ways that are exponentially faster than traditional computing. This means that cybercriminals can use quantum computing to break encryption codes and steal confidential information.</p>
