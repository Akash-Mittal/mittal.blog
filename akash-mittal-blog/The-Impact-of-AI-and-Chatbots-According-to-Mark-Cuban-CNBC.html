    <p>Mark Cuban, the billionaire investor and entrepreneur, recently appeared on CNBC to discuss the impact of AI and chatbots in today's society. He shared his insights on how these technologies are transforming industries and changing the way we live and work.</p>
    <p>Cuban began by sharing a personal story about how he first encountered chatbots. He explained how he ordered a pair of shoes online and immediately received a notification from the retailer through Facebook Messenger. The message came from a chatbot, which asked him about his preferences and helped him find the perfect pair of shoes. Cuban was amazed at how the chatbot was able to understand his needs and assist him in his purchase without any human intervention.</p>
    <p>He went on to discuss the real-life examples of AI and chatbots in industries like healthcare, finance, and customer service. Cuban pointed out that chatbots are helping doctors to diagnose patients faster and accurately. They are also assisting banks in detecting fraud and improving customer engagement. In customer service, chatbots are automating routine inquiries, allowing human representatives to focus on more complex cases.</p>
    <p>Cuban also emphasized the potential benefits of AI and chatbots, such as increased productivity, cost savings, and improved decision-making. However, he acknowledged the potential drawbacks as well. The main concern is the displacement of human workers by automation. Cuban emphasized the need for companies to invest in retraining and reskilling their employees for the new economy.</p>
