   <p>Have you heard of ChatGPT? ChatGPT is an AI-based conversational agent that can be integrated into various websites or messaging platforms. However, recently, a group of cybersecurity experts have discovered that some hackers are using ChatGPT related software to conceal malware.</p>
   <p>One real-life example of this is the case of a multinational corporation that fell victim to a cyberattack. The company's security team discovered that the hackers had used ChatGPT related software to send messages to employees, pretending to be the CEO or other high-ranking personnel. These messages contained malware-laden links, which, when clicked, infected the employees' devices with malware.</p>
   <p>Another example is the attack on a major financial institution. The hackers used ChatGPT related software to send phishing messages to the institution's clients. These messages appeared to be legitimate and personalized, leading many clients to click on the links. Consequently, many clients unknowingly downloaded malware onto their devices.</p>
   <p>The main company involved in ChatGPT is OpenAI. They have acknowledged the problem and are taking measures to address it. They are working with cybersecurity firms to develop better security protocols for their software.</p>
   <p>Another company that is involved in this issue is Symantec. They offer cybersecurity solutions to protect businesses and individuals from cyber threats, including malware.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, the use of ChatGPT related software by hackers to disguise malware is a serious problem that needs to be addressed. Businesses and individuals need to be aware of this issue and take steps to protect themselves. Companies like OpenAI and Symantec are working to mitigate the risk, but ultimately, cybersecurity is everyone's responsibility.</p>
