  <p>Once upon a time, the stock market was a place where human traders would shout and wave their arms around to buy and sell stocks. But as technology has advanced, the majority of trading is now done by artificial intelligence systems. One such example is ChatGPT, an AI-powered chatbot that can predict market trends and make trades based on complex algorithms.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>On a fateful day in November 2021, the entire global stock market crashed as a result of a malfunction in ChatGPT. The bot, which was used by many of the world's largest financial institutions, started making massively incorrect predictions, causing panic among investors. Within hours, stock prices plummeted, wiping out trillions of dollars of wealth.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The incident highlighted the growing influence of AI on the financial world, and the potential risks of relying too heavily on these systems. Experts have called for greater regulation and oversight to prevent a similar catastrophe from happening again.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Real-life examples of AI causing market chaos abound. In 2010, the so-called "flash crash" saw the Dow Jones drop by nearly 1000 points in a matter of minutes, thanks to algorithmic trading systems gone rogue. And in 2019, a glitch in a popular trading app led to massive losses for its users.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The ChatGPT debacle was a wake-up call for the financial industry, and it has prompted major companies to rethink their reliance on AI. Some have called for "kill switches" to be built into these systems, allowing humans to override them in case of emergency. Others have argued that AI needs to be used more sparingly, with greater emphasis on human oversight and decision-making.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In any case, one thing is clear: the age of AI in finance has brought with it new and significant risks. As we continue to integrate these technologies into our lives and businesses, we must remain vigilant and cautious to ensure that they do not bring about unintended consequences.</p>
