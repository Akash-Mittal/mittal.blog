   <p>On a cloudy day in the small town of Hoopa, a young boy named Keawe eagerly waits for his schoolâs Zoom session to start. As a member of the Hoopa Valley Tribe, Keawe has always struggled with internet connectivity, which has hindered his education.</p>
   <p>But things are about to change for Keawe and thousands of other tribal members in the North Coast region of California. According to a recent Times-Standard report, three tribes have received federal funds to improve broadband access and infrastructure in their communities.</p>
   <h3>Concrete Examples of Progress</h3>
   <p>The Yurok Tribe, for instance, received $3.2 million in funding from the CARES Act to establish a wireless broadband network that connects seven communities along the Klamath River. The network will be powered by a solar energy system and will provide internet access to about 2,645 households.</p>
   <p>The Blue Lake Rancheria Tribe has also been awarded $26 million from the FCCâs Rural Digital Opportunity Fund to enhance broadband connectivity for people living on tribal lands in Humboldt County. This will include fiber optic infrastructure deployment and network upgrades.</p>
   <p>As for the Hoopa Valley Tribe, they have secured a $5.5 million grant from the California Public Utilities Commission to expand broadband access to 1,750 households and improve telehealth services.</p>
   <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
   <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the glaring digital divide that exists in America, especially in indigenous and rural communities. Without reliable internet access, people have struggled to work from home, attend online classes, receive medical care, and stay connected with loved ones.</p>
   <p>With these funding initiatives, tribal leaders and stakeholders are working to bridge this gap and ensure that everyone has access to essential services and opportunities.</p>
   <h3>In Conclusion</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>Three North Coast tribes have received millions of dollars in funding to improve broadband access and infrastructure in their communities.</li>
    <li>This will lead to concrete improvements such as wireless broadband networks, fiber optic infrastructure, and improved telehealth services.</li>
    <li>By connecting previously unconnected populations, these initiatives will help to reduce disparities and promote equity in the digital age.</li>
   </ol>
