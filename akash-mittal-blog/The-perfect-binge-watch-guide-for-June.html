  <p>As the scorching summer heat sets in, we all seem to love the idea of being stuck indoors with our favourite snacks and binge-worthy series. With so many upcoming web series in June, it's hard to know where to start, but we've got you covered.</p>
  <p>Let's start with the catchiest title, Asur 2. The first season of Asur was a massive hit among audiences last year and its second season is coming out on June 3rd on Voot Select. Asur is a crime thriller series that follows the story of a forensic expert and his team as they try to solve a series of murders that seem to be linked to ancient Indian mythology. With a talented cast including Arshad Warsi, Barun Sobti, and Anupriya Goenka, we can only expect an even more intriguing sequel.</p>
  <p>Next up is Never Have I Ever Season 4, which has built a massive fanbase since its debut in 2020. Created by the talented Mindy Kaling, the series follows the life of a high school girl trying to navigate through the ups and downs of being a teenager. Season 4 promises to be even more relatable and heart-warming than the previous ones. The series releases on Netflix on June 1st, so mark your calendars!</p>
  <p>Finally, coming up on June 10th is The Witcher Season 3, and we're more than excited to delve back into the enchanting world of Geralt of Rivia. Based on the novels by Andrzej Sapkowski, The Witcher is a fantasy series that revolves around a monster hunter and his destiny. With Henry Cavill's captivating portrayal of Geralt, we're expecting nothing less than exceptional performances from the cast.</p>

  </ul>
  <p>These numbers indicate that these series are not just popular but they also have been highly appreciated by viewers and critics alike. Not only that, but they also offer some great personal anecdotes and case studies that make them worth watching for anyone looking to learn a thing or two:</p>
