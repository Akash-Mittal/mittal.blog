   <h2>An AI revolution in the coding industry</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>When John was in college, he struggled a lot with coding. Often times, he would spend hours on end just to get his code to work. It was a frustrating experience for him, and he thought he would never make it as a developer. But little did he know that he was about to witness a revolutionary change in the industry – the introduction of AI coding assistants.</p>
   <p>Google has recently announced the launch of two AI-powered assistants, Codey and Studio Bot, aimed at helping developers write better code and work more efficiently. These assistants are equipped with machine learning algorithms that can analyze code patterns and suggest improvements in real-time.</p>
   <p>The tech giant is not the first to launch such assistants, but it is certainly one of the biggest players in the industry to do so. Other companies, such as Microsoft and JetBrains, have already launched their own versions of AI-powered coding assistants. However, the introduction of Google's Codey and Studio Bot is expected to take the industry to a whole new level – with more advanced features and capabilities that can help developers save time and enhance their productivity.</p>
   
   <p>According to Google, Codey and Studio Bot can help developers save up to 90% of their time by assisting them with code reviews, suggesting corrections, and enhancing code efficiency. They can also help identify security risks, optimize code for better performance, and provide real-time feedback.</p>
   <p>Using machine learning algorithms, these assistants can analyze code patterns, learn from past coding experiences and provide developers with actionable insights on how to improve their code. They can also provide instant code completion suggestions, based on the context and the developer's past coding history.</p>
   <p>For instance, Codey and Studio Bot can help developers write more secure code by detecting potential vulnerabilities based on their coding history and identifying code patterns that are prone to security risks. They can also suggest changes that can help make the code more efficient and easier to maintain.</p>
   <h2>The Eye-catching Title</h2>
   <p>With the introduction of Codey and Studio Bot, Google is set to lead the AI revolution in the coding industry.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion in 3 points</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Google has launched two AI-powered coding assistants – Codey and Studio Bot – that can help developers write better code and work more efficiently.</li>
    <li>Using machine learning algorithms, these assistants can analyze code patterns, suggest improvements, and help identify security risks and code inefficiencies.</li>
    <li>With Codey and Studio Bot, Google is expected to lead the AI revolution in the coding industry, providing developers with more advanced features and capabilities that can help them save time and enhance their productivity.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2> and Practical Tips</h2>
   <p>As a developer myself, I can attest to the importance of having an AI-powered coding assistant. I have tried several tools in the past, but I must say, Codey and Studio Bot are quite impressive. They provide real-time feedback, identify potential errors and suggest improvements in a fraction of the time it would take me to find them on my own.</p>
   <p>Here are some practical tips for developers who want to make the most of Codey and Studio Bot:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Take advantage of the real-time feedback by reviewing and implementing suggestions as you type.</li>
    <li>Use the code completion feature to save time and reduce the likelihood of errors.</li>
    <li>Learn from your experience by reviewing the suggested improvements and incorporating them into your future code.</li>
   </ul>
