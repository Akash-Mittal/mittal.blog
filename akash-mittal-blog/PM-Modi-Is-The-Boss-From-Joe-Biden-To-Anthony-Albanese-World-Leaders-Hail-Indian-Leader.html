   <p>Meanwhile, the head of the US, President Joe Biden, praised Modi for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic saying, "I want to thank you, Mr Prime Minister, for your continued leadership on the COVID-19 front." Biden added, "You have demonstrated that, despite an incredibly challenging year, India remains one of the most resilient nations in the world."</p>
   <p>In Australia, Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese praised Modi for his leadership and vision for the future. "India under your leadership is a thriving democracy, a critical player in the Indo-Pacific, and a global leader on climate action," he said.</p>
   <h2> Modi's Accomplishments</h2>

    <li>The Ayushman Bharat scheme, launched in 2018, aims to provide healthcare to over 100 million families in India, by offering them insurance coverage of up to INR 500,000 (approximately US$6,700) per year.</li>
    <li>India under Modi's leadership has become the world's third-largest manufacturer of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic, producing over 600,000 PPE kits daily.</li>
