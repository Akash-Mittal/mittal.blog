  <p> How To Pass Even If Your Professor Wants You To Fail: Practical Tips for Students</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>It was the most nerve-wracking exam of his life. James had studied very hard, staying up late almost every night to review and memorize the dense coursework and lecture notes. He had even practiced answering past exams and seeking advice from his classmates and professors. But when he received the results, he was stunned and disappointed. He failed. But why?</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>That was his question, and he was determined to know the answer. So, he talked to his regular classmate and found out that the method of teaching used by Professor Smith was only unique to him, and the exams were set up to look tougher than usual. Moreover, he discovered that there was a secret to passing the course which most students were unaware of, and it was passing his assignments. He had used this score as an avenue to influence the final result since it was the accumulation of scores that led up to success. From then on, James never failed that course again.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Professor Smith's attitude toward failing students is not unusual. But the truth remains that every student wants to succeed in their academics, and that should be the goal of every lecturer too. However, a student's success should not depend on the whims of any professor. No student deserves to fail, not because a lecturer feels like punishing them or because the coursework does not align with the student's interest. After all, the ultimate aim of education should be to enlighten, not pull down.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>So, if you find yourself in the same situation as James, do not fret. Here are some practical tips to help you pass even if your professor wants you to fail.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Create a Good Relationship with the Professor</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This might sound clich√©, but it is 100% true. Students who approach their professors to voice their concerns, ask questions, and ask for clarification tend to have better chances of passing than students who do not. Respectfully explain the difficulties you are experiencing, what you have done to prepare, and how you think you could improve. Ask to get the required support needed to excel. Faculty members will have time to help you, and you'd be surprised how forthright they will be when it comes to their expectations.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Make Use of Additional Resources</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Most faculties have additional resources available such as free tutoring, workshops, and academic advisors that can offer extra support for students who are struggling to keep up. You can also make use of the library and its resources as well. Maximizing these resources will go a long way in ensuring a successful outcome, particularly for the coursework and assignments.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Focus on the Assignment Activities</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Although exams are crucial, the assignments and coursework hold a significant percentage of the overall grade. Instructors often prepare assignments that sync with the course's expected knowledge and quality of writing. Therefore, students should meticulously follow the rubrics and instructions provided to present high-quality work. Doing so puts a flair on the grades, which leads to a better GPA result.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, students should not suffer from a lecturer's sadistic mentality. Instead, they should approach such educators with a humble attitude, seek additional support, and give their best performance, especially on the assignments. The tips provided above can make a considerable difference in your grades, even if your professor is seemingly hostile.</p>
