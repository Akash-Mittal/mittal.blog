He is currently the Prime Minister of India and a leader whose rise to power has been nothing short of meteoric. From being a humble tea seller to leading one of the world's largest democracies, Modi has come a long way.</p>
   <p>But, what makes him stand out is not just his personal story, but also his unwavering commitment to development and growth.

   <p>Modi's speech at G7 was not just a generic call to action, but a well-crafted plan that had some quantifiable examples to back it up.

This is no mean feat, considering that India's renewable energy capacity is currently at about 100 GW.</p>
   <p>He also spoke about India's commitment to vaccinating its entire adult population by December 2021, which he said would not only benefit India but also help other countries who are facing a shortage of vaccines.</p>

   <p>And, he didn't just stop at calling for action, but also provided practical tips on how to achieve it. For instance, he spoke about the need to tackle climate change by adopting a holistic approach that involves not just reducing emissions, but also increasing carbon sinks through sustainable forest management and promoting biodiversity.</p>
