  <h1>The Rise of Artificial Intelligence in Big Tech</h1> <img src="./images/The-Rise-of-Artificial-Intelligence-in-Big-Tech.jpeg" alt="+The Rise of Artificial Intelligence in Big Tech+">
  <p>Imagine you're driving home from work and the traffic is heavy. You just want to get home and relax but the traffic is taking forever. Suddenly, a notification pops up on your dashboard. Your navigation system is recommending a new route to avoid the traffic. You're surprised, wondering how the system knew that. Welcome to the world of Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p>
  <p>The use of AI has become increasingly popular in big tech companies such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook. AI has been used to enhance search algorithms, create chatbots, personalize online advertising, and so much more. With its ability to analyze vast amounts of data, AI has helped companies improve their products and services while also increasing their profits.</p>
  <h2>Real Life Examples</h2>
  <p>Google has been at the forefront of AI innovation, with their search algorithms getting smarter every day. Their machine learning technique, RankBrain, has been said to be the third most important factor in Google's search algorithm. It has revolutionized how Google understands search queries and provides better results for users.</p>
  <p>Amazon's chatbot, Alexa, has also become increasingly popular and has been integrated into many households. Alexa's ability to perform multiple tasks ranging from turning on lights to ordering pizza has made it a valuable addition to many homes.</p>
  <p>Facebook is using AI to provide personalized advertising based on user behavior. The platform uses machine learning techniques to analyze user data and provide advertisements that the user is likely to be interested in.</p>
  <h2>Critical Comments</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>While the use of AI has improved product and service offerings, there is a concern that AI may eventually replace human jobs.</li>
   <li>Another concern is the lack of transparency in how AI is being used. Many companies are not disclosing how they are using AI and this can lead to biases in decision making.</li>
   <li>There is also a fear that AI may be used for malicious purposes such as cyber attacks or deep fakes.</li>
  </ol>
