  <p>Meet Lan, a 28-year-old accountant living in Ho Chi Minh City. She works long hours and struggles to find a reliable mode of transportation to get home after dark. One night, she decides to download the ride-hailing app known as FastGo. This new entrant in the market promises better safety features and lower prices than its competitors. With nothing to lose, Lan decides to give it a try.</p>
  <p>FastGo is one of the latest players in Vietnam's ride-hailing scene, which has been dominated by Grab and Go-Jek for years. The arrival of FastGo in 2018 sparked a price war that led to discounted fares and increased competition for market share. Now, with the launch of its electric vehicle (EV) service, FastGo is hoping to shake things up once again.</p>
  <p>In addition to FastGo, several other ride-hailing services have taken notice of the EV trend in Vietnam. Grab has been testing a fleet of over 200 electric motorbikes and plans to expand its EV offerings. In May 2021, Go-Viet, a subsidiary of Go-Jek, launched its own EV service with 50 electric motorbikes in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.</p>
  <p>While the shift towards EVs is still in its early stages, Vietnam has become a key battleground for ride-hailing companies looking to gain an edge in the market. As the country's middle class continues to expand and demand for ride-hailing services grows, the potential rewards for emerging as the dominant player in the space are substantial.</p>
