   <p>Parenting can be a challenging and rewarding experience at the same time. As a parent, you want your kids to grow up to be successful, happy, and responsible adults. However, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to parenting. Each child is different, and what works for one may not work for another. That's why it's important to gather insights and ideas from different sources, including successful parents and experts.</p>
   <h2>Lessons from the Stars of Across the Spider-Verse</h2>
   <p>The upcoming movie "Across the Spider-Verse" features a star-studded cast, including Brian Tyree Henry, Luna Lauren Velez, and others. While they may be famous actors, they're also parents who face the same challenges as any other parent. In this article, we'll explore some of the lessons we can learn from them.</p>
   <h3>1. Be Present and Engaged</h3>
   <p>When you're a busy parent, it's easy to get caught up in your own world and forget about what's going on with your kids. However, being present and engaged is one of the most important things you can do as a parent. Brian Tyree Henry, who plays Jefferson Davis (also known as the superhero Prowler) in "Across the Spider-Verse," stresses the importance of spending quality time with your kids. "I try to be present and engage in activities with my son," he says. "We love to play video games and watch movies together. It's a great way to bond and create memories."</p>
   <p>This sentiment is echoed by Luna Lauren Velez, who plays Rio Morales (mother of the main character, Miles Morales). "The most important thing you can do as a parent is be present in your child's life," she says. "Listen to them, understand them, and support them. It's not always easy, but it's worth it."</p>
   <p>Being present and engaged doesn't mean you have to be with your kids 24/7. It means being intentional with your time and making an effort to create meaningful experiences with them.</p>
   <h3>2. Set Clear Boundaries</h3>
   <p>Setting boundaries is important for any relationship, including the one you have with your kids. Boundaries can help kids feel safe and secure, and they also teach them how to respect others. Lauren Velez stresses the importance of setting boundaries with your kids, especially when it comes to technology.</p>
   <blockquote>
    "It's important to monitor your kids' screen time and make sure they're not spending too much time on their devices," she says. "Set clear rules and boundaries, and stick to them. It's not always easy, but it's important for their health and wellbeing."
   </blockquote>
   <p>Brian Tyree Henry agrees. "Setting boundaries is important because it teaches your kids how to respect themselves and others," he says. "It's a way to show them that you care about their safety and wellbeing."</p>
   <p>When setting boundaries, it's important to be clear and consistent. Make sure your kids understand the rules and consequences, and be prepared to enforce them when necessary.</p>
   <h3>3. Encourage Creativity and Individuality</h3>
   <p>As a parent, it's natural to want your kids to succeed and fit in with their peers. However, it's also important to encourage their creativity and individuality. Brian Tyree Henry, who is also a musician, believes that encouraging creativity is essential for kids.</p>
   <blockquote>
    "I think it's important to expose your kids to different forms of art and creativity," he says. "Whether it's music, painting, or writing, it's a way for them to express themselves and discover their passions."
   </blockquote>
   <p>Luna Lauren Velez agrees. "Kids are unique, and it's important to encourage their individuality," she says. "Support their interests and give them the freedom to explore who they are."</p>
   <p>Encouraging creativity and individuality can help your kids develop confidence and a sense of self. It can also help them find their passion and purpose in life.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>Parenting is a journey, and every parent faces their own unique set of challenges. However, learning from successful parents and experts can help you become a better parent. As we've seen from the stars of "Across the Spider-Verse," being present and engaged, setting clear boundaries, and encouraging creativity and individuality are essential for raising happy, healthy, and successful kids.</p>
