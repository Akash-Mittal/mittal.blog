    <p>Being a parent is one of the most challenging and rewarding journeys in life. This is true even for famous celebrity parents like Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcone. They both have opened up about the ups and downs of parenting in a number of interviews over the years.</p>
    
    <p>For example, in an interview with People, Melissa McCarthy shared her experience with potty training her daughter Vivian. She said, "It was not my finest hour. It involved bribery. It involved begging. It involved crying on my part and hers." This shows that even celebrities struggle with the age-old challenge of potty training.</p>
    <p>Ben Falcone also shared a humorous yet relatable story in an interview with Today. He discussed how he accidentally gave his daughter a permanent marker, and she drew all over her face and body. He said, "It takes years off your life," referring to the stress of trying to clean off the marker without causing harm to his daughter.</p>

    <p>Another point that McCarthy has made in interviews is that she tries to set an example for her daughters by being strong and confident. She said in an interview with NPR, "I don't want my girls to look at me and think, 'Oh, she's worried about the size of her thighs, so I should too.' I'm trying to teach them to have a really strong sense of their own self-worth."</p>
