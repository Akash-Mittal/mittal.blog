    <p>Mia had always been a career-driven woman. She had a successful job, a great husband, and an exciting social life. But when she got pregnant, she felt a mixture of excitement and fear.

    <p>After giving birth to her son, Mia found herself struggling with an identity crisis. She no longer knew who she was, or what her purpose in life was. She felt like she had lost her sense of self, and that motherhood had taken over everything else.</p>
