   <p>Alchemy, a blockchain infrastructure provider, is making big moves to support the growing Web3 ecosystem. Recently, their venture arm, Alchemy Ventures, announced that they are looking to invest in startups that are aligned with their mission and values.</p>
   <p>But what sets apart 'Web3 missionaries' from 'Web3 mercenaries'? According to Nikil Viswanathan, the CEO of Alchemy, it's all about the approach.</p>
   <section>
    <h2>A Story of Two Startups</h2>
    <p>To understand the difference, let's consider the story of two hypothetical startups - A and B. Both the startups are working in the blockchain space and have raised seed funding from various investors. However, they have different motivations and goals.</p>
    <p>Startup A is solely focused on making quick profits and uses unethical tactics to gain an edge over its competitors. They cut corners, ignore regulatory compliance, and manipulate the market to gain temporary success.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, Startup B is driven by a vision to create a better world through blockchain. Their goal is to leverage the power of decentralized technology to solve real-world problems and create a more equitable society.</p>
    <p>Which startup would you choose to invest in? The answer is obvious - Startup B. They are the 'Web3 missionaries' who are driven by a higher purpose, rather than just making money.</p>

    <h2>Concrete Examples of 'Web3 Missionaries'</h2>
    <p>So, who are these 'Web3 missionaries' that Alchemy Ventures is looking to invest in? Here are some examples:</p>
    <ul>
     <li><strong>Unstoppable Domains:</strong> They are building a decentralized domain name system (DNS) that is censorship-resistant and gives users full control over their online identities.</li>
     <li><strong>Aave:</strong> Aave is a decentralized lending platform that enables users to borrow and lend assets without intermediaries.</li>
     <li><strong>Gnosis:</strong> Gnosis is building a decentralized prediction market platform that allows users to speculate on future events and information.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These startups are not only building innovative products, but they are also aligned with the ethos of blockchain - decentralization, transparency, and empowerment.</p>
