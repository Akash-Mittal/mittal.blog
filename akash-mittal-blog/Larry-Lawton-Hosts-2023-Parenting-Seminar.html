  <h1>Larry Lawton Hosts 2023 Parenting Seminar</h1> <img src="images/Larry-Lawton-Hosts-2023-Parenting-Seminar.jpeg" alt="+Larry-Lawton-Hosts-2023-Parenting-Seminar+">
  <p>In 1986, Larry Lawton was sentenced to 12 years in prison for a series of armed robberies. During his time behind bars, Lawton made the decision to turn his life around and become a better person. Today, he's a reformed criminal who has dedicated his life to helping others make better choices.</p>
  <p>In 2023, Lawton will be hosting a parenting seminar to teach parents how to raise their children to become responsible, successful adults. The seminar will focus on practical strategies that parents can use to help their children avoid the mistakes that Lawton made in his own life.</p>
  
  <p>The seminar will feature a number of quantifiable examples to help parents understand the impact that their parenting choices can have on their children's future. For example:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Studies show that children who have parents who are involved in their lives are more likely to succeed in school.</li>
   <li>According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, children who have strong relationships with their parents are less likely to experiment with drugs and alcohol.</li>
   <li>A survey conducted by the Pew Research Center found that 71% of Americans believe that parents today are not doing enough to teach their children about responsibility.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2></h2>
  <p>The title of the parenting seminar is "Raising Responsible Kids in an Irresponsible World". The title is eye-catching because it highlights a common problem that many parents face: how to teach their children to be responsible in a world that often seems to reward irresponsibility.</p>
  <h2></h2>
  <ol>
   <li>Parenting is one of the most important jobs that anyone can have. The choices that parents make can have a profound impact on their children's future.</li>

   <li>The seminar will be a valuable resource for any parents who are looking for guidance on how to raise their children in today's world.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Lawton will be sharing his personal story during the seminar to illustrate the importance of making the right choices in life.
