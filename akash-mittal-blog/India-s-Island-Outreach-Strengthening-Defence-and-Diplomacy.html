   <h2>Story of India's Island Outreach</h2>
   <p>The story of India's Island Outreach dates back to 2014, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi outlined a bold new vision for India's foreign policy in his keynote address at the Indian Council of World Affairs. In his speech, Modi outlined the concept of 'SAGAR' (Security and Growth for All in the Region) and emphasised the importance of India's maritime neighbourhood to the country's security and prosperity.</p>
   <p>Following this speech, India began to build a comprehensive strategy of engagement with its island neighbours. The aim was to promote greater maritime security, economic development, and cultural ties across the region. This led to the formation of the 'Neighbourhood First' policy, which seeks to strengthen India's relations with neighbouring countries through enhanced connectivity, economic cooperation and cultural exchanges.</p>
