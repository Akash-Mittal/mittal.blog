   <p>Every day, we witness new technological breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) that seem almost surreal. We can instruct Alexa to play our favorite music; our smartphones suggest the fastest route to work; smart homes adjust lighting and temperature based on our habits. But, do we ever wonder how AI is changing the game for businesses around the world? Here are some real-life examples of companies using AI and how it is transforming their business.</p>
   <h2>1. Amazon - Personalized Recommendations</h2>
   <p>Amazon has become the most prominent example of AI-incorporated technology. The company's success is largely attributed to the personalized recommendations algorithm, which utilizes machine learning and predictive analytics. Customers receive targeted product recommendations based on their purchase history and search queries. This approach has revolutionized the online retail industry by providing customers with a more personalized experience.</p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>
   <h2>2. IBM - Watson Analytics</h2>
   <p>IBM's Watson Analytics is a brilliant example of how AI is transforming the world of data analysis. Watson Analytics assists businesses in managing and analyzing data by providing them with insights they wouldn't arrive at in the traditional way. With Watson Analytics, businesses can work with data sets more significant than they could handle before, enabling them to make data-driven decisions. This approach not only helps businesses to analyze data faster and more accurately, but it also saves time and minimizes human biases.</p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson-analytics">IBM</a>

As a result, Netflix can create content that has the highest potential for success, ensuring its continued popularity.</p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a>
