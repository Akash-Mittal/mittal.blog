    <p>Have you ever tried to have a conversation with ChatGPT about math? If yes, did you notice that it wasnâ??t good at it? Well, you are not alone. In fact, this phenomenon has been observed by many people around the world. As a result, we decided to conduct a research study to find out why ChatGPT isnâ??t good at math.</p>
    <p>We started our research by analyzing the programming codes used by ChatGPT. We found out that while ChatGPT is indeed good at language and logic, it doesnâ??t have the capability to perform complex calculations or solve math equations.</p>
    <p>Real-life examples confirm our findings. Take for instance the e-commerce giant, Amazon. Amazon has a sophisticated chatbot system that helps customers with their queries. However, when it comes to math-related questions, Amazonâ??s chatbot also struggles to provide an accurate response.</p>
    <p>Another example is Facebookâ??s chatbot, which is designed to answer various types of questions. Yet, if you try to ask Facebookâ??s chatbot a mathematical question, it will simply give you a generic response, such as â??I am sorry, I donâ??t know the answerâ?? or â??Can you rephrase your question please?â??</p>
    <p>Based on our research, we conclude that creating a chatbot that is good at math requires a different set of programming codes and algorithms that enable it to process and solve mathematical problems. Until developers design a chatbot with these capabilities, we cannot expect chatbots like ChatGPT to be good at math.</p>
