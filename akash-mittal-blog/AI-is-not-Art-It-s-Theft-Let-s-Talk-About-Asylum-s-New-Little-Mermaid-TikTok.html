    <h3>The Little Mermaid TikTok That Started It All</h3>
    <p>Asylum, an AI art platform, recently released a TikTok showcasing their latest creation: an AI-generated version of The Little Mermaid. The video went viral, amassing over a million views within its first 24 hours. While many were impressed with the lifelike quality of the animation, others were left skeptical. Is AI-generated art really art, or is it just theft?</p>

    <h3> AI-Generated Art</h3>
    <ul>
     <li>Portrait of Edmond de Belamy - an AI-generated portrait that sold for $432,500 at Christie's</li>
     <li>AI Art at the Barbican - an exhibit featuring works created by AI systems</li>
     <li>GAN-generated Art - an example of AI-generated art using Generative Adversarial Networks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These examples demonstrate that AI-generated art is not only possible, but also profitable. However, the question remains of whether or not it can be considered true art.</p>

    <h3>The Ethics of AI-Generated Art</h3>
    <p>One argument against AI-generated art is that it is essentially theft. The AI system is fed images and then spits out a "new" creation based on that data. But is that really creating something new? Or is it simply regurgitating what it has been taught? On the other hand, proponents of AI-generated art argue that art has always been able to evolve with new technologies, and AI is simply the next step in that evolution.</p>

    <h3>Personal Anecdote</h3>
    <p>As an artist myself, I have mixed feelings about AI-generated art. On one hand, I appreciate the potential for new forms of creative expression. On the other hand, I worry that it will take away jobs from human artists and devalue the true craftsmanship and skill that goes into creating art by hand.</p>
