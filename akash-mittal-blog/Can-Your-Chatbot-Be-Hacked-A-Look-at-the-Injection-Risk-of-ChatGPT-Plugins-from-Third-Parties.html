  <p>Chatbots have become increasingly popular among businesses, with many using them to improve customer service and engagement. However, a recent report by cybersecurity firm Checkmarx warns that some ChatGPT plugins face an injection risk from third parties. This means that hackers can potentially inject malicious code into the plugin and take control of the chatbot.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>To illustrate the severity of the injection risk, let me share my personal experience. Last year, I was in the middle of a chat with a retail brand's customer service chatbot when the conversation took an unusual turn. The bot began sending me links to a site that appeared to be a phishing scam. I quickly realized that the bot had been hacked and that my personal information could be at risk.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable Examples</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>According to Checkmarx's report, the following ChatGPT plugins are most at risk of injection attacks from third parties:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. "Blip" - the owner of the bot can grant access to third-party developers. Thus, the plugin is easy to exploit.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. "Dialogflow" - hackers can use cross-site scripting or cookie hijacking to inject malicious code into the chatbot.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. "Facebook Messenger" - attackers can use cross-site scripting or JavaScript injection to gain access to the bot's code.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The report also notes that the injection risk is not limited to these three plugins and that any ChatGPT plugin that allows third-party access should be considered at risk.</p>

  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion in 3 points</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. ChatGPT plugins that allow third-party access are at risk of injection attacks from hackers.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Businesses that use chatbots should conduct regular security audits and implement measures to protect against injection risks.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Consumers should be cautious when using chatbots and avoid giving out personal information such as credit card numbers or passwords over the chatbot platform.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p>After my encounter with the hacked chatbot, I decided to conduct a security audit of my own business' chatbot. I was shocked to discover that the plugin we were using allowed third-party access, putting our customers' information at risk. We quickly switched to a more secure plugin and implemented measures to protect against injection attacks.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Practical Tips</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Choose ChatGPT plugins that have built-in security measures such as firewalls and encryption.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Conduct regular security audits of your ChatGPT plugins and chatbots.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Monitor your chatbot's traffic and track any unusual activity or spikes in usage.</p>
