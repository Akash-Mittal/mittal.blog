    <h2>A frustrating customer support experience</h2>
    <p>As an online shopper, Jane was excited to receive her order from XYZ, a major e-commerce company, until she realized that the wrong items had been shipped. She tried calling the company's customer service numbers but after waiting on hold for 30 minutes, she decided to try the ChatGPT option available on the website.</p>
    <p>However, her excitement soon turned into frustration as she realized that ChatGPT, the chatbot employed by the company for customer support, was unable to comprehend her problem or provide a satisfactory solution. After several attempts and responses that were completely off-topic, Jane finally gave up and decided to return the items in person.</p>

    <h2>Real-life examples of ChatGPT limitations</h2>
    <p>Unfortunately, Jane's experience with ChatGPT is not unique. Many companies have implemented chatbots for customer support, and while they may seem like an efficient and cost-effective option, they often fall short of providing a satisfactory customer experience.</p>
    <p>For instance, Amazon's chatbot was unable to help a customer who had received a damaged product and kept asking irrelevant questions. Similarly, Bank of America's chatbot was unable to process a customer's request for a new debit card and suggested calling instead.</p>
    <p>Another major problem with chatbots is their inability to manage complex situations or understand nuances in customer queries. For instance, H&amp;M's chatbot was unable to identify the right size for a customer's order or provide information about in-store availability.</p>

     <li>Chatbots are unable to manage complex situations, understand nuances in customer queries, and provide personalized solutions.</li>
     <li>To ensure a positive customer experience, companies must strike a balance between human support and automation, and implement technology that enhance but not replace human interactions.</li>
