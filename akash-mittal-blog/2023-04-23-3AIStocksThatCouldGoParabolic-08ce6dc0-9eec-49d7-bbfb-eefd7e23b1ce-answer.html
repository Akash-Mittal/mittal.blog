  <p>AI is a rapidly growing and evolving industry, with new technologies and applications being developed every day. Investing in AI stocks can be extremely profitable, especially considering the potential for long-term growth. Here's a story that illustrates the importance of investing in AI:</p>
  <p>Meet Alex. She's a tech enthusiast and an avid investor. She recently invested $1,000 in an AI stock, hoping to cash in on the emerging technology. Six months later, she checked her portfolio to find that her investment had grown to $1,900. Excited about the success of her investment, Alex realized the potential of the AI industry and decided to invest even more.</p>
  <p>Investing in AI stocks can be a smart and profitable choice, especially if done right. Here are three AI stocks that could go parabolic:</p>
  <ol>
