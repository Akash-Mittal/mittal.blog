  <p>Imagine waking up to the sound of birds chirping and stepping out onto your balcony to see the lush greenery of a golf course stretching out before you. This is the reality for residents of the new luxury apartments at Cecil Golf Course in Pittsburgh.</p>
  
  <p>Living on the greens not only provides stunning views, but also has tangible benefits. According to a study by the National Association of Home Builders, homes on or near golf courses have a higher resale value than those that are not. In fact, they found that homes on golf courses typically sell for 8-12% more than their counterparts.</p>
  <p>Additionally, living on a golf course often comes with amenities such as access to a clubhouse, pool, and fitness center. All of these amenities can lead to a healthier and more social lifestyle, which can improve overall well-being.</p>
