    <h2>About Self Represented Litigants</h2>
    <p>Self Represented Litigants, or SRLs, are individuals who choose to represent themselves in court hearings rather than hire a lawyer. This trend has been growing in recent years, as people are becoming more comfortable with the idea of representing themselves in court. It is also seen as a way to save money, as lawyers can be prohibitively expensive.</p>
    <p>However, representing oneself in court is not without its challenges. Legal proceedings can be complicated, and a lack of experience and training can put SRLs at a disadvantage. There is also the issue of bias - judges and other legal professionals may be more sympathetic to those with representation.</p>

    <h2>Examples of Self Represented Litigants</h2>
    <p>There are many examples of SRLs, both in criminal and civil cases. Here are a few:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>An individual representing themselves in a divorce case</li>
     <li>A small business owner who is suing a former employee</li>
     <li>Someone contesting a traffic ticket in court</li>
    </ul>
    <p>According to a report from the National Self-Represented Litigants Project, as many as 60% of people involved in family law cases represent themselves in court. Civil cases also have a high rate of SRLs - up to 75% in some areas, according to the same report.</p>
