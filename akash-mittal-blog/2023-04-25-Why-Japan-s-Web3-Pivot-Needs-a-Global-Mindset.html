  <p>Japan's Web3 pivot is an exciting development that offers numerous opportunities for growth and innovation. However, to truly succeed in this area, a global mindset and flexibility are essential. Let's explore why.</p>
  <h2>The Story of a Japanese Incubator Founder</h2>
  <p>As an incubator founder in Japan, I have had the opportunity to work with numerous startups in the Web3 space. One thing that has become abundantly clear is that a narrow focus on Japan alone simply won't cut it. To be successful in this arena, it's important to have a global mindset and the flexibility to adapt to rapidly changing circumstances.</p>
  <h2>Concrete Examples</h2>
  <p>Consider the success of companies like Ethereum and Binance. These companies have taken a global approach to Web3, recognizing the importance of engaging with communities and stakeholders around the world. By doing so, they have been able to build robust, decentralized ecosystems that are truly innovative.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, companies that have remained focused exclusively on Japan have struggled to gain traction. They may have innovative ideas, but without a global approach, they simply can't compete.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion: The Three Keys</h2>
  <ol>
   <li><strong>A Global Mindset:</strong> Companies must be willing to engage with stakeholders and communities around the world in order to build innovative, decentralized ecosystems. This requires a willingness to learn from others, to listen to feedback, and to be flexible in adapting to different cultural and regulatory environments.</li>
   <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Web3 is a rapidly evolving field, and companies that are inflexible risk being left behind. Successful companies in this area will need to be agile, able to pivot quickly as circumstances change, and willing to experiment and take risks.</li>
   <li><strong>Focus on Innovation:</strong> At the end of the day, it will be the companies that are truly innovative that will succeed in the Web3 space. This requires a relentless focus on building new and better technologies, processes, and services, and a willingness to challenge traditional models and ways of thinking.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>By embracing these three keys—global mindset, flexibility, and a focus on innovation—companies in Japan's Web3 ecosystem can position themselves for success in an increasingly competitive and dynamic field.</p>
