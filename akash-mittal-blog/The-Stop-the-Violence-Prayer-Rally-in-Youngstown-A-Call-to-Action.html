  <p>Youngstown, Ohio has experienced a surge in violent crimes in recent months, leaving many residents feeling scared and helpless. But on Saturday, August 14th, the community came together for a Stop the Violence Prayer Rally at St. Edward Church to show their intention to take action and bring peace to their streets.</p>
  <p>The event was organized by a coalition of local churches, non-profits, and community leaders who believe that prayer alone is not enough to combat the violence plaguing their neighborhoods. They planned a powerful program that included speeches, musical performances, and most importantly, a call to action.</p>
  <h2>Quantifying the Issue</h2>
  <p>The need for the Stop the Violence Prayer Rally is clear when you look at the numbers. According to data from the Youngstown Police Department, there were 46 homicides in the city from January 1st, 2021 to August 10th, 2021. This is a 48% increase from the same time period in 2020, and a 91% increase from 2019.</p>
  <p>But it's not just homicides that are on the rise. The Youngstown Police Department also reported a 25% increase in shots fired calls, a 77% increase in robberies, and a 37% increase in aggravated assaults from January 1st, 2021 to August 10th, 2021 compared to the same time period in 2020.</p>
  <h2>A Call to Action</h2>
  <p>The Stop the Violence Prayer Rally was not just about acknowledging the problem, but also about empowering the community to take action. The speakers and performers reminded attendees that they have the power to make a change, and that change begins with each individual.</p>
  <p>Rev. Jerry Ellington, one of the organizers of the event, gave an impassioned speech about the need for unity and action. "We can't just sit back and pray for the violence to stop," he said. "We have to be the ones to make it stop. We have to be willing to step up and say 'enough is enough'."</p>
  <p>Other speakers shared personal stories of how violence has impacted their lives and their communities, emphasizing the need for everyone to come together and work towards a common goal of peace and safety.</p>
  <h2>The Importance of Community Involvement</h2>
  <p>One of the key themes of the Stop the Violence Prayer Rally was the importance of community involvement in ending the cycle of violence. Many speakers emphasized that it's not just about relying on law enforcement to solve the problem, but also about everyone doing their part to create a safer community.</p>
  <p>Pastor Michael Harrison, another organizer of the event, spoke about the need for everyone to be "upstanders" rather than bystanders. "We can't just stand by and watch as violence tears our community apart," he said. "We have to be upstanders, speaking out against violence and working together to make our streets safe."</p>
  <p>Several community non-profits were also represented at the event, including the Mahoning Valley Sojourn to the Past, which works to teach local students about nonviolent social change. Representatives from the group spoke about their efforts to empower young people to become agents of change in their communities.</p>
