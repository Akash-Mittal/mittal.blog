  <h1>Pakistan's Protest on G20 Meeting Hosted in India</h1> <img src="images/Pakistan-lodges-protest-with-countries-that-attended-G20-meeting-In-India.jpeg" alt="+Pakistan-lodges-protest-with-countries-that-attended-G20-meeting-In-India+">
  <p>On September 15, 2021, Pakistan lodged a protest with countries that attended the G20 meeting in India, expressing their concern over the recent developments in Jammu and Kashmir. The G20 summit is an international forum of the world's largest economies, including Pakistan and India, focusing on economic cooperation and policy coordination.</p>
  <p>The Pakistani government expressed their disappointment with India hosting the meeting, citing the country's widespread human rights abuses in Kashmir and the ongoing conflict between the two countries. Pakistan stressed the importance of addressing the Kashmir dispute, which has been ongoing since the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947.</p>
  <p>The Indian government has denied any wrongdoing in the Kashmir region and has repeatedly asserted that the Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of the country.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Pakistan's Discontent</h2>
  <p>Since India revoked the constitutional autonomy of the region in August 2019, and implemented a communication blackout and a major security crackdown in the area, Pakistan has regularly raised the issue in international forums and called out India for human rights abuses in the region. The Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan played a leading role in highlighting the plight of Kashmiris through his speeches in the United Nations General Assembly, and other international forums.</p>
  <p>The country has also suspended trade and transport links with India since 2019, and has been unwilling to resume talks and resume diplomatic relations until India changes its policies towards Kashmir.</p>
  <h3>Pakistan's Demonstration at G20 Meeting</h3>
  <p>Pakistan also held demonstrations outside Indian and Pakistani embassies in different countries, demanding that India stop human rights violations and unilateral decisions in Kashmir. The protesters called on the G20 member countries to put pressure on India to resolve the Kashmir issue and stop the human rights abuses in the region.</p>
  <p>Despite Pakistan's protests, India has managed to host the G20 summit successfully and used the platform to engage with world leaders and discuss various economic issues.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, Pakistan's protest against the G20 meeting held in India marks another chapter in the ongoing dispute between the two countries over Kashmir. The conflict has lasted for over 70 years and has resulted in several wars and skirmishes along the Kashmiri border. Despite the growing unrest and tensions between India and Pakistan, it is essential that both nations sit down and negotiate a peaceful solution to the longstanding dispute. The international community has an important role to play in encouraging dialogue between the two countries and supporting a peaceful resolution to the conflict.</p>
