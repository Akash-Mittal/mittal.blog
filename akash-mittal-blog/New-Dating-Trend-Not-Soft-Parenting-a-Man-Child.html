   <p>Have you ever dated someone who expected you to take care of them like a parent? Maybe they always asked you to cook for them, clean up after them, or pay their bills. Or perhaps they were emotionally needy, relying on you to constantly reassure them, fix their problems, and listen to their complaints.</p>
   <p>That's what happened to my friend Sara. She met a guy named Matt who seemed charming and fun at first. But after a few weeks of dating, she realized that he was a man child. He couldn't take care of himself, let alone contribute to a healthy relationship. She ended up feeling drained, frustrated, and resentful.</p>
   <p>But instead of giving up on dating altogether, Sara decided to embrace a new trend that's gaining popularity among women who are tired of coddling grown men. It's called Not Soft Parenting a Man Child, and it's all about setting boundaries, holding men accountable, and prioritizing your own needs.</p>
   
   <p>To understand this trend better, let's look at some quantifiable examples:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>According to a survey by the dating app Hinge, 63% of women said they would not date someone who lives with their parents.</li>
    <li>A study by the dating site Zoosk found that 78% of women prefer men who are financially stable and responsible.</li>
    <li>The popular Instagram account @thefemininefeminist has over 370k followers who share their experiences of dealing with man children and the strategies they use to avoid them.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>An </h2>
   <p>The title of this trend is key to catching people's attention and conveying its message. Not Soft Parenting a Man Child is a playful twist on the idea of tough love and discipline without being harsh or cruel. It suggests that women can still be caring and nurturing without sacrificing their own autonomy and respect.</p>
   <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
   <p>One woman named Lauren shared her story on @thefemininefeminist about how she used to date a man child who would constantly ask her to do his laundry, cook his meals, and pick up after him. She said, "I realized that I was enabling his immaturity and not respecting myself enough to demand better treatment." So she broke up with him and started dating a man who was self-sufficient and respectful.</p>
   <p>Another woman named Maria said that she used to feel guilty for saying no to her boyfriend's demands, but now she knows that she has the right to prioritize her own needs and feelings. She said, "I'm not his mother, and I'm not his servant. I'm his equal partner, and I deserve to be treated as such."</p>
