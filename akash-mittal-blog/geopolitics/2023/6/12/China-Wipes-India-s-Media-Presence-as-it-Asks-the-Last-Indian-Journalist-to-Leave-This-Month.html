  <p>Amidst the ongoing tension between China and India, the former has asked the last Indian journalist to leave the country. Beijing and New Delhi have been ejecting each other's reporters in a tit-for-tat row, deepening the rift between the Asian economic powerhouses. The move to eliminate India's media presents in China reflects the tightening control on free speech and the press in the country.</p>
  <h2>A Case Study: Journalists Facing Difficulties in China</h2>
  <p>The expulsion of Indian journalists is not an uncommon event in China. For years, the government has been restricting journalists from carrying out their work by pulling visas, blocking access to certain sensitive areas, and monitoring communication. In 2008, Beijing resorted to high-level harassment and persecution of foreign journalists covering the Olympic torch relay. The Chinese authorities went to the extent of physically obstructing reporters, confiscating footage, and detaining journalists.</p>
  <p>The Chinese Foreign Correspondents' Club (FCCC) in Beijing, a group representing hundreds of foreign journalists in China, released an annual report stating that last year was the worst on record for press freedom since 2013. The FCCC revealed that journalists in China were exposed to violence, censorship, and intimidation, which contradicted the Chinese government's commitment to its citizens' freedom of speech.</p>
  <h2>The Implications of China's Move to Expel Indian Journalists</h2>
  <p>China's decision to eradicate Indian journalists from the country implies several consequences that affect the media, China-India relations, and global affairs:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>Increasing censorship:</strong> China's move to eject Indian journalists seek to curtail news that may displease the government and obstruct the exchange of information, which implies increasing censorship within the country.</li>
   <li><strong>Strained bilateral relations:</strong> The tit-for-tat move further exacerbates the strained relations caused by border clashes in 2020, leading to a decline in India-China relations.</li>
   <li><strong>Regional and global implications:</strong> The expulsion of Indian journalists from China is not an isolated event; the increasing trend of media repression threatens to generate massive global implications, primarily in countries where democratic norms, freedom of the press, and free speech fundamentals are under threat.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>China's move to eradicate Indian journalists from the country is a significant step in media suppression. The increased censorship within China has heightened the need for independent and transparent reporting. Journalists must be allowed to carry on with their duties without fear of persecution or losing access to sensitive areas. The global community must also rise and defend media rights and press freedom, considering the wider implications of these events.</p>
