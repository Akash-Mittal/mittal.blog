  <p>It was in 2014 when a humble tea seller from Gujarat, Narendra Modi, took the oath as the Prime Minister of India. A man with a vision and a purpose, he had pledged to bring about a transformation in the country and make it a better place for all Indians. It has been almost a decade since he took over the reins of the country, and today, India is a different country, a country that is transforming, evolving, and growing with each passing day.</p>
  <h2>How Modi Has Transformed India?</h2>
  <p>From reviving the manufacturing sector to improving agricultural productivity, from boosting foreign relations to launching ambitious schemes like the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the Jan Dhan Yojana, and the Ayushman Bharat, PM Modi has ushered in a new era of development and progress in India. Let's take a look at some of the success stories and case studies that showcase his vision and leadership.</p>
  <h3>Success Story 1: Jan Dhan Yojana</h3>
  <p>The Jan Dhan Yojana, launched in 2014, is one of the most ambitious schemes launched by PM Modi. The scheme aimed to provide every Indian household with a bank account and a debit card by August 2015. Within a year of its launch, the scheme achieved its target, with more than 19 crore bank accounts opened and more than 17 crore debit cards issued. The scheme has helped bring financial inclusion to millions of Indians, especially those living in rural areas and has brought a significant change in their lives.</p>
  <h3>Success Story 2: Swachh Bharat Abhiyan</h3>
  <p>The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, launched in 2014, aimed to make India clean and free from open defecation. Since its launch, the campaign has achieved remarkable success, with more than 10 crore toilets built across the country and over 5 lakh villages and several towns and cities declared open defecation-free. The campaign has not only brought about a significant improvement in the sanitation and hygiene of the country but also helped in bringing behavioral change among people.</p>
  <h3>Success Story 3: Ayushman Bharat</h3>
  <p>The Ayushman Bharat scheme, launched in 2018, aims to provide universal healthcare coverage to more than 10 crore families across India. The scheme provides health insurance coverage of up to Rs 5 lakh per family and covers hospitalization expenses, including pre-existing conditions. Since its launch, the scheme has provided more than 1.5 crore treatments, and more than 25,000 hospitals have been empanelled under the scheme. The scheme has helped provide affordable and quality healthcare to millions of Indians.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The transformation of India under PM Modi is not just limited to these success stories and case studies. His leadership has helped the country in several other areas, including socio-economic development, infrastructure growth, foreign relations, and more. Today, India is a country that is moving forward, a country that is transforming, and a country that is poised to become a global superpower. Modi hai to mumkin hai is not just a chant but a reality that we all are witnessing.</p>
