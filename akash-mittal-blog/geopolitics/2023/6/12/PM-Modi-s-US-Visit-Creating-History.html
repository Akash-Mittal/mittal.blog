  <p>It's not every day that an Indian Prime Minister addresses the US Congress twice. But that's exactly what happened when PM Modi visited the United States in 2021. He became the first Indian Prime Minister to do so, making history in the process. But this visit was about more than just speeches. It was also about regional security and collaboration on Indo-Pacific matters. Let's take a closer look at what went down.</p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1631648343145-e7f54b0f6d0f?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwcm9maWxlLWxpa2VkfDZ8ZG9JQXBFNzhxWVx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=800&amp;q=60" alt="PM Modi US Visit">
  <h2>Regional Security</h2>
  <p>When PM Modi met with Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh during his visit to the US, they discussed a range of regional security issues. These included the ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan, Myanmar, and Syria. The two leaders also discussed the threat of terrorism and the need for closer cooperation between India and the US to combat it.</p>
  <p>Case Study: In 2019, India conducted airstrikes in Pakistan following a terrorist attack in Kashmir that killed over 40 Indian soldiers. The response was seen as a message to Pakistan that India would not allow terrorist attacks to go unpunished. The US supported India's right to defend itself against terrorist threats.</p>
  <h2>Collaboration on Indo-Pacific Matters</h2>
  <p>The US reiterated its commitment to collaborating closely with India on issues pertaining to the Indo-Pacific. This is a region that has become increasingly important in recent years due to its economic, political, and strategic significance. Both India and the US view the region as key to their respective geopolitical interests and have been working to enhance their cooperation in this area.</p>
  <p>Case Study: In 2020, India signed a military logistics agreement with the US that allows both countries to use each other's military facilities for refueling and repairs. This agreement is seen as a significant step towards greater military cooperation between India and the US in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>PM Modi's US visit was historic in many ways. He became the first Indian Prime Minister to address the US Congress twice, and discussions focused on important regional security issues and collaboration on Indo-Pacific matters. As the world becomes increasingly connected, it's important for nations to work together to address common challenges and opportunities. India and the US are taking steps towards this goal, and their cooperation will be key to a more prosperous and secure future.</p>
