   <p>As the world is still grappling with COVID-19, a new challenge awaits India and Pakistan as Cyclone Biparjoy approaches their coasts.</p>
   <p>But why is it such a big deal?</p>
   <p>Cyclones are not new to these countries, but their impact has been increasing in recent years due to climate change, rapid urbanisation, and poor management of natural resources.</p>
   <p>For instance, in 2019, Cyclone Fani hit the Indian states of Odisha and West Bengal, causing widespread destruction and displacement of over 1.5 million people. The estimated economic loss was pegged at $8.1 billion. In the same year, Pakistan was hit by two cyclones, Vayu and Kyarr, which caused heavy rains, flooding, and loss of life and property.</p>
   <p>These incidents highlight the need for better disaster preparedness, risk reduction and management strategies, and community engagement in disaster risk reduction (DRR) activities.</p>
   <h2>DRR and Cyclone Management</h2>
   <p>DRR encompasses a range of activities that help reduce the risk and impact of natural hazards. This includes early warning systems, evacuation plans, preparedness drills, risk assessments, and infrastructure improvements.</p>
   <p>One of the main challenges in DRR in India and Pakistan is the lack of coordination and collaboration across different sectors and levels of governance. Often, different agencies work in silos, leading to duplication, information gaps, and inadequate resource allocation.</p>
   <p>For example, during Cyclone Fani, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) provided timely and accurate forecasts, but the local authorities were not adequately prepared to handle the situation. Similarly, during the 2010 floods in Pakistan, the response was delayed due to the absence of a centralized command and control system and lack of coordination among the relief agencies.</p>
   <h2>Community Engagement in DRR</h2>
   <p>Another critical aspect of DRR is community engagement. This includes involving local communities in risk assessments, disaster planning, and capacity building activities.</p>
   <p>This is especially crucial in countries like India and Pakistan, where over half of the population lives in rural areas and is highly vulnerable to natural hazards. Community-based approaches can help build resilience to disasters and empower people to take ownership of their safety and well-being.</p>
   <p>For example, in Odisha, a state that is prone to cyclones and floods, the Community Managed Disaster Risk Reduction (CMDRR) programme has been successful in involving local communities in DRR activities. Under this programme, local communities are trained in search and rescue, first aid, and early warning systems, and provided with basic equipment such as life jackets and torches. The programme has significantly reduced the loss of life and property during disasters.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>Cyclone Biparjoy is a reminder of the urgent need to invest in DRR and climate resilience in India and Pakistan. While technical solutions such as early warning systems and infrastructure improvements are essential, they need to be complemented by community engagement and cross-sectoral coordination.</p>
   <p>DRR is not just a matter of saving lives and property. It is also a means of building stronger communities, promoting sustainable development, and mitigating the adverse impacts of climate change.</p>
