   <p>In a recent incident, an IndiGo Airlines flight from Amritsar to Ahmedabad was briefly diverted to Pakistan airspace near Lahore due to bad weather. Although the aircraft was not allowed to land in Pakistan, it did enter its airspace for a short duration before heading back to India.</p>
   <h2>Impact of Bad Weather on Aviation</h2>
   <p>Bad weather can cause a lot of problems for the aviation industry, including flight delays, diversions, and cancellations. It can also lead to difficult and dangerous flying conditions, which can put passengers and crew at risk. Moreover, it can have economic repercussions, affecting airlines' revenue and profitability.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <h3>Case Study 1: Hurricane Harvey</h3>
   <p>When Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas in 2017, it caused widespread damage and flooding, including to the airports in the affected areas. Many flights were cancelled or delayed, and some were diverted to other airports. Southwest Airlines alone cancelled over 5,000 flights during the storm, which cost the company an estimated $100 million in revenue.</p>
   <h3>Case Study 2: Icelandic Volcano Eruption</h3>
   <p>In 2010, the eruption of the Eyjafjallaj√∂kull volcano in Iceland led to the closure of airspace over much of Europe for several days. This resulted in widespread flight cancellations and diversions, affecting millions of passengers. The Icelandic eruption caused an estimated $1.7 billion in lost revenue for the aviation industry.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>Bad weather is a major challenge for the aviation industry, but it is also a reminder of the importance of safety and preparedness. Airlines and airports must have robust contingency plans in place to deal with extreme weather conditions, and they must communicate effectively with their passengers to minimize disruptions and inconvenience. By doing so, they can ensure that their operations remain safe, efficient, and profitable.</p>
