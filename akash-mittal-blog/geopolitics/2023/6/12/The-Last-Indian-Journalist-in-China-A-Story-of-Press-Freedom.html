  <p>It was a sunny day in Beijing when I first met Raju, the last Indian journalist in China. He was sitting in a caf√©, sipping his coffee and reading through his notes. As I introduced myself, Raju looked up and smiled.</p>
  <p>"I know who you are," he said. "You're one of those people who want to know what's really going on in China."</p>
  <p>He was right. I was curious about China, its politics, its people, its culture. And as a journalist, I knew that Raju was the perfect person to talk to. He had been working in China for over a decade, reporting on everything from human rights abuses to economic development.</p>
  <h2>The Last Indian Journalist</h2>
  <p>But as we talked, I began to realize that Raju's time in China was coming to an end. He had just received a notice from the Chinese government, asking him to leave the country within the month. Raju was shocked, but not surprised. He knew that press freedom in China was limited, and that foreign journalists were often targeted for their reporting.</p>
  <p>"It's getting harder and harder to do our jobs here," he said. "Every year, there are more restrictions, more censorship, more surveillance."</p>
  <p>Raju's situation is not unique. In 2020, the Chinese government expelled more than a dozen foreign journalists, including reporters from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post. These journalists were targeted for their reporting on sensitive topics, such as the coronavirus pandemic and the Hong Kong protests.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>But it's not just foreign journalists who are facing harassment in China. Chinese journalists who report on sensitive topics are also at risk. In 2015, journalist Gao Yu was sentenced to seven years in prison for leaking a Communist Party document to a foreign news outlet. In 2018, journalist Huang Qi was sentenced to 12 years in prison for reporting on sensitive topics such as human rights abuses.</p>
  <p>For Chinese journalists, the risks are even greater. They face arrest, imprisonment, and torture for writing about sensitive topics such as corruption, human rights abuses, and government censorship. In recent years, many journalists have been forced to flee the country, leaving behind their families and their careers.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The situation for journalists in China is dire. Press freedom is limited, censorship is widespread, and journalists are regularly targeted for their reporting. Foreign journalists are increasingly being expelled from the country, and Chinese journalists face even greater risks. The international community must continue to speak out against these abuses and demand that the Chinese government respect freedom of the press.</p>
