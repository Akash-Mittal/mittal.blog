  <p>Recently, China has asked the last remaining Indian reporter to leave the country by the end of August. This move comes amidst the ongoing tension between India and China. This action by China has sparked a debate on Press Freedom and the restrictions imposed on it. This incident is not an isolated one. Many countries have faced similar issues.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <h3>Turkey:</h3>
  <p>In 2017, Turkey arrested a German journalist, Deniz Yucel, for political reasons. He was accused of spreading terrorist propaganda and was imprisoned for a year without any trial. This sparked an international outcry, with many countries condemning Turkey's actions. After a year of detention, Yucel was finally released but many other journalists in Turkey still face similar issues.</p>
  <h3>Egypt:</h3>
  <p>In Egypt, many journalists were arrested and detained for reporting on anti-government activities. Mohammad Morsi, the former President of Egypt, was ousted in a coup and many journalists were imprisoned for reporting on it. One such journalist was Mahmoud Abou Zeid, who was detained for 5 years without any trial. He was finally released in 2019, but many other journalists still face similar threats in Egypt.</p>
  <h3>China:</h3>
  <p>China has always been under the scanner for its treatment of journalists. Many foreign journalists have faced restrictions and have been expelled from the country. In 2020, China expelled several journalists from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post. This was done in retaliation for the restrictions imposed by the US government on Chinese journalists. The restrictions imposed by China on foreign journalists are only increasing.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The press plays a crucial role in any democracy. It is the watchdog that keeps a check on the government and reports any wrongdoings. However, in many countries, the press is facing restrictions and is not allowed to function freely. The case studies mentioned above show that this is not just a problem in one country, but a global issue. It is important for governments to ensure that the press is allowed to function freely and report without any fear of retribution.</p>
