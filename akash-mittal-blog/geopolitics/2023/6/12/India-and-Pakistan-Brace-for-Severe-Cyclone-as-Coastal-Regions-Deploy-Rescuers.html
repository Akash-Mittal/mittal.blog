  <p>As the world is already grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, it seems as if nature is also adding its fair share of disaster and destruction. India and Pakistan are preparing for the first severe cyclone of the year that is expected to hit their coastal regions later this week. While both countries have been working tirelessly to avert the cyclone impact, the natural disaster's intensity remains unpredictable, leaving the citizens on precarious grounds.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>According to early predictions by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), the storm developing over the Arabian Sea, Cyclone Tauktae, may rise to the level of the 1998 Gujarat cyclone, causing catastrophic destruction. The IMD has issued an orange "be prepared" alert for the coastal districts of Kerala, Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra and Gujarat to brace for heavy rains, powerful winds and a potential sea surge.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The Indian government has already evacuated around 12,000 people from low-lying areas, with rescue teams deployed to conduct search-and-rescue operations, should the worst occur. The Indian Navy, Indian Airforce, and the National Disaster Response Force are all mobilizing their resources to prepare for the impending disaster. Similarly, in Pakistan, Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral M. Amjad Khan Niazi, has instructed the Pakistan Navy to stay alert to help overcome any emergencies caused by the cyclone.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>While disasters like cyclones are a regular occurrence in coastal areas of India and Pakistan, living with them is fraught with challenges for the citizens and authorities. In recent times, Cyclone Amphan, which hit India's eastern coast last year, had killed at least 85 people, while Cyclone Fani in 2019 killed at least 64. Similarly, in Pakistan, Cyclone Kyarr hit the country's coast in 2019, causing severe damage to properties and the local fishing industry.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In the face of such devastation, it is clear that there is an urgent need for a comprehensive approach to disaster management in coastal areas. This approach must include preparations for the immediate evacuation of people, stockpiling of essential supplies, and the deployment of adequately trained first responders.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Moreover, there must be a bigger emphasis on preemptive measures that can mitigate the impact of these disasters. The Indian government launched the National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project (NCRMP) in 2016, which sought to enhance the ability of coastal communities to mitigate the impact of cyclones. This project includes building strong local-level governance structures, early warning systems, and improving infrastructure, among other measures. While such measures are necessary, the pace of implementation needs to be accelerated to meet the ever-increasing threat posed by climate change.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, natural disasters like cyclones remind us of our vulnerability in the face of nature's fury. While the Indian and Pakistani governments are doing their best to prepare for Cyclone Tauktae, we need to be reminded of the urgent need to adopt measures that mitigate the impact of such disasters in the future. These measures should include adopting a comprehensive approach to disaster management, focusing on preemptive measures, and accelerating the pace of project implementation.</p>
