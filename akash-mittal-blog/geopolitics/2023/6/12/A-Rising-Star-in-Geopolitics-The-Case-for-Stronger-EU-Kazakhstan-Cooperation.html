  <p>It was a sunny afternoon in Almaty, the largest city of Kazakhstan, when a group of European diplomats were welcomed by their Kazakh counterparts for a roundtable discussion on bilateral relations. As the conversation progressed, it became clear that the two sides shared a growing interest in further deepening their ties, not only in trade and investment but also in political and security cooperation.</p>
  <p>For the past few years, Kazakhstan has been quietly emerging as a rising star in geopolitics, thanks to its strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, its vast natural resources, and its steady economic growth. With a population of over 18 million and a territory larger than Western Europe, Kazakhstan has the potential to become a key player in global affairs, especially in the fields of energy, transport, and security.</p>
  <h2>The Case for Stronger EU-Kazakhstan Cooperation</h2>
  <p>According to former diplomats who have closely followed Kazakhstan's foreign policy, there are several reasons why the EU should pay more attention to this Central Asian nation:</p>
  <h3>1. Bridging Europe and Asia</h3>
  <p>With the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) by China, there is a growing sense of urgency among European countries to find ways to counterbalance Beijing's expanding influence in Eurasia. Kazakhstan, as a landlocked country that shares borders with both China and Russia, offers a unique opportunity for the EU to deepen its engagement in the region and promote its own connectivity projects. For instance, the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route (TITR), a multimodal corridor that links the Caspian Sea with Europe via Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, could be a game-changer for trade and investment between the EU and Central Asia, if supported by the necessary infrastructure and regulatory frameworks.</p>
  <h3>2. Diversifying Energy Supplies</h3>
  <p>Kazakhstan is a major oil and gas producer, ranking among the top 15 countries in the world in terms of proved reserves. As Europe seeks to reduce its dependence on Russian energy imports and shift towards cleaner sources of energy, Kazakhstan could become an attractive alternative supplier. The recent completion of the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), which connects Azerbaijan's Shah Deniz II gas field with Italy via Greece and Albania, is a step in this direction, but more needs to be done to ensure the security and sustainability of energy supplies in the region.</p>
  <h3>3. Advancing Regional Security</h3>
  <p>Kazakhstan has been a key player in promoting peace and stability in Central Asia, notably through its active participation in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a regional security forum that also includes China, Russia, and several other countries. As the SCO continues to expand its scope and influence, the EU could benefit from engaging with Kazakhstan on common security challenges, such as terrorism, organized crime, and cyber threats. Moreover, Kazakhstan's decision to renounce its nuclear arsenal in 1991 and ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) in 2008 is a testament to its commitment to disarmament and non-proliferation, which could serve as a model for other countries in the region and beyond.</p>
  <h2>The Risks of Being Overtaken by China</h2>
  <p>While Kazakhstan's potential for closer cooperation with the EU is evident, there are also significant risks if the EU fails to act in a timely and decisive manner. The most obvious risk is that China, with its deep pockets and ambitious projects, could outcompete the EU in gaining access and influence in Kazakhstan and the wider region. This is already happening in some sectors, such as energy, infrastructure, and technology, where Chinese companies have secured major contracts and investments. If the EU does not offer a viable alternative to China's BRI, it risks being marginalized and losing its strategic foothold in Central Asia.</p>
  <p>The second risk is that Russia, Kazakhstan's traditional ally and neighbor, could view the EU's closer engagement as a hostile move and try to disrupt or undermine it. Moscow has already demonstrated its willingness to use economic and political pressure to prevent other countries from cozying up to the West, as seen in the cases of Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova. If the EU fails to reassure Russia that its cooperation with Kazakhstan is not aimed at encircling or isolating Russia, it risks triggering a new round of tensions and conflicts in the region.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>There is now a growing consensus among experts and policymakers that the EU needs to step up its game in Central Asia and engage more proactively with countries like Kazakhstan. This requires a long-term and strategic vision, as well as concrete actions and investments, that take into account the interests and concerns of all stakeholders. The EU-Kazakhstan Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (EPCA), signed in 2015, provides a solid framework for such cooperation, but more needs to be done to implement and expand it.</p>
  <p>If the EU wants to keep its status as a global player and advance its own strategic interests, it cannot afford to ignore the rising star of Kazakhstan.</p>
