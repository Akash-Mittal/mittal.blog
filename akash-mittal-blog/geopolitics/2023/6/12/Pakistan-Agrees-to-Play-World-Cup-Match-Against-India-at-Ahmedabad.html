   <p>In the world of cricket, few matches are as highly anticipated as the one between India and Pakistan. The historic rivalry between the two nations can be traced back to their first encounter on the cricket field in 1952. Since then, these matches have become much more than just a game of cricket, with emotions running high and national pride at stake.</p>
   <p>However, in recent years, due to political tensions between the two nations, these matches have become few and far in between. The last time these two teams met in a bilateral series was in 2012-2013. Since then, they have only faced each other in multi-team events such as the World Cup and the Asia Cup.</p>
   <p>For the upcoming ICC World Cup in 2023, the BCCI and PCB have finally agreed on the venue of their highly-anticipated match â€“ Ahmedabad. This decision comes as a relief to cricket fans worldwide who were eagerly waiting for this announcement.</p>
