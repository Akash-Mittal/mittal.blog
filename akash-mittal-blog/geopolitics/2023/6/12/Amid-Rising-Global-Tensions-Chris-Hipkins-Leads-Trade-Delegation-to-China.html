  <p>As global superpowers compete for influence all over the world, New Zealand's Prime Minister Chris Hipkins is heading to China this month to lead a trade delegation. This visit bears witness to a deepening relationship between the two countries, both facing rising global tensions, with China vying for dominance against the United States.</p>
  
  <p>New Zealand has always held a unique place in the world when it comes to diplomacy. It has maintained a "lean diplomacy" approach where it conducts trade with other countries without taking sides in the global power struggle. However, recent developments have forced New Zealand to rethink its foreign policies, especially when it comes to balancing the engagement between the US and China. For instance, New Zealand has drawn some criticisms from its allies, especially the US and Australia, for not reacting more strongly against China's actions in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.</p>
  <p>At the same time, New Zealand's relationship with China has been growing stronger. In 2020 alone, New Zealand's trade with China was worth NZ$32 billion, accounting for around 28% of the country's total trade. China is the largest market for New Zealand's dairy, meat, and wool products and also a significant source of tourists.</p>
  <p>The upcoming delegation to China, led by Chris Hipkins, is further testimony to the importance of the relationship between the two countries. The main objective of this visit is to enhance trade ties between the two nations, which could benefit both parties immensely.</p>
  <h2>Examples with Case Studies</h2>
  <p>New Zealand's relationship with China has not always been smooth, and several incidents have strained the ties between the two nations in recent years. For instance, in 2018, New Zealand was the first nation to openly criticize China's actions in the South China Sea. While this outraged China, New Zealand maintained its position by stating that it would continue to make decisions based on principle irrespective of whether they were pleasing or displeasing to China.</p>
  <p>Another incident was the Huawei controversy, where New Zealand did not follow the US's lead in banning the Chinese tech company from bidding for 5G contracts. Instead, New Zealand conducted its own security assessment of Huawei's technology and allowed the company to bid for 5G contracts with a few restrictions in place. This decision did not go down well with the US, and it even issued a warning to New Zealand that there could be "intelligence-sharing repercussions".</p>
  <p>However, New Zealand's handling of the pandemic has earned it some praise from China, and this has helped strengthen the relationship between the two nations. New Zealand's response to COVID-19 has been lauded globally, and China considers New Zealand as one of the few countries that have managed to control the pandemic effectively.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion: Top Three Points</h2>
  <p>As New Zealand's Prime Minister Chris Hipkins embarks on his visit to China, it remains to be seen whether he can maintain the country's unique diplomatic position in the world. Here are the top three points to consider:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>China is a significant trading partner for New Zealand, and it is essential for the country's economic growth that it maintains a healthy relationship with China.</li>
   <li>New Zealand has come under increasing pressure from its allies to take a more critical stance against China, which puts the country in a delicate position of aligning itself with its values while maintaining its economic ties.</li>
   <li>While Chris Hipkins' visit is focused on trade, it may also have implications for security and intelligence sharing between New Zealand and China, especially given the recent diplomatic tensions among the world's global superpowers.</li>
  </ol>
