  <p>China has asked the last Indian journalist to leave the country. This move comes amid deteriorating bilateral relations between the two countries after border clashes. The expulsion of journalists is a tit-for-tat move, as India had earlier expelled six Chinese journalists in June.</p>
  <h2>Interesting Story</h2>
  <p>Journalism is meant to be the conscience of a society, bringing to light issues that need attention and holding those in power accountable. But in recent times, the press freedom index has been showing a downward trend globally.</p>
  <p>The two Asian giants, China and India, have been in the news recently after they expelled journalists from each other's countries. While China has been known for its strict censorship policies, India's recent move has come as a surprise.</p>
  <p>With this recent development in mind, it's crucial to understand the implications of such actions, not just for the press, but for the society as a whole.</p>
  <h2>Examples with Case Studies</h2>
  <h3>China's Crackdown on Press Freedom</h3>
  <p>China has long been known for its strict censorship policies and tight control over the media. The government controls what information is broadcasted to the public through the state-run media outlets.</p>
  <p>Recently, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, China has been cracking down on press freedom even more. Journalists who report on the pandemic have been targeted by the government with arrests, harassment, and intimidation.</p>
  <p>The repercussions of such actions have been felt globally, with several countries condemning China's actions and calling for press freedom.</p>
  <h3>India's Surprising Move</h3>
  <p>India has long been known for its free press, with several reports pointing out that the country has a relatively high degree of press freedom when compared to other countries in the region.</p>
  <p>However, in a surprising move earlier this year, India expelled six Chinese journalists, citing "activities outside their journalistic capacity". This kickstarted a chain of events, ultimately leading to the recent expulsion of the last Indian journalist in China.</p>
  <p>The move has been criticized by several media rights organizations, with some calling it a violation of press freedom.</p>
  <h3>The Implications of Press Freedom Violations</h3>
  <p>Press freedom is crucial for a healthy democracy. It enables journalists to report on issues that need attention and hold those in power accountable.</p>
  <p>Journalists who are not free to do their job, or those who report without the necessary protection, risk becoming victims of censorship, harassment, or worse, losing their lives.</p>
  <p>The violation of press freedom can also lead to a society where misinformation and false narratives are prevalent. Without a free press, citizens may not have access to critical information, which is integral to making informed decisions and participating in governance.</p>
