  <p>Cricket has always been a sport that unites people regardless of their gender, nationality, age or religion. However, there is one match that always stands out as the biggest rivalry in the world of cricket: India versus Pakistan. They have been playing against each other since 1952 and ever since, the matches between these two teams have been nothing short of a war. The intensity and passion that runs in the blood of both sets of fans make every match between India and Pakistan a spectacle to watch.</p>
  <h2>The History</h2>
  <p>The India-Pakistan rivalry is rooted in the political and cultural divide between the two countries that began during the partition of India in 1947. The two countries have gone to war four times over Kashmir, a disputed region that both countries claim as their own. This political tension has often spilled over onto the cricketing field, where both teams fight tooth and nail to prove their supremacy on the pitch.</p>
  <p>India and Pakistan first played each other in a Test match in Delhi in 1952. Since then, both teams have played against each other in 59 Test matches, with India winning 9 and Pakistan winning 12. In One Day Internationals, both teams have played 131 matches against each other, with Pakistan winning 73 and India winning 54.</p>
  <h2>The Match</h2>

The players are not just representing their countries, but also their people and their culture. The match is watched by millions around the world and the pressure on the players is immense.</p>
  <p>One such match that will forever be etched in the memories of cricket lovers around the world is the 2007 ICC T20 World Cup final. The match was played in Johannesburg, South Africa, and India were the underdogs going into the final. Pakistan batted first and put up a respectable total of 152/6 in their 20 overs. India had a shaky start to their innings but were kept in the game by a brilliant innings from Gautam Gambhir. The match went down to the wire, with India needing 13 runs to win off the last over. The last over was bowled by Pakistan's star fast bowler, Mohammad Asif. With just one run needed off the last ball, Misbah-ul-Haq, Pakistan's last hope, went for a scoop shot that ended up being caught on the boundary. India won the match by just 5 runs and lifted the T20 World Cup trophy for the first time.</p>
