   <p>Another example of the intense rivalry between India and Pakistan is the 2011 World Cup semi-final. India won the match by 29 runs and went on to win the tournament, but the victory was bittersweet. The match was played in Mohali, India, and tensions were high in the lead-up to the game. The Indian government had even increased security measures, as there were concerns about possible attacks from militants.</p>
