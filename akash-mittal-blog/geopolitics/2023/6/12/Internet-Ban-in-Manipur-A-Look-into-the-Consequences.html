   <p>In December 2021, the government of Manipur, India decided to impose a ban on mobile Internet services and SMS in the state. The ban was initially for 48 hours, but it has been extended for 5 more days citing security concerns. This article aims to discuss the impact of the Internet ban in Manipur.</p>
   <h2>Impact on Education</h2>
   <p>The Internet ban in Manipur has severely impacted the education of students in the state. With online classes becoming the norm due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ban has left students with no way to attend online classes or access educational resources. Students who were preparing for competitive exams such as JEE and NEET have been particularly affected, as they depend heavily on online resources to prepare for the exams.</p>
   <p>The following case study highlights the challenges faced by students in Manipur due to the Internet ban:</p>
   <table>
    <thead>
     <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Age</th>
      <th>Class</th>
      <th>Challenges Faced</th>
     </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
     <tr>
      <td>Ahmed</td>
      <td>17</td>
      <td>12</td>
      <td>Unable to attend online classes; No access to study material</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>Kalyani</td>
      <td>20</td>
      <td>Graduate</td>
      <td>Unable to apply for higher education courses online</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>Ravi</td>
      <td>18</td>
      <td>12</td>
      <td>Unable to prepare for competitive exams due to lack of online resources</td>
     </tr>
    </tbody>
   </table>
   <h2>Impact on Economy</h2>
   <p>The Internet ban in Manipur has also had serious repercussions on the state's economy. With businesses unable to access online payment platforms or communicate with their customers online, the ban has severely affected their operations. Online marketplaces such as Amazon and Flipkart have also been unavailable, leading to a decline in online shopping activities. The tourism industry in Manipur has also been impacted, as tourists are unable to access online travel services or information.</p>
   <p>The following case study highlights the economic impact of the Internet ban in Manipur:</p>
   <table>
    <thead>
     <tr>
      <th>Industry</th>
      <th>Impact</th>
     </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
     <tr>
      <td>E-commerce</td>
      <td>Orders and sales declined by 90%</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>Tourism</td>
      <td>Loss of revenue due to inability to attract tourists</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>Retail</td>
      <td>Unable to accept online payments; Decline in sales</td>
     </tr>
    </tbody>
   </table>
   <h2>Impact on Freedom of Expression</h2>
   <p>The Internet ban in Manipur has also raised concerns about the impact on freedom of expression and access to information. The ban has effectively silenced the voices of citizens who use the Internet to express their opinions or share information. Social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have been inaccessible, limiting the ability of citizens to engage in meaningful discourse. Additionally, journalists and media outlets are unable to access online news sources, impeding their ability to report on events accurately.</p>
   <p>The following case study highlights the impact on freedom of expression and access to information in Manipur:</p>
   <table>
    <thead>
     <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Profession</th>
      <th>Impact</th>
     </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
     <tr>
      <td>Rajesh</td>
      <td>Journalist</td>
      <td>Unable to access news sources online; Unable to report on events accurately</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>Maria</td>
      <td>Social Activist</td>
      <td>Unable to use social media to connect with like-minded individuals; Unable to express opinions</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>Karthik</td>
      <td>Student</td>
      <td>Unable to access study material or participate in online discussions</td>
     </tr>
    </tbody>
   </table>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The Internet ban in Manipur has had far-reaching consequences on the education, economy, and freedom of expression in the state. Students have been unable to attend online classes or access educational resources, leading to a decline in their academic performance. Businesses have suffered due to the inability to access online payment platforms or communicate with their customers online, leading to a decline in sales. Citizens have had their voices silenced due to the inability to use social media to express their opinions or connect with like-minded individuals. It is essential for governments to balance the need for security with the right of citizens to access information and express themselves freely.</p>
