    <h2>The Interesting Story</h2>
    <p>The Asia Cup is a biennial competition featuring cricket teams from South Asia and other countries. However, the last edition of the tournament in 2018 was marred by the political tension between India and Pakistan. The Indian team had refused to travel to Pakistan due to security concerns, resulting in the tournament being held in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) instead. The tensions between the two nations have continued since then, which has led to uncertainty over the venue of the next edition of the tournament in 2020.</p>
    <p>Reports have emerged that Sri Lanka is the front-runner to host the tournament. The Asian Cricket Council (ACC) is expected to make a formal announcement on the matter very soon. Sri Lanka has hosted the Asia Cup four times already and has the required infrastructure and experience to host a major international tournament.</p>

    <h2>Examples with Case Studies</h2>
    <p>The choice of Sri Lanka as the potential venue for the Asia Cup after the India-Pakistan row is a logical one. Firstly, Sri Lanka has been a regular host of international cricket matches and tournaments for decades. The infrastructure in the country is world-class, with several international stadiums boasting excellent facilities. The Pallekele International Cricket Stadium and the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo are both capable of hosting major tournaments and have been praised by players and officials alike.</p>
    <p>Secondly, Sri Lanka has experience in hosting the Asia Cup itself. The country has hosted the tournament on four previous occasions â€“ in 1986, 1997, 2004, and 2010. The successful hosting of these editions is a testament to Sri Lanka's ability to organize and manage major international cricket tournaments.</p>
    <p>Finally, Sri Lanka has a good relationship with all the Asian cricket-playing nations, including India and Pakistan. In fact, Sri Lanka has played a key role in promoting cricket in the region, having co-founded the ACC alongside India and Pakistan in 1983. The country has also been a neutral venue for several Indo-Pak matches in the past. Thus, hosting the Asia Cup in Sri Lanka would likely be seen as a safe and politically-neutral option.</p>
