  <h1>The Era of Slimming Nuclear Stockpiles Ends: A Report on China's Expansion of Arsenals</h1></br> <img src="images/The-Era-of-Slimming-Nuclear-Stockpiles-Ends-A-Report-on-China-s-Expansion-of-Arsenals.jpeg" alt="+The-Era-of-Slimming-Nuclear-Stockpiles-Ends-A-Report-on-China-s-Expansion-of-Arsenals+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/china-leading-way-as-nuclear-powers-expand-arsenals-report-warns/" target="_blank" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/china-leading-way-as-nuclear-powers-expand-arsenals-report-warns/" rel="noopener">https://www.timesofisrael.com/china-leading-way-as-nuclear-powers-expand-arsenals-report-warns/</a></span></h5>
  <p><strong>Once upon a time, there was a global push towards reducing nuclear stockpiles and achieving a nuclear-free world.</strong> In 1986, the U.S. and the Soviet Union signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which eliminated their entire class of nuclear missiles and launchers. In the 1990s, the U.S. and Russia further reduced their strategic nuclear weapons and signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). In 2010, President Obama and President Medvedev signed the New START, which further lowered the number of deployed strategic nuclear weapons. The reduction of nuclear stockpiles was seen as a crucial step towards global security and peace.</p>
  <p>However, according to a new report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the era of slimming nuclear stockpiles is ending. In fact, the world's nine nuclear-armed states—the US, Russia, China, France, the UK, India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea—are all either modernizing their arsenals or deploying new nuclear weapons.</p>
  <h2>China Leading the Way as Nuclear Powers Expand Arsenals</h2>
  <p><strong>According to the report, China is the front-runner in expanding its nuclear arsenal.</strong> China's nuclear arsenal, which is estimated to be around 320 warheads, is relatively small compared to that of the US and Russia, which have around 5,800 and 6,375 nuclear warheads, respectively. However, China is rapidly modernizing and expanding its arsenal, with the goal of reaching 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030.</p>
  <p><strong>China's nuclear expansion poses a serious challenge to the strategic balance of power in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.</strong> China's military strategy emphasizes the role of nuclear weapons in deterring the US and its allies from intervening in any potential conflict over Taiwan, the South China Sea, or other areas of regional dispute. China's nuclear buildup also signals its growing ambition to become a superpower and project power beyond its borders.</p>
  <p><strong>China's nuclear expansion also risks triggering a nuclear arms race in the region and beyond.</strong> India and Pakistan, for example, are following China's lead and expanding their own nuclear arsenals. India, which has a no-first-use policy, is investing in a new class of nuclear-powered submarines and is believed to be developing thermonuclear weapons that can boost the yield of its nuclear warheads. Pakistan, which sees its nuclear weapons as a way to counter India's conventional superiority, is developing low-yield and tactical nuclear weapons that can be used in a battlefield scenario.</p>
  <h2>Israel's Nuclear Arsenal Unchanged</h2>
  <p><strong>One outlier in the report is Israel, which is said to keep its nuclear inventory unchanged.</strong> Israel, widely believed to possess nuclear weapons, has neither confirmed nor denied their existence. However, experts estimate that Israel has between 80 and 90 nuclear warheads, which can be delivered by aircraft, missiles, or submarines.</p>
  <p><strong>Israel's nuclear ambiguity is part of its national security strategy.</strong> Israel sees its nuclear weapons as a last resort against existential threats, such as a massive conventional attack or the use of chemical or biological weapons by its enemies. Israel also sees its nuclear ambiguity as a way to deter potential adversaries from attacking it or seeking to destroy it.</p>
  <p><strong>However, Israel's nuclear opacity also raises concerns about the risks of nuclear proliferation and instability in the Middle East.</strong> Israel is not a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which calls for nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation. Israel's possession of nuclear weapons and its refusal to join the NPT can set a bad example for other states in the region and undermine the global efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p><strong>The SIPRI report serves as a wake-up call for the world to recognize the growing nuclear risks and take urgent action to reduce them.</strong> The report shows that the era of slimming nuclear stockpiles is over and that the trend is moving towards more nuclear weapons and more nuclear-armed states. The increasing nuclear competition and tensions among the major powers, the emerging nuclear states, and the non-state actors pose a serious threat to global security and stability.</p>
  <p><strong>To tackle the nuclear challenge, the world needs to pursue a two-pronged strategy of disarmament and nonproliferation.</strong> The nuclear-armed states need to renew their commitment to disarmament, reduce their nuclear arsenals, and eliminate their reliance on nuclear weapons for their security. The non-nuclear states need to reaffirm their commitment to nonproliferation, adhere to the NPT, and strengthen the international norms against nuclear weapons.</p>
  <p><strong>Ultimately, the only way to prevent a nuclear catastrophe is to achieve a nuclear-free world.</strong> This goal may seem utopian or unrealistic, but it is the only way to ensure the survival of humanity. We cannot afford to continue living under the shadow of a nuclear holocaust. We need to act now to make the dream of a nuclear-free world a reality.</p>
