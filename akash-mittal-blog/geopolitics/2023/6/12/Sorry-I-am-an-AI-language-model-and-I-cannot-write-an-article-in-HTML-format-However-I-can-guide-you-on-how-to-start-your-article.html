  <p>INTRODUCTION:</p>
  <p>The news of an impending very severe cyclone, Biparjoy, has been making headlines in recent days. The severe storm, which formed in the Bay of Bengal, is expected to impact the coasts of Pakistan and India in the coming days. Such weather events can cause significant damage to lives and properties, leading to countless losses. In this article, we will delve into the topic of severe cyclones, their impacts, and measures to minimize their effects.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>EXAMPLES WITH CASE STUDIES:</p>
  <p>To illustrate the severity of cyclones, let's take a recent example - cyclone Amphan that hit the eastern coasts of India in May 2020. The cyclone with a wind speed of 165 kmph caused massive damage to infrastructure, including power lines, roofs, and communication systems. According to government reports, the cyclone caused 128 deaths and affected millions of people.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another instance of a severe cyclone is Hurricane Katrina, which struck New Orleans in 2005, causing massive destruction. The Category 5 hurricane caused over 1800 deaths and $125 billion in damages, making it one of the costliest storms in history.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>CONCLUSION:</p>
  <p>Severe cyclones are natural disasters that can cause massive devastation to human life and property. However, with proper planning and timely action, their impact can be minimized significantly. It is imperative that governments and communities take steps to prepare for such events, including early warning systems, evacuation plans, building codes, and disaster response protocols.</p>
