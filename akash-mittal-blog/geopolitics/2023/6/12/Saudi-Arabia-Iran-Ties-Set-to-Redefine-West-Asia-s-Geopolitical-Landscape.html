    <h2 class="subtitle">An Interesting Story</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time, in the region of West Asia, there were two major powers: Saudi Arabia and Iran. These two countries had been at odds with each other for decades due to religious and ideological differences. However, in recent years, there has been a shift in their relationship.</p>
    <h3>Examples with Case Studies</h3>
    <p>In 2019, Saudi Arabia and Iran participated together in the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. This was a historic moment as Saudi Arabia, the guardian of the holy sites of Islam, and Iran, a Shia Muslim country, had not participated together in nearly four years due to political tensions.</p>
    <p>Another example of this shift in relationship is the recent exchange of prisoners between Saudi Arabia and Iran. In September 2021, Saudi Arabia released three Iranian prisoners in exchange for the release of eight Saudis who had been imprisoned in Iran for several years. This exchange was seen as a positive development in improving relations between the two countries.</p>
