  <p></p>
  <p>In rural China, Chen Qingshan and his team are racing against time to solve the country's "soybean pain point". The challenge is clear: how to breed new soybean varieties faster and increase production capacity to achieve food self-sufficiency. But why are seeds such a big deal for China's national security?</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case Study 1: The US-China Trade War</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In 2018, China was hit hard by the US-China trade war, particularly because of the tariffs imposed on soybean imports from the US, its primary supplier. As a result, China had to look elsewhere for soybeans, causing an increase in prices and creating food security concerns. The incident revealed China's vulnerability to external factors.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case Study 2: The African Swine Fever Outbreak</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In 2019, China also faced an outbreak of African swine fever, a disease that killed millions of pigs across the country. This event had a significant impact on China's soybean demand because pig feed is one of soybeans' major uses. As a result, China had to import more soybeans, which further increased reliance on external sources and added more financial pressure to the economy.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case Study 3: The Climate Change Challenge</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The effects of climate change are also a major factor threatening China's food security. In recent years, China has suffered from floods, droughts, and extreme weather conditions that have disrupted crop yields and hampered food production. This situation has made China realize the urgency of developing new crop varieties that can withstand climate change and sustain agricultural productivity.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>For China, the development and preservation of seeds have become a matter of national security. The country's dependence on external sources jeopardizes its food security and economic stability. Therefore, China has prioritized seed breeding programs and invested heavily in research and development, trying to produce more, new, and better crop varieties that can help the country cope with different challenges.</p>
