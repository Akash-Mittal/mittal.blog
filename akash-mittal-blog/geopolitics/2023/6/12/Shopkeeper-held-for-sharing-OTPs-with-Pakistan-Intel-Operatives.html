   <p>Small actions can lead to big consequences. This has been proven by the recent arrest of a shopkeeper in Jajpur district, Odisha, for sharing OTPs (One-Time Passwords) with Pakistan Intelligence Operatives and Secret Service Agents.</p>
   <p>The accused, Pritam Kar, was arrested by the State Task Force officials on charges of espionage and anti-national activities. The investigation revealed that Kar was in touch with at least two PIO/ISI agents and had physically met them multiple times in other states.</p>
   <p>This incident serves as a grave reminder of how easily sensitive information can be compromised. The consequences of such actions can be severe and have far-reaching effects.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <h3>Case study 1: Chinese espionage activities:</h3>
   <p>Recently, a Chinese national was arrested in the US on charges of economic espionage. He was accused of stealing technology from his former employer, a US petroleum company, and sharing it with his Chinese associates. The company suffered a loss of over $1 billion due to this breach. This case highlights the dangers of economic espionage and how it can have severe consequences for companies and countries.</p>
   <h3>Case study 2: Russian hacking:</h3>
   <p>In 2016, Russian hackers interfered in the US presidential election by hacking into the Democratic National Committee's email system. The hackers leaked sensitive emails, which had a significant impact on the election outcome. This incident shows how foreign powers can use technology to interfere in other countries' internal affairs, causing chaos and instability.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Small actions can lead to severe consequences.</li>
    <li>The compromise of sensitive information can cause significant damage to companies and countries alike.</li>
    <li>Vigilance, awareness, and strict measures are necessary to prevent such incidents from occurring.</li>
   </ul>
