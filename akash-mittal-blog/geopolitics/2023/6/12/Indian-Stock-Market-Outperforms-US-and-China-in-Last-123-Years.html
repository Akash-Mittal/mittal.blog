   <p>A long-term study by DSP Mutual Fund has revealed that the Indian stock market has outperformed the US and China over the last 123 years. The study found that the Indian stock market delivered a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.6%, higher than the US with 6.4% and China with 3.3%, since the year 1900.</p>
   <h2>What Does This Mean for Investors?</h2>
   <p>The study implies that investing in the Indian stock market has been a wise decision for investors, and it is not just a recent trend. The Indian stock market has consistently ranked high in various global stock market rankings and has shown resilience during unforeseen events such as the global financial crisis of 2008.</p>
   <h2>History Reinforces the Latest Study</h2>
   <p>Historical data from Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) shows that the Indian stock market has been on a steady upward trend since the early 1900s. For example, in 1928, the BSE index was at 100, and today it stands at 51,000. This growth has been possible due to various factors such as the country's economic growth, demographics, political stability, and a growing middle class.</p>
   <h2>Case Studie 1: HDFC Bank</h2>
   <p>The Indian banking sector has seen tremendous growth in the last few decades, and it has contributed significantly to the Indian stock market's overall growth. One of the standout performers in the banking industry has been HDFC Bank. HDFC Bank has consistently delivered strong financial performance, and its stock price has witnessed a steady upward trend over the years. For instance, an investor who bought HDFC Bank stock in 2008 would have made more than 10 times their initial investment in 2021.</p>
   <h2>Case Study 2: Infosys</h2>
   <p>The Indian IT sector has also played a crucial role in the Indian stock market's growth, and one of the most consistent performers in the sector has been Infosys. Infosys is a multinational corporation that provides business consulting, information technology, and outsourcing services. Despite the pandemic, Infosys reported strong financial results in 2020 and continued to do so in 2021, resulting in a steady increase in its stock price.</p>
