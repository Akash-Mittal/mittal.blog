  <p>As the Cold War split the world into two camps starting in the 1950s, newly independent India became a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement — a group of countries that officially sided neither with Washington nor with Moscow. Today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has advanced an inverted version of the policy, picking and choosing relationships that he believes best suit India's interests. Most notably, the South Asian nation is deepening security links with the US — with which it shares concerns.</p>
  <h2>A Closer Look: India's Relationship with the US</h2>
  <p>In the 21st century, India has become an important strategic partner of the United States. Most notably, this has been driven by their mutual concerns over China. In recent years, India has increased its defense ties with the US. In 2018, the two countries signed the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA), which allows India to access advanced US defense systems.</p>
  <h3>Case Study: India in the Quad</h3>
  <p>The US has been working to strengthen its ties with India as a part of a larger diplomatic strategy aimed at containing Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific region. India is a crucial member of the US-led Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), which also includes Japan and Australia. The group aims to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific, and mitigate Chinese influence in the region.</p>
  <h3>Case Study: India's Weapons Deal with Russia</h3>
  <p>While India's relationship with the US is growing, it is also tied to Russia in areas such as arms deals. Recently, India signed a $5.2 billion deal with Russia for S-400 missile systems. This caused concern among US officials, who warned that the deal could result in sanctions under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).</p>
  <h2>Conclusion: India's Balancing Act</h2>
  <p>As India seeks to expand its strategic partnerships and strengthen its defense capabilities, it must balance its relationship with the US against its ties with Russia. India's strategic autonomy is not likely to change, but the country must be careful not to offend either the US or Russia. Ultimately, India's relationship with both nations will be defined by its own key interests and priorities.</p>
