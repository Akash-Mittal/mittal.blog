  <p>Recently, the Chinese government has asked the last Indian reporter in Beijing to leave the country. This is not the first time when China has taken such a step. In fact, all four journalists from India who were working in China this year have been asked to leave the neighboring country. This is definitely a matter of concern for the media fraternity as well as for the diplomatic relations between the two countries.</p>
  <h2>Why is it a serious concern?</h2>
  <p>China is a major player in the global economy and has a significant impact on the world affairs. It is important for the world to understand the happenings in China as it can affect the global political and economic scenario. The role of journalists in such contexts becomes crucial as they are the ones who bring the news and ground reality to the people. By asking Indian reporters to leave, China is limiting the flow of information and creating a blackout for the rest of the world.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <h3>1. Wuhan Coronavirus</h3>
  <p>During the early days of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, China was criticized for not sharing the information about the virus with the world. It was only after the situation got out of control that China shared the information with the World Health Organization (WHO). Had the news been reported earlier, WHO and other countries could have taken timely measures to control the spread of the virus. But by controlling the information flow, China jeopardized the health of millions of people around the world.</p>
  <h3>2. Hong Kong Protests</h3>
  <p>The Hong Kong protests have been going on for almost a year now and have been a major concern for the people of the region as well as for the global community. During the protests, there were allegations of police brutality and human rights violations in Hong Kong. But as Chinese media is heavily controlled by the government, it was difficult to get the real picture of what was happening in the region. By restricting the journalists, China has ensured that only a certain version of events is reported to the world, which may not be the complete truth.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The role of journalists in a democracy is of utmost importance. They are the voice of the people and bring the truth to light. By restricting the flow of information, China is undermining the freedom of expression and the right to information of its citizens as well as the rest of the world. This is a matter of concern not only for the media fraternity but for everyone who cares about democracy and transparency. Therefore, it is high time that the international community steps forward to question China's actions and hold them accountable for their actions.</p>
