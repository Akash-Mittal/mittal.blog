    <h2>The Outdated Power Game</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time, the world was divided into two superpowers - the United States and the Soviet Union. Countries aligned themselves with one or the other, and their security was dictated by this choice.</p>
    <p>Fast-forward to today, and the power dynamics have shifted. The Soviet Union no longer exists, and the U.S. is no longer the sole superpower. China has risen as a major player, and the Global South - comprising countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America - is seeking to forge its own path.</p>
    <p>However, despite this shift, the U.S. and Europe seem to be still playing an outdated power game. They continue to view themselves as the leaders of the free world, and often act unilaterally on the global stage. This has led to tension and mistrust with countries in the Global South.</p>
    <h2>Seeking Independent Ways</h2>
    <p>Let's take the example of Iran. The U.S. has had a long-standing policy of trying to isolate and pressure Iran because of its nuclear program. In 2015, however, Iran signed a deal with the U.S. and other countries, agreeing to curb its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief.</p>
    <p>Despite this, the U.S. unilaterally withdrew from the deal in 2018 and reinstated sanctions, causing Iran to slowly abandon its commitments. The European Union, which had also been a party to the deal, tried to salvage it by creating a mechanism to bypass U.S. sanctions and continue trading with Iran. However, this mechanism has been largely ineffective due to fears of U.S. retaliation.</p>
    <p>Another example is the case of Huawei, the Chinese tech giant. The U.S. has been pressuring its allies, including in Europe, to ban Huawei from their 5G networks due to concerns about espionage and national security. However, some European countries have resisted these calls, seeing it as an attempt by the U.S. to maintain its dominance in the tech sector.</p>
    <h2>Toward a Better Approach</h2>
    <p>If Europe wants to protect its security in the new world order, it needs to move away from this outdated power game and toward a more cooperative approach with the Global South. This means:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Respecting countries' sovereignty and independence, and engaging in dialogue rather than imposing policies unilaterally.</li>
     <li>Recognizing that the Global South has valuable contributions to make and partnering with these countries rather than seeing them as rivals or adversaries.</li>
     <li>Building a network of alliances and partnerships that are based on shared values and interests, rather than being solely rooted in military or economic power.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>By adopting this approach, Europe can develop a more nuanced and effective approach to protecting its security in the new world order.</p>
