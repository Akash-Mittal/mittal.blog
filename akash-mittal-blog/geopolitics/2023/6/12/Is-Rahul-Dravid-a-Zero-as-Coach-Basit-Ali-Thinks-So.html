   <h2>Introductory Story</h2>
   <p>Imagine a team of highly skilled players, each with the potential to become the next legend. But, their coach is unable to exploit their maximum potential and bring the best out of them. Will they ever be able to succeed and reach the heights of glory?</p>
   <p>This is what former Pakistan cricketer, Basit Ali believes is happening with the Indian cricket team under the coaching of Rahul Dravid.</p>
   <h2>The Statement by Basit Ali</h2>
   <p>In a recent statement, Ali ripped apart Dravid, calling him a â€˜zero' as a coach. Ali believes that India lost the match the moment they chose to field first, worrying about the overcast conditions. He further added that instead of playing to their strengths, India always try to cover up their weaknesses.</p>
   <h2>Case studies and Examples</h2>
   <p>There have been instances where India has struggled to perform under Dravid's coaching. One such example is the ODI series against Sri Lanka, where India lost 2-1. India was outclassed by Sri Lanka in all departments, and their lack of planning and strategies was quite evident.</p>
   <p>Another such instance is the recently concluded World Test Championship final, where India lost to New Zealand by 8 wickets. Many cricket experts blame India's poor shot selection and lack of adaptability to the conditions for their defeat.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, India has been inconsistent in their performances in T20Is, where they have struggled to find a stable batting order and bowling combination. This has resulted in their poor record in T20I World Cups, where they have never won the title despite being one of the strongest teams on paper.</p>
