  <p>Once upon a time, Bangladesh was commonly referred to as a "basket case" due to its persistent poverty and dismal economic conditions. However, in the recent years, the country has made remarkable progress in various areas of development and has surged ahead of India in the Human Development Index (HDI).</p>
  <p>The HDI is a composite parameter that takes into account various indicators such as life expectancy, education, and per capita income to measure a country's overall development. As per the latest report by the United Nations Development Programme, Bangladesh ranks 133rd while India ranks 139th in the HDI rankings.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Bangladesh's Progress in HDI</h2>
  <p>One of the key areas where Bangladesh has made significant strides is in the field of healthcare. The country has reduced its infant mortality rate from 92 per 1000 live births in 1990 to 28 per 1000 live births in 2018. Similarly, the under-five mortality rate has declined from 144 per 1000 live births in 1990 to 32 per 1000 live births in 2018. This is a remarkable achievement considering the fact that Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world.</p>
  <p>Another area where Bangladesh has outperformed India is in female education. The country has made tremendous progress in increasing the enrollment of girls in primary and secondary schools. In fact, the gender parity index for primary education in Bangladesh is 1.06, which is higher than India's 0.94. Additionally, the literacy rate for women in Bangladesh has increased from 26% in 1991 to 72% in 2018.</p>
  <p>Bangladesh has also made considerable progress in reducing poverty. In 2000, the poverty rate in the country was around 49%. However, by 2016, the poverty rate had declined to 24%. The country's poverty reduction strategy has focused on increasing rural incomes, promoting agriculture, and expanding social safety nets.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies of Bangladesh's Success in HDI</h2>
  <p>One of the success stories of Bangladesh's healthcare system is its successful campaign against tuberculosis (TB). The country has one of the highest rates of TB in the world, with an estimated 225,000 cases every year. However, the government has implemented a comprehensive program to fight against TB by establishing a network of diagnosis and treatment centers and by providing free medicines to patients. As a result, the rate of TB incidence has declined by 2.3% every year in Bangladesh, which is one of the highest rates of decline in the world.</p>
  <p>Another noteworthy example of Bangladesh's progress in education is its non-formal education program. The program targets out-of-school children and adults who cannot attend formal schools due to various reasons such as poverty, disability, or social exclusion. The program provides basic education in reading, writing, and numeracy skills to over four million students every year, which has helped to increase the literacy rate in the country.</p>
  <p>Bangladesh's success in poverty reduction can be attributed to the country's focus on microfinance. The country has pioneered the concept of microfinance, where small loans are provided to poor people to start their own businesses. Microfinance has not only helped in generating employment and income but has also empowered women as many of the beneficiaries are women who use the loans to start their own businesses and become financially independent.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The story of Bangladesh's progress in HDI is a testament to the fact that with the right policies and strategies, even the poorest of countries can achieve significant progress in various areas of development. Bangladesh's success in healthcare, education, and poverty reduction should serve as inspiration to other developing countries to take a cue from its model and work towards achieving a better future for their citizens.</p>
