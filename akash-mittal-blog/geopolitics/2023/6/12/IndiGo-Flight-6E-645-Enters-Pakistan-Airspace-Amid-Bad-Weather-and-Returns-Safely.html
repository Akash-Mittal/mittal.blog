   <p>On Saturday, IndiGo flight 6E-645 had to take a deviation over Atari into Pakistan airspace due to bad weather. The airline has reported that the flight returned safely from its journey.</p>
   <p>Many might think that entering Pakistan airspace would be something to be concerned about. However, this is not as uncommon as one might think, and IndiGo is not the only airline that has had to do so.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Airlines Entering Pakistan Airspace</h2>
   <p>In recent times, Pakistan has allowed airlines to use its airspace, which was closed for commercial flights in February 2019 due to tensions with India.</p>
   <p>The most significant impact has been the diversion of flights, especially those passing over Pakistan. According to The Economic Times, more than 2,000 flights had to be rerouted after Pakistan closed its airspace. For instance, Air India had to pay an extra $71,200 per day to fly its aircraft around Pakistan.</p>
   <p>However, since then, many airlines have started to use Pakistan airspace, including Air India, British Airways, Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways, and now IndiGo.</p>
   <p>This decision taken by Pakistan has kept in mind that when airspace is closed or there are restrictions on using it, airlines have to take more fuel, leading to higher costs, longer travel times, and pollution.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <h3>Emirates Flight to New York Diverts Into Pakistan Airspace Due to Bad Weather</h3>
   <p>On June 29th, Emirates flight EK-203, a Boeing 777 aircraft flying from Dubai to New York, had to make an unscheduled stop in Pakistan due to bad weather. The plane was supposed to make a layover at JFK airport, but it had to be diverted into Lahore, where it received clearance to transit through Pakistani airspace.</p>
   <p>Passengers reported that the crew informed them that they would be stopping in Lahore because of unexpected weather conditions. Many of them were relieved to know that there was an alternative plan without any complications.</p>
   <h3>British Airways Hails Direct Flights to Islamabad After Diverting for Decades</h3>
   <p>In September 2019, Pakistan announced that British Airways would resume its direct flights to Islamabad after a ten-year interruption. This decision followed the easing of travel restrictions to the country, which allowed visitors to obtain visas on arrival.</p>
   <p>British Airways has been successfully using Pakistan airspace for significant periods, and this new route was expected to save up to two hours of flight time each way, saving fuel costs and reducing emissions.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The decision by Pakistan to allow commercial flights to use its airspace is a smart move. It reduces fuel consumption and pollution while increasing revenue for the country's aviation sector. In addition, this decision has allowed airlines to save time and money, in turn, benefiting passengers in the long run.</p>
   <p>IndiGo flight 6E-645 returning safely to its destination after entering Pakistan airspace was a significant moment for the airline, highlighting the importance of being flexible and adapting to changes in the aviation industry.</p>
