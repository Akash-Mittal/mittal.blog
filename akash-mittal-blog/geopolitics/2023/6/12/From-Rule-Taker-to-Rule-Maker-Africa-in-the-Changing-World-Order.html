    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time, Africa was seen as a mere bystander in the global arena, waiting to be told what to do by the big powers. But that is changing rapidly. African countries are now beginning to assert themselves and their interests on the world stage. They no longer want to be rule-takers, but rather, rule-makers.</p>
    <p>For instance, African countries were instrumental in the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015. They fought hard to ensure that issues such as poverty, gender equality, and climate change were given due attention in this global agenda. This shows that Africa is capable of shaping the global discourse and influencing the decisions of the international community.</p>
    <p>However, Africa cannot do this alone. It needs to work with other like-minded countries to achieve its goals. This is where non-alignment comes in. Non-alignment does not mean neutrality or isolationism. Rather, it means that African countries should pursue policies that are in their best interests, without being beholden to any particular power bloc. By doing so, they can maintain their independence and autonomy, and work with any country or bloc that shares their values and interests.</p>

    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <h3>Case Study 1: African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA)</h3>
    <p>AfCFTA is a free trade agreement among African countries that came into effect in May 2019. It aims to create a single market for goods and services in Africa, with the potential to boost intra-African trade by 52.3%. This is a remarkable achievement, considering that intra-African trade is currently only at 17%.</p>
    <p>AfCFTA was not an easy feat, given the historical and structural barriers to intra-African trade. However, African countries showed their determination and resilience by forging ahead with this ambitious project. They recognized that the benefits of a free trade area far outweighed the challenges, and that Africa needed to speak with one voice to the rest of the world.</p>
    <h3>Case Study 2: High-Level Panel on Humanitarian Financing</h3>
    <p>In 2016, the United Nations Secretary-General convened a High-Level Panel on Humanitarian Financing, which included six African leaders. The panel was tasked with finding innovative ways to address the growing humanitarian crises around the world, especially in Africa.</p>
    <p>The panel's report, titled "Too Important to Fail - Addressing the Humanitarian Financing Gap", proposed a series of recommendations aimed at reducing the gap between the needs of people affected by crises and the resources available to help them. One of the key recommendations was to shift towards more predictable and sustained financing, rather than relying solely on ad hoc funding appeals.</p>
    <p>The African leaders on the panel played a critical role in highlighting the unique challenges facing Africa, such as the impact of climate change, conflict, and disease outbreaks. They also emphasized the need for more locally-led responses and greater investment in preparedness and prevention.</p>
