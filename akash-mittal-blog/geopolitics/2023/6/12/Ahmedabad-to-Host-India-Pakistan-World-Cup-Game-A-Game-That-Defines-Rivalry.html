  <p>Cricket is not just a sport in India, it's a religion. And when it comes to India vs Pakistan, it's a war that is being fought on the field. The streets become deserted, the televisions tuned in and the atmosphere electric. It's not just sports, it's emotions and rivalries that stand generations of conflicts.</p>
  <h2>The Build-Up: India vs Pakistan</h2>
  <p>It's no surprise that, even in a tournament, when India and Pakistan are slated to face each other, the stakes are higher, the rivalry more intense and the taglines more catchy. The history between the two subcontinent teams dates back to 1952 in Delhi, when they played their first ever test match. Ever since then, cricket between the two teams has gone way beyond the field, encompassing culture, politics and religion.</p>
  <p>But when it comes to the World Cup, the emotions multiply many folds. The 2019 World Cup game between India and Pakistan was the most watched cricket match ever, crossing over 1 billion viewers. A staggering number, but expected when the match is being talked about in the newsrooms, on social media and in the living rooms.</p>
  <h2>The Venue, the Draft and the Rivalry</h2>
  <p>Ahmedabad is slated to host the India vs Pakistan game in the upcoming World Cup. The anticipation, excitement and media frenzy, is already building up. The atmosphere will be electric and the reactions from both sides will be diverse.</p>
  <p>The excitement and hype for the game increased even further when the initial draft schedule was released, marking the start of the tournament with the reigning champions, England, taking on the last edition's runner-up, New Zealand. But for Indians, the World Cup starts only when India plays Pakistan.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies and Examples</h2>
  <p>The 2015 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand saw the two teams face each other in a high-pressure quarter-final game. India, the defending champions and Pakistan, with their eternal hopes of winning against India in a World Cup, but the momentum was with India. And what followed was one of the most comprehensive performances by any team in world cup history. With Kohli's innings of 107 and Shami's 5 wickets, India cruised to a victory and eliminated Pakistan from the tournament.</p>
  <p>The 2017 Champions Trophy final at London, also witnessed an intense match and a nail-biting finish. With Pakistan considered as the underdogs, they showed their mettle by scoring a mammoth 338 and then bowling out India at 158. It was a match that had everything, from Fakhar's century to Hafeez's fifty, it was a game that will be etched in cricket history forever.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion: A Game That Defines Rivalry</h2>
  <p>India vs Pakistan at the World Cup is what dreams are made of. The rivalry goes beyond cricket and is a combination of emotions, memories and the essence of a generation. The spotlight will be on the players, but their actions will be just a small part of a much bigger story. When a billion people tune in to watch a game, it's not just about the result, it's about the memories. And when India plays Pakistan in the World Cup, those memories are made for a lifetime.</p>
