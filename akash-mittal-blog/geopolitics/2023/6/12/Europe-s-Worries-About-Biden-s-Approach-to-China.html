  <p>When Joe Biden was elected as the 46th President of the United States, many Europeans breathed a sigh of relief, hopeful that he would restore America's role as a leader on the world stage. However, some Europeans are now worried about Biden's approach to China. They fear that the new administration's focus on competition with China could harm Europe's interests.</p>
  <h2>The Uncomfortable Relationship Between Europe and China</h2>
  <p>Europe's relationship with China is complicated. On one hand, China is Europe's second-largest trading partner, after the United States. In 2020, EU-China trade was worth over $700 billion. European companies also rely on China as a major manufacturing hub. On the other hand, European leaders are increasingly concerned about China's human rights abuses, its aggressive trade practices, and its growing military power.</p>
  <h2>The Divergence Between Europe and the US</h2>
  <p>While the United States has taken a hard line against China in recent years, Europe has been more cautious. The Trump administration's trade war with China was deeply unpopular in Europe, and many European leaders criticized Trump's unilateral approach. Some Europeans also worry that the Biden administration's emphasis on a "new Cold War" with China will lead to more conflict, rather than cooperation.</p>
  <h2>Examples of European Concerns</h2>
  <p>One area of concern for Europe is human rights. The EU has been vocal in condemning China's treatment of its Uighur Muslim minority, and has imposed sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for the repression. However, some European countries, such as Hungary and Greece, have been more hesitant to criticize China, because they rely on Chinese investment. This has led to tensions within the EU.</p>
  <p>Another area of concern is China's "Belt and Road" initiative, which involves building infrastructure projects throughout Asia, Europe, and Africa. While some European countries have welcomed Chinese investment in their infrastructure, others worry that China is using the initiative to expand its influence and undermine European unity.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Europe's relationship with China is complex and multifaceted. While European leaders recognize the need to balance economic interests with concerns about human rights and security, they are also mindful of the risks of escalating tensions with China. As the Biden administration rolls out its China policy, it will be important to engage in dialogue with Europe to ensure that the transatlantic alliance remains strong.</p>
