  <p class="intro">In a recent interview, ex-Pakistani cricketer Basit Ali took a direct dig at the Indian cricket team's head coach Rahul Dravid, calling him ‘absolutely zero' as a coach. However, is this criticism justified? Let's delve deeper to find the answer.</p>
  <h2 class="section-header">The Overcast Conditions</h2>
  <p>India recently lost the first Test match against England in Nottingham, and as expected, the critics were quick to blame the team's head coach. Basit Ali, in particular, claimed that India lost the match the moment they decided to field first after worrying about the overcast conditions. But here's the thing - Ali's criticism seems a bit one-dimensional, and here's why:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>After a stellar performance in the World Test Championship final against New Zealand, India went into the first Test with a lot of confidence.</li>
   <li>The Indian bowling unit, including the spinners, struggled to find the right length, which allowed the hosts to score a mammoth total in the first innings.</li>
   <li>The Indian batsmen failed to put up a good fight in the second innings, which eventually led to their downfall.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Clearly, India lost the match due to a combination of factors, and it would be unfair to blame all of it on the team's decision to field first.</p>
  <h2 class="section-header">Rahul Dravid as a Coach</h2>
  <p>Basit Ali claimed that Rahul Dravid is ‘absolutely zero' as a coach, but is this really true? Let's look at some of Dravid's achievements as a coach:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Dravid guided India's Under-19 team to the World Cup win in 2018.</li>
   <li>He was the head coach of the India A and India B teams that participated in the Deodhar Trophy and Duleep Trophy respectively.</li>
   <li>Several young Indian cricketers, including Rishabh Pant and Shubman Gill, have credited Dravid for their success.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Clearly, Rahul Dravid has been quite successful as a coach, but that doesn't mean he's perfect. Like any other coach, he too has his strengths and weaknesses.</p>
  <h2 class="section-header">Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, while Basit Ali's criticism of India's decision to field first may hold some weight, calling Rahul Dravid ‘absolutely zero' as a coach seems like a bit of a stretch. Dravid has had his share of successes as a coach, but he's not immune to criticism. Ultimately, the Indian cricket team's success doesn't solely depend on the head coach, but on every member of the team working together towards a common goal.</p><!-- References and hashtags -->
