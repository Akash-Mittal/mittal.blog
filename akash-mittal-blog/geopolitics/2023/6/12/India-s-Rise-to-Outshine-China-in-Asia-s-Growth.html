    <p>Once upon a time, India and China were considered to be neck-to-neck competitors in the race for economic growth and development. However, in recent years, India has emerged as the frontrunner in the region, leaving China behind in many aspects.</p>
    <p>Let's take a look at some examples with case studies to understand why India is predicted to outshine China as Asia remains a bright spot for global growth.</p>

    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <article>
     <h3>1. Manufacturing Sector</h3>
     <p>In 2019, India overtook China as the world's most attractive manufacturing destination, according to a survey conducted by Cushman &amp; Wakefield. The report cited India's demographic advantage of having a large young workforce, improving infrastructure, and ease of doing business as some of the reasons for its rise. China, on the other hand, is facing challenges such as rising wages, an ageing population, and increasing regulatory and political risks.</p>

     <h3>2. Startup Ecosystem</h3>
     <p>India has also been making waves in the startup ecosystem, with Bengaluru (also known as Bangalore) emerging as the startup capital of Asia. In 2019, India had a total of 26 unicorns (startups valued at over $1 billion), second only to the United States. On the other hand, China, which has had a head start in the startup race, is facing challenges such as a crackdown on internet companies and a slowing economy.</p>

     <h3>3. Renewable Energy</h3>
     <p>By 2022, India is set to become the world's third-largest solar market after China and the United States, according to a report by the International Energy Agency. The report cites India's ambitious targets for renewable energy and its rapidly falling prices as the primary reasons for its rise. India's installed solar capacity has increased fivefold since 2015, while China's solar growth has slowed down in recent years due to policy changes and a subsidy cut.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>India's rise to outshine China in Asia's growth is not a fluke, but a result of years of sustained efforts and policies. While both countries have their strengths and weaknesses, India seems to have an edge in areas such as manufacturing, startups, and renewable energy. However, this does not mean that India can afford to be complacent, as it faces several challenges such as unemployment, inequality, and bureaucratic red tape.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, India's potential as a global economic powerhouse cannot be ignored, and it is high time that the world takes notice of it.</p>
