  <h1>Amid Media Row, China Tells Last Indian Reporter to Leave</h1></br> <img src="images/Amid-Media-Row-China-Tells-Last-Indian-Reporter-to-Leave.jpeg" alt="+Amid-Media-Row-China-Tells-Last-Indian-Reporter-to-Leave+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://m.timesofindia.com/india/media-row-china-tells-last-indian-reporter-to-leave/articleshow/100934810.cms" target="_blank" href="https://m.timesofindia.com/india/media-row-china-tells-last-indian-reporter-to-leave/articleshow/100934810.cms" rel="noopener">https://m.timesofindia.com/india/media-row-china-tells-last-indian-reporter-to-leave/articleshow/100934810.cms</a></span></h5>
  <p>On September 6th, 2021 the last Indian journalist operating in China was asked to leave the country by the end of the month, in a tit-for-tat move amid an intensifying media row between the two neighboring countries. This decision followed a month after India expelled three Chinese journalists working in New Delhi for allegedly violating rules on what can be published in India.</p>
  <h2>The Media Row Between India and China</h2>
  <p>Diplomatic tensions have been escalating between India and China, and it seems that the media is caught up in this geopolitical battle. India and China have been in a long-standing border dispute, which turned violent in 2020. This led to the death of 20 Indian soldiers and an unconfirmed number of Chinese troops in Ladakh's Galwan Valley. Since then, tensions have been high between the two countries, and it seems that the media is the latest victim in this battle.</p>
  <p>Earlier this year, China expelled several foreign journalists, including American journalists for their reporting. India then followed up by expelling three journalists from China's state-run Xinhua news agency. This seems to have led to China's decision to remove the last Indian journalist from their country.</p>
  <h2>The Effect on Journalism and International Relations</h2>
  <p>This ongoing media row is an example of how journalism is facing geopolitical challenges. With countries increasingly trying to control the narrative to suit their agenda, the role of journalists in reporting the truth is becoming more difficult. It also highlights the impact that diplomatic tensions can have on international journalism.</p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>The media row between India and China is likely to continue as long as the diplomatic tensions between the two countries remain high. It is important to remember that the freedom of the press is one of the cornerstones of democracy, and it is the responsibility of journalists to report the truth, regardless of the political atmosphere.</p>
