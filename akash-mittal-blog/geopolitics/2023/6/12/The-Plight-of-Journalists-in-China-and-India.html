  <p>Journalists are known for their duty to report the truth and expose corruption anywhere around the world. However, in recent years, it has become increasingly difficult for journalists working in China and India to practice their profession freely without government interference. In this article, we will take a look at the plight of journalists in China and India and examine the reasons behind the restrictions they face.</p>
  <h2>Journalists in China</h2>
  <p>China has strict media regulations and has been known to censor and control news to maintain a positive image of the country. Foreign journalists are required to have a government-issued visa and need permission to visit certain areas or to conduct an interview. Even after obtaining the necessary permits, foreign journalists are constantly monitored and may face harassment or obstruction from government officials or ordinary citizens.</p>
  <p>A recent case is that of Australian journalist Cheng Lei, who has been detained in Beijing since August 2020 and charged with "endangering national security." Lei had worked for the Chinese state-owned English language channel, CGTN, but had criticized the Chinese regime on social media. Lei is one of several journalists from Western countries who have been detained in China, and the situation has become worse since the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
  <h2>Journalists in India</h2>
  <p>India has a vibrant and free press, but in recent years, there have been increasing concerns about censorship, harassment, and violence against journalists who report on sensitive topics such as corruption, human rights abuses, and communal tensions. The government has used various laws such as sedition, criminal defamation, and the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act to silence critical voices and target journalists.</p>
  <p>A prominent case is that of Kishorechandra Wangkhem, a journalist from Manipur, who was arrested under the National Security Act in 2018 for criticizing the state government on Facebook. Wangkhem was released after a court ordered his release, but he continued to face harassment and threats from the authorities.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The lack of press freedom in China and India is a worrying trend that hinders the promotion of transparency, accountability, and democracy. Governments should respect the rights of journalists to report without fear of reprisal and ensure that their safety and security are protected. The international community should support journalists and media outlets in their efforts to shine a light on issues that affect society. As a society, we have a responsibility to defend the values of free speech and press freedom.</p>
