  <p>Once upon a time, India and China were two ancient civilizations that shared the same continent but had little contact with each other. But in recent times, their paths have crossed more frequently, as they compete for influence and economic power in Asia and beyond.</p>
  <p>It is against this backdrop that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the United States in September 2021 takes on added significance. The trip will provide an opportunity for India to further strengthen its ties with the US, one of its key strategic partners, and to signal its intention to play a larger role in shaping the future of Asia.</p>
  <h2>Examples of India's Rising Power</h2>
  <p>India's rise as a major world power has been driven by a combination of economic growth, military strength, and diplomacy. Here are a few examples:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>India is the world's fifth largest economy in terms of nominal GDP and the third largest by purchasing power parity.</li>
   <li>India is also the world's third largest military spender, behind only the US and China.</li>
   <li>India has been an active participant in global diplomacy, especially in forums like the United Nations.</li>
   <li>India has emerged as a leader in cutting-edge industries like information technology and pharmaceuticals.</li>
   <li>India has a young and dynamic population that is highly educated and entrepreneurial.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Case Studies of India's Strategic Partnerships</h2>
  <div class="case">
   <h3>India and the US: An Enduring Partnership</h3>
   <p>The relationship between India and the US has come a long way since the Cold War era, when India pursued a policy of non-alignment and the US was seen as a rival to India's ally, the Soviet Union. Today, the two countries are close strategic partners, with shared interests in areas like counterterrorism, trade, and democracy.</p>
   <p>One of the most important aspects of the India-US relationship is the defense partnership. India is one of the largest buyers of US weapons and military hardware, and the two countries conduct regular joint exercises. In addition, the US has been a key supporter of India's bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.</p>
   <p>The trade relationship between India and the US has also grown significantly in recent years. The two countries have set a target of $500 billion in bilateral trade by 2025, up from $149 billion in 2019. The US is India's second largest trading partner, after China.</p>

  <div class="case">
   <h3>India and Japan: The Asia-Africa Growth Corridor</h3>
   <p>India and Japan have been building closer ties in recent years, based on shared interests in areas like regional security, economic development, and technology cooperation. One of the main initiatives between the two countries is the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor, which aims to promote economic growth and connectivity in Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
   <p>The Asia-Africa Growth Corridor is seen as a counterweight to China's Belt and Road Initiative, which has raised concerns about debt sustainability and political influence in recipient countries. The Japan-India partnership is focused on high-quality infrastructure development, technology sharing, and capacity building, with an emphasis on environmental sustainability and social responsibility.</p>
   <p>The India-Japan relationship has also grown in the defense and security area, with Japan becoming one of India's key partners in the Quad, a grouping of four democracies (India, Japan, the US, and Australia) that is seen as a hedge against China's rise in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion: Three Key Takeaways</h2>
  <div class="conclusion">
   <h2>1. India is on the rise, but faces challenges</h2>
   <p>India's rise as a major world power is undeniable, but it faces significant challenges, both at home and abroad. At home, India must continue to address issues like corruption, inequality, and social unrest, while also investing in education, healthcare, and infrastructure. Abroad, India must navigate a shifting geopolitical landscape, marked by great power competition and regional rivalries.</p>
   <h2>2. India's strategic partnerships are key to its success</h2>
   <p>India's strategic partnerships with countries like the US, Japan, and Australia are key to its success on the international stage. These partnerships provide India with access to capital, technology, and markets, as well as political support in multilateral forums. They also help to balance against China's growing influence in the region.</p>
   <h2>3. PM Modi's US visit will be a turning point</h2>
   <p>PM Modi's visit to the US in September 2021 will be a crucial moment in India's rise as a major world power. It will provide an opportunity for India to deepen its ties with the US, strengthen its strategic partnerships, and signal its intention to play a larger role in shaping the future of Asia. The visit comes at a time when the world is grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, economic uncertainty, and geopolitical tensions, making it all the more important for India to show its leadership and vision.</p>
