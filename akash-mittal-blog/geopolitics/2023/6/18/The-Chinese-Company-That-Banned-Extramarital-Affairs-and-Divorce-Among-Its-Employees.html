  <p>The world has seen some bizarre company rules, but a Chinese firm has come up with one that is the oddest yet. The company is demanding its staff to refrain from extramarital affairs or getting divorced; otherwise, they will lose their jobs.</p>
  <p>The company has become a topic for discussion on social media, and many people are stunned by the rule. Interestingly, the company did not stop at banning an extramarital affair alone. They also threatened to terminate any worker who gets divorced. The idea was hatched by a company worker who claims that the company was struggling with poor job performance among married workers, whose personal life was interfering with their proficiency on the job.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Employer's Company Rules</h2>
  <p>Many companies have a code of conduct that employees need to follow. However, while most of these codes are logical, others are bizarre. Here are examples of recent and odd company rules:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>A pharmaceutical company fined its workers for parking in the wrong company designated parking lot</li>
   <li>A tech firm made its employees employ a hashtag whenever they posted tweets about the company</li>
   <li>A Chinese company banned its employees from holding drinks while walking in the workplace or while standing with other workers.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>For years, most people have thought that a company should not get involved in the employee's private life. However, here is how this latest Chinese company's rule makes sense:</p>
  <p>Some employees might go through a challenging situation in their relationship with their partner, which could lead to arguments, disagreements, and other complications. However, these employees still have to show up for work and complete their work exceptionally well. Emotional instability brought by their private lives could lead to poor job performance.</p>
  <p>A divorce could be a long process filled with stress, financial hardship, or emotional trauma, which could impact an employee's daily productivity. Companies estimate that the termination of these workers is more cost-effective than allowing their personal life to impact their job performance and, ultimately, their long-term success in the workplace.</p>
  <p>However, other people argue that the company's interference with an employee's private life could lead to distrust among employees, which could carry long-lasting effects on the company. Intruding could lead to the employees' morale plummeting, and they might look for other employment opportunities.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion (in 3 points)</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>While the company's rule might seem bizarre, it makes sense from the company's standpoint.</li>
   <li>The privacy of employee's personal life should be respected, but it should not affect their job performance.</li>
   <li>There is a fine line between the company's expectations of employee's productivity and the employee's privacy.</li>
  </ol>
