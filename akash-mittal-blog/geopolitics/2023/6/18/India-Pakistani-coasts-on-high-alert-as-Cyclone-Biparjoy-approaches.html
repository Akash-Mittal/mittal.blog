   <p>On a cloudy day in the summer of 1999, a massive cyclone hit the coast of Odisha, causing widespread destruction and claiming over 10,000 lives. The cyclone, known as Super Cyclone 05B, was the deadliest in the history of India. Since then, the country has come a long way in terms of disaster management and preparedness. With Cyclone Biparjoy expected to make landfall in the next 24 hours, the Indian and Pakistani coasts are on high alert.</p>
   <h2>Preparedness Measures</h2>
   <p>The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a warning for Cyclone Biparjoy and has advised people to stay indoors. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has deployed teams in both India and Pakistan, and warning signals have been hoisted at ports and harbors to alert ships and fishermen.</p>
   <p>Authorities have also set up relief camps and identified potential evacuation areas. The Army, Airforce, and Navy have been put on standby to assist in rescue operations. District officials have been instructed to stay on high alert and keep a close watch on the situation. Helpline numbers have been issued, and citizens have been advised to stay abreast of updates and follow instructions issued by authorities.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <p>Cyclones have caused significant damage and loss of life in the Indian subcontinent in the past. In 2004, a cyclone hit the coast of Tamil Nadu, causing widespread flooding, debris, and loss of around 8000 lives. However, in 2019, Cyclone Fani hit the coast of Odisha, and thanks to the resilience and preparedness of the people and authorities, only 64 deaths were reported, despite it being one of the strongest cyclones to hit the region in two decades.</p>
   <p>Apart from preparedness measures, India has also been working on strengthening its disaster resilience infrastructure. For example, the Odisha State Disaster Management Authority has been recognized internationally for its proactive and innovative management techniques. In addition, India has developed a Global Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) to help countries develop sustainable and resilient infrastructure.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Disaster preparedness measures are crucial for mitigating the impact of natural disasters like cyclones.</li>
    <li>India and Pakistan's coordinated efforts and preparedness measures are commendable.</li>
    <li>Investment in resilience infrastructure is crucial for building sustainable and disaster-resilient communities.</li>
