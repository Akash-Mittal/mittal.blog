    <p>Once, a wise man said: "Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printed. Everything else is public relations." The statement still holds true today as the role of journalists in society remains vital for establishing accountability and transparency.</p>
    <p>However, this freedom to report is under threat as countries often resort to expelling or censoring journalists who uncover unpleasant truths or reports that governments do not want publicized.</p>
    <p>Recently, China has expelled two Indian journalists over alleged "unfair treatment" of its reporters. The move has raised questions about China's commitment to press freedom and its willingness to facilitate fair and transparent journalism.</p>
    <h2>The Expulsion of Indian Journalists</h2>
    <p>China's Foreign Ministry announced on 22nd August 2020 that it had expelled two Indian journalists working for "The Hindu" newspaper.</p>
    <p>According to reports, their expulsion follows a standoff between the Indian and Chinese army in the Ladakh region. Both countries have accused each other of violating a bilateral agreement by sending troops and guns to their border.</p>
    <p>As a response, China's Foreign Ministry alleged that Indian media published some reports that violated China's territorial sovereignty, public security, and interests. Thus, two Indian journalists had their visas cancelled, and they were asked to leave.</p>
    <p>The expulsion of the Indian journalists is not new as it follows a trend of several journalists being expelled from different countries as they attempt to report on issues that powerful people or their governments do not want publicized.</p>
    <h2>Examples of Journalists Expulsion in the Recent Past</h2>
    <p>Journalists have been expelled from several countries, including the United States, Russia, Turkey, and Egypt, among others. Below are some prominent cases:</p>
    <h3>United States</h3>
    <p>In 2018, the U.S. withdrew Ecuador's Vice-Counsel to New York, Gloria Berbena, after she posted on Facebook praising Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. The statement was deemed inconsistent with her diplomatic duties, and thus the U.S. government withdrew her rights to travel there.</p>
    <h3>Turkey</h3>
    <p>During the 2016 coup attempt in Turkey, over 150 journalists were arrested for "supporting" or "participating" in the attempted coup. Later, several foreign correspondents had their press credentials revoked, and they were asked to leave the country.</p>
    <h3>Russia</h3>
    <p>In December 2020, a Russian court sentenced journalist Andrei Borodin to six months in prison over a tweet supporting an opposition figure. Later, in February 2021, he was deported to Germany, and his apartment was searched and sealed.</p>
    <h3>Egypt</h3>
    <p>In 2016, the Egyptian government deported a journalist from Al-Jazeera's English-language channel, Mahmoud Hussein, accusing him of spreading false news and belonging to a banned organization.</p>
    <h2>The Need for Free and Fair Journalism</h2>
    <p>The freedom and safety of journalists remain a concern as they operate in an environment plagued by censorship, propaganda, and misinformation. The suppression of the free press stifles democracy, human rights, and civic liberties, making it more difficult to hold governments accountable and demand transparency from other power-wielding institutions.</p>
    <p>Both China and India have made significant strides economically and geopolitically. However, this does not mean that they are immune to criticism or shielded from scrutiny. Journalists play an essential role in holding these countries accountable to their citizens and the wider international community.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The mission of journalism is more critical than ever to demand transparency and facilitate a robust and open democratic debate. The expulsion of Indian journalists from China raises questions about China's commitment to press freedom and fair journalism. Governments worldwide must prioritize the safety and protection of journalists. This should involve investigating and halting violence against journalists, decriminalizing journalism, and respect for press freedom.</p>
    <p>Journalism is a noble profession, and it is essential to power checks and balances in society. However, it is challenging for journalists to do their job with declining press freedom globally. Therefore, it is critical to recognize the critical role of journalism in shaping society and putting pressure on the government's accountability and transparency, paving the way for democracy to thrive.</p>
