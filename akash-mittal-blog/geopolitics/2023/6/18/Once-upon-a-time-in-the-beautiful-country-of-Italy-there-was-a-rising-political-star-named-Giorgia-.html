  <p></p>
  <p>But there was a force that wanted to tame her. It was the combination of neoliberalism, geopolitics, and ideology that dictated the rules of the game. Giorgia Meloni had to conform to these rules if she wanted to achieve her political ambitions. This is a story about how a promising politician was transformed in the hands of the powerful elites.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Neoliberalism is the economic doctrine that values privatization, free trade, and market deregulation. In the context of politics, it means that politicians have to align with the interests of the market forces. If they want to attract investments, they have to create conditions that are friendly to businesses. In the case of Giorgia Meloni, this meant that she had to moderate her anti-immigration stance. Italy, like most European countries, depends on immigrant labor to keep its economy afloat. If Meloni wanted to attract investments, she had to create a perception that immigrants were not a threat to the country's stability.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Geopolitics is about the power relations between states. It's about how countries assert their influence over others. In the context of Italy, it means that the country has to align with the interests of the European Union. Italy is a member of the EU, and its economy is interconnected with other EU member countries. If Italy wants to exert influence over the continent, it has to negotiate from a position of strength. This is where Meloni had to tread carefully. Her far-right ideology was perceived as a threat to the unity of the EU. If she wanted to be taken seriously as a politician, she had to create a perception that she was not a Eurosceptic.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Finally, ideology is about the beliefs and values that guide political decision-making. It's about the worldviews that politicians bring to the table. In the case of Giorgia Meloni, her ideology was shaped by her far-right beliefs. She believed in the superiority of the Italian culture and the need to preserve it. But her ideology was at odds with the prevailing neoliberal and geopolitical currents. If she wanted to succeed in politics, she had to align her ideology with the interests of the elites.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case Study 1: The Taming of Giorgia Meloni</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Giorgia Meloni was the leader of the far-right political party, Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy). Fratelli d'Italia was founded in 2012 as an ultraconservative party that promotes nationalism and anti-immigration. Meloni quickly became the face of the party. She was young, articulate and had a growing number of supporters.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>However, her party's far-right ideology was out of touch with mainstream politics. Italy was in the grip of economic recession, and the country needed investments to jump-start its economy. Meloni's anti-immigration stance was seen as a threat to the interests of foreign investors. The EU was also concerned about her far-right beliefs. Italy was an important member of the Union, and any threat to its unity was viewed with suspicion.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Meloni understood that she had to tone down her rhetoric if she wanted to be taken seriously. She began to moderate her anti-immigration stance and started to focus more on economic issues. In 2016, she made a bold move by meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The meeting was a signal that she was not a Eurosceptic and was open to dialogue with the EU.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Meloni's efforts paid off in the 2018 general election. Her party achieved a surprising result, winning 4% of the vote and gaining 19 seats in the parliament. Meloni's transformation from a far-right politician to a mainstream one was complete. She had successfully tamed her ideology to meet the demands of the powerful elites.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case Study 2: Matteo Salvini and the European Elections</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Matteo Salvini was the leader of the far-right political party, Lega Nord (Northern League). He was known for his anti-immigration stance and his Eurosceptic beliefs. Salvini's rise to power was fueled by his ability to appeal to the frustrations of ordinary Italians. He promised to protect their jobs, their culture and their way of life from the threats of globalization and immigration.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Salvini's popularity grew to such an extent that he became the Deputy Prime Minister of Italy in 2018. He used his position to push his anti-immigration agenda and to challenge the EU on issues such as fiscal austerity. He became the face of the far-right movement in Europe.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In the 2019 European elections, Salvini's Lega Nord achieved a stunning victory, winning 34% of the vote and becoming the largest party in Italy. Salvini's anti-immigration stance and his Eurosceptic beliefs had struck a chord with the Italian electorate.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>However, what Salvini didn't realize was that his victory was not entirely his own. He was helped by the backing of powerful interests that wanted to use his popularity to advance their own agenda. These interests included the powerful Italian business lobby, the EU and the United States.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Salvini's victory was short-lived. In August 2019, he lost his position as Deputy Prime Minister after his coalition partner, the Five Star Movement, withdrew their support. Salvini's taming was complete. He had been used by the powerful elites for their own interests, and then discarded when he was no longer of use.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The taming of Giorgia Meloni and Matteo Salvini is a cautionary tale of how politics is shaped by economic, geopolitical, and ideological forces. To succeed in politics, politicians have to align themselves with the interests of the elites. They have to moderate their beliefs, tone down their language, and present a perception that they are not a threat to the existing order.</p>

  <p></p>
  <p>1. Neoliberalism, geopolitics, and ideology are powerful forces that shape politics.</p>
