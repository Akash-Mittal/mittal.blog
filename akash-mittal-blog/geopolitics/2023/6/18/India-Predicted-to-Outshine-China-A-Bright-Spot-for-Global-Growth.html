But in recent years, India has been making significant strides in various sectors, from technology to pharmaceuticals. As a result, experts predict that India may finally outshine China as a bright spot for global growth.</p>

   <h2>Examples of India's Growing Dominance</h2>
   <p>India's rise as a global economic powerhouse becomes clear from various examples:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>India's IT sector has been thriving for decades, with major players like TCS, Infosys, and Wipro leading the way. The rise of digital technologies and big data has given a further boost to the sector, which is expected to surpass $300 billion by 2025.</li>
    <li>Pharmaceuticals is another sector where India has established a significant presence. The country is known for producing low-cost but high-quality generic drugs, which are in high demand worldwide. In fact, Indian firms supply over 20% of the global generic drug market.</li>
    <li>India is also becoming a leader in renewable energy, with ambitious targets to install 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022. The country has already surpassed its initial target and is on track to achieve the higher goal.</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <p>Let's take a look at some specific case studies that illustrate India's growing dominance in various sectors:</p>
   <h3>TCS</h3>
   <p>Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is one of the largest IT services firms in India and the world. With over 400,000 employees in 46 countries, TCS has been a major player in the digital transformation of businesses worldwide. In 2020, TCS became the second Indian company to achieve a $100 billion market cap, after Reliance. This achievement underscores the growing importance of India's tech sector in the global economy.</p>
   <h3>Cipla</h3>
   <p>Cipla is a leading Indian pharmaceutical company that specializes in generic drugs. The company has a strong presence in over 80 countries and aims to make medicine affordable and accessible to all. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Cipla ramped up the production of key drugs such as Remdesivir and Tocilizumab, which have been used to treat severe cases of the disease. Such efforts demonstrate India's potential to become a major player in global healthcare.</p>
   <h3>Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI)</h3>
   <p>The Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) is a government agency that promotes the development of renewable energy in the country. SECI has been instrumental in driving down the cost of solar energy by conducting transparent auctions that attract global investors. In 2020, SECI oversaw the installation of the world's largest solar park in Gujarat, which is expected to produce 2 GW of solar power. Such initiatives show India's commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and meeting its energy needs sustainably.</p>
