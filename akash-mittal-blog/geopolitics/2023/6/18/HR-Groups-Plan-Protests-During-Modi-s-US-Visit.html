   <p>In 2015, an Indian software engineer in the US, Srinivas Kuchibhotla, was shot dead by a man who shouted, "get out of my country." Kuchibhotla's friend, also Indian, was injured in the shooting. These incidents were a wake-up call for the Indian community in the US. Now, as India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, is set to visit the United States, human rights (HR) groups in the country are planning protests in opposition to his visit.</p>
   <p>The protests against Modi's visit are because of his government's alleged involvement in human rights violations in India. However, the Indian-American community is also divided on the subject. Those who support Modi's policies believe that he is instrumental in the country's development and making India a superpower. In contrast, those who oppose Modi's policies accuse him of religious discrimination and suppressing dissenting voices.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Human Rights Violations in India</h2>
   <p>Human Rights Watch, an international human rights advocacy organization, has documented cases of religious discrimination in India. According to them, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is Modi's party, has fueled tensions between Muslims and Hindus by promoting Hindu nationalism. In addition to this, Kashmir, which is a Muslim-majority state in India, has been under military lockdown since August 2019. The region had curfews imposed, with internet access and communication lines were cut. In this ongoing conflict, approximately 8,000 people, including minors, have been arrested, and there have been reports of human rights abuses, torture, and deaths.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <p>The National Register of Citizens (NRC), which was implemented by Modi's government in Assam, has stripped over two million people of their citizenship. The aim of NRC is to identify illegal immigrants in India. However, in implementing this policy, the government has targeted Muslims and rendered them stateless. Those who have been affected by the NRC are now at risk of being deported to detention centers or living in abject poverty.</p>
   <p>Another case that highlights religious discrimination in India is when the government passed the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The act did not include Muslims as a part of the cut-off date to claim citizenship in India, while other minorities such as Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, and Jains were granted citizenship. There were widespread protests throughout India against the discriminatory nature of the legislation.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The upcoming protests against Modi's US visit highlight the ongoing human rights violations in India. The leader of the world's largest democracy must be held accountable for the policies that discriminate against minorities and suppress dissent. The following are three crucial points to consider:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>The Indian-American community is divided in its support of Modi's policies, which may lead to a polarized approach to the protests against his visit.</li>
    <li>The protests against Modi's visit are a reminder that human rights violations in India continue to be a significant concern.</li>
    <li>The US as a global leader should use this opportunity to reaffirm its commitment to human rights and hold discussions with Modi challenging the ongoing human rights violations in India.</li>
   </ol>
