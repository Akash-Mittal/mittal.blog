   <p>It was a hot summer day in Lahore when Mr. Aamir, a small business owner, was struggling to keep his shop running. He had invested all his savings into his business, however, things were not as he had imagined them to be. Sales were low, expenses were high, and debts were piling up.</p>
   <p>One day, while sitting in his shop, Mr. Aamir heard about the benefits of trading with India. He was skeptical at first, considering the historical tension between the two countries. However, he did his research and realized that trade could potentially provide a solution to his economic woes.</p>
   <p>India is the largest neighboring country of Pakistan and has the potential to become one of the main trading partners of Pakistan. With a population of 1.4 billion and a GDP of $2.7 trillion, India is a huge market for Pakistani goods and services. Let's explore how the solution to Pakistan's economic woes lies in trade with India.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Trade between Pakistan and India</h2>
   <p>India and Pakistan have a history of political tension which has negatively impacted their trade relationship. However, both countries have immense potential to benefit from each other's markets.</p>
   <p>Currently, Pakistan exports goods worth around $250 million to India, whereas its imports from India are valued at approximately $2.5 billion. This trade imbalance can be addressed by increasing Pakistan's exports to India.</p>
   <p>India has a large demand for Pakistani products such as textiles, spices, dried fruits, and handicrafts. Pakistan can also export its agricultural products such as rice, mangoes, and poultry to India.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, Pakistan can import essential items from India such as petroleum products, electrical machinery, and chemicals. The increase in trade between the two countries can help Pakistan to revive its economy.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <p>If we look at the successful bilateral trade agreements between India and its neighboring countries, we can see the potential that trade holds for the economic development of a country. Two examples of such agreements include:</p>
   <h3>India-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (ISFTA)</h3>
   <p>India and Sri Lanka signed the ISFTA in 1998, which constitutes a comprehensive free trade agreement between the two countries. The agreement aims to enhance trade and investment flows between the two countries by eliminating barriers to trade. Since the agreement was signed, bilateral trade between India and Sri Lanka increased from $658 million in 1999-2000 to $6.5 billion in 2018-19.</p>
   <h3>India-Bhutan Free Trade Agreement (IBFTA)</h3>
   <p>India and Bhutan have a Free Trade Agreement, which came into effect in 2007. The agreement aims to promote trade and economic cooperation between the two countries. As per the agreement, Bhutan can export its hydroelectricity to India, while India can export essentials such as petrol, diesel, and spices to Bhutan. The bilateral trade between India and Bhutan has increased from $494 million in 2017-18 to $548 million in 2018-19.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>Trade with India can act as a solution to Pakistan's economic woes. The increase in bilateral trade can help in reducing the trade imbalance between the two countries. Pakistan has the potential to export its products to India and imports essential items in return. This will boost the country's economy and create job opportunities for its citizens. In summary, the solution to Pakistan's economic woes lies in trade with India.</p>
   <p>The key takeaways from this article are:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Trade can be a solution to Pakistan's economic woes.</li>
    <li>Pakistan can export its products to India to reduce the trade imbalance.</li>
    <li>India can export essentials to Pakistan in return.</li>
   </ul>
