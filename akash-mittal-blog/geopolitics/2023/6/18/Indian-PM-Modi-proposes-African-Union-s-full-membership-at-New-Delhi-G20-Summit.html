  <p>The India-Africa relationship goes back centuries, with both countries having a shared history and a harmonious relationship. In 2021, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed the addition of the African Union as a full member of the G20 Summit which is held every year and has the most significant global economies of the world. This gesture goes to show how vital India and Africa's partnership is and how much the Indian government values it.</p>
  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p>The Indian government has collaborated with several African countries to provide aid in areas such as healthcare, education, and information technology. The partnership between India and Africa has seen a significant rise in recent years. For instance, India has extended over $10 billion in lines of credit to African countries. As well, India has been providing food assistance to African Nations during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>One of the most significant projects undertaken by the Indian government in partnership with Africa is the Pan-African e-Network project, which has enabled the connectivity of African countries through a satellite and fiber-optic network. This project has provided African nations access to world-class education and healthcare facilities that are available in India. The project is a shining example of how India and Africa are working together to bridge the gap and provide better access to communication channels, bringing people closer together.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The partnership between India and Africa is a vital part of the international community. It shows how both countries can work together to solve problems faced by the world. India's proposal of the African Union's full membership at the G20 summit is a testament to the long-standing relationship between the two continents. This partnership exhibits the strong unity and cooperation between India and Africa, which can foster further positions in good challenges, leading innovations, and creating opportunities for all.</p>
