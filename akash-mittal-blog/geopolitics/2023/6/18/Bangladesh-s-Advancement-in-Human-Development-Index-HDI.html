    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>In the early 1990s, Bangladesh was regarded as one of the poorest countries in the world, with a high rate of infant mortality, malnutrition, and illiteracy. But with the implementation of innovative policies, determined leadership and relentless investment towards education, health and economic development, Bangladesh has made unprecedented progress in the Human Development Index (HDI) since then.</p>
    <p>According to the Human Development Report by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Bangladesh made a significant improvement in its HDI ranking from 162 out of 189 countries in 2017 to 135 out of 189 countries in 2020. As a neighboring country, India's ranking is 131 out of 189 countries in 2020. This clearly shows that Bangladesh has made remarkable progress ahead of India on the parameters of HDI.</p>

   <section id="examples">
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>One of the major factors that have propelled Bangladesh forward is its commitment to education. Bangladesh has one of the highest levels of enrollment in primary education, which is almost universal now. Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) in primary education increased from around 85% in 1990 to 145% in 2017. Gender disparity in education enrollment has also reduced significantly over the years, with almost equal participation of girls and boys in primary education, which was not the case previously.</p>
    <p>Another significant area that has shown improvement in Bangladesh is healthcare. Life expectancy has increased from 59 years in 1990 to 73 years in 2019. The infant mortality rate has dropped from 87 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 24 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2019. Similarly, maternal mortality has also reduced from 569 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 173 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2019. These statistics show that Bangladesh has made commendable progress in healthcare and has been successful in creating a healthier population.</p>
    <p>Bangladesh's economic development cannot be overlooked either. It has achieved a steady GDP growth rate of 6% in the past decade, which has been possible due to the significant investment in agriculture, garment, and textile exports, remittances, microfinance, and manufacturing industries.</p>

   <section id="case-studies">
    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>One of the remarkable cases of human development in Bangladesh is its success in the garment industry. The country is now the world's second-largest exporter of ready-made garments, after China. The garment industry provides employment to millions of women who were previously excluded from the male-dominated workforce. It has empowered women by giving them economic independence and has contributed significantly to the country's overall economic growth.</p>
    <p>Another inspiring example of human development in Bangladesh is its success in microfinance. Organizations such as Grameen Bank and BRAC have offered loans and financial services to the poorest of the poor in remote areas of the country. This has brought about a significant change in their standard of living, with families being able to access healthcare, education, and better nutrition. These services have also led to women empowerment, with women being able to start their businesses.</p>
    <p>Finally, Bangladesh's success in reducing gender disparity in education enrollment cannot be underestimated. Bangladesh has prioritized education for girls and women in rural areas by investing in schools, implementing targeted scholarships, and creating female teachers' posts. This has increased access to education for girls and women and has improved their skills and employability.</p>

   <section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>1. Bangladesh's unrestricted efforts towards human development have led it ahead on the parameters of HDI compared to most countries, including India. The country's significant achievements in education, health, and economic development are praiseworthy.</p>
    <p>2. Bangladesh is an excellent example of how a developing country can prioritize human development and achieve remarkable progress in a relatively short period.</p>
    <p>3. If Bangladesh can continue its efforts towards human development with consistent investment and innovative policies, it is set to achieve even higher rankings in the HDI report in the future.</p>
