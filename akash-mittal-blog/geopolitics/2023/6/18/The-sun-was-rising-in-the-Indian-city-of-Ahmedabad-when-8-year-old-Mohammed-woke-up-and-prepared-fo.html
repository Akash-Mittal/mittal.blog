  <h1>The sun was rising in the Indian city of Ahmedabad when 8-year-old Mohammed woke up and prepared for school. He washed his face, brushed his teeth and put on his uniform. Before he left, his mother hugged him tightly and reminded him to study hard and excel, just like his older brother.</h1></br> <img src="images/The-sun-was-rising-in-the-Indian-city-of-Ahmedabad-when-8-year-old-Mohammed-woke-up-and-prepared-fo.jpeg" alt="+The-sun-was-rising-in-the-Indian-city-of-Ahmedabad-when-8-year-old-Mohammed-woke-up-and-prepared-fo+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.asiaone.com/world/protests-planned-modis-us-visit-over-indias-human-rights" target="_blank" href="https://www.asiaone.com/world/protests-planned-modis-us-visit-over-indias-human-rights" rel="noopener">https://www.asiaone.com/world/protests-planned-modis-us-visit-over-indias-human-rights</a></span></h5>

  <p>But Mohammed would never make it to school that day, or any other day. As he walked outside, he was confronted by a group of men who accused him of stealing money from a nearby shop. They tied him up, beat him mercilessly and left him on the side of the road. His mother found him lying unconscious and rushed him to the hospital, but it was too late. Mohammed had died from his injuries.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This tragic story is just one example of the human rights abuses that have plagued India for decades. Despite being the world's largest democracy and a growing economic power, India has failed to address issues such as caste discrimination, gender inequality, police brutality and religious intolerance.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>These issues have not gone unnoticed by the international community, and now, as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi prepares for a visit to the United States, protests are being planned to voice concerns over India's human rights record.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One of the main areas of concern is the treatment of India's Dalit community. Dalits, also known as "untouchables," are at the bottom of India's caste system and face discrimination in almost every aspect of their lives. Despite laws prohibiting discrimination, Dalits continue to be subjected to violence, forced labor and sexual exploitation.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In 2016, a group of Dalit men were beaten by members of a higher caste for skinning a dead cow. The incident sparked widespread protests and calls for justice, but little action has been taken to address the underlying issue of caste discrimination.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another area of concern is the lack of accountability for police officers who commit human rights abuses. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, Indian police often use excessive force, torture and extrajudicial killings to maintain order.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One case study involves the death of a man named Devender Kumar Bharti in 2016. Bharti was arrested for stealing a cell phone and was allegedly beaten to death by police officers while in custody. Despite evidence of police brutality, no officers have been held accountable for the death.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Religious intolerance is also a growing problem in India. The Hindu nationalist government led by Modi has been accused of promoting an agenda that favors Hindus over other religious minorities, such as Muslims and Christians.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In 2019, the Indian government revoked the autonomy of the Muslim-majority region of Kashmir, citing security concerns. The move has been criticized by human rights organizations for its impact on the human rights of the Kashmiri people.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>As Modi prepares to visit the United States, protests are being planned to draw attention to these and other issues. The protests are being organized by a coalition of Indian diaspora groups and human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, India's human rights record is a complex issue that requires sustained attention and action. Some steps that can be taken include enforcing existing laws against discrimination, promoting accountability for police officers who commit human rights abuses and creating an environment of religious tolerance and acceptance.</p>
