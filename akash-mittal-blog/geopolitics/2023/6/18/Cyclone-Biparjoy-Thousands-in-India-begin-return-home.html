    <p class="story">The residents of Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and West Bengal have been hit by the cyclone Biparjoy that has killed 17 people and left thousands stranded. But now, as the storm weakens and the flood water starts to recede, the residents of these states are beginning to return home.</p>
    <p>According to the National Disaster Management Authority, more than 5,000 people were evacuated to safer locations, including government shelters, during the storm. And now that the worst of the storm is over, the focus has shifted to relief and rehabilitation efforts.</p>
    <h2>Relief efforts</h2>
    <p>The Indian government has deployed teams of the National Disaster Response Force and the Indian Army to assist in relief operations. The teams are working around the clock to clear blocked roads, distribute food and water, and restore power and communication lines.</p>
    <p>Several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have also joined hands with the government to provide relief. These organizations are providing medical aid, distributing essential goods and setting up temporary shelters for the affected people.</p>
