    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>For cricket fans across the world, India vs Pakistan matches are legendary. Every time these two teams face each other on the field, it is not just about cricket â€“ it is a battle between two nations. The excitement, the tension, and the drama that ensue make for an unforgettable experience. But what happens if there is an ICC event without this matchup? Can the event still be as exciting and appealing to the fans? The former Indian opener, Gautam Gambhir, has raised this question just as the World Test Championship (WTC) 3 begins.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>India and Pakistan have had many memorable encounters in the past, in various formats of cricket. One such instance was the final of the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy. The two teams met in the final, and it turned out to be a one-sided affair, with Pakistan emerging victorious. However, the match was still watched by millions of fans, turning it into one of the most-watched cricket matches of all time.</p>
    <p>Another example was the India vs Pakistan encounter in the 2011 ICC World Cup. This was the first time the two teams were facing each other in a World Cup match since 2003. The match was highly anticipated, and it did not disappoint. India won by 29 runs, but it was the atmosphere at the stadium that left a lasting impression on everyone who witnessed it.</p>

    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>Let us take the example of the 2021 ICC T20 World Cup. India was set to host the event, and fans were eagerly awaiting the India vs Pakistan matchup. However, due to political tensions between the two countries, the match was moved to Dubai. Although the match took place, it did not have the same charm and appeal that it would have had if it had been played in India. Despite being a closely contested match, with Pakistan winning by 10 runs, it failed to generate the same level of excitement as it would have if it had been played in India.</p>
    <p>Another case study is the 2018 Asia Cup. Once again, India and Pakistan met in the Super Four stage of the tournament. Although India won the match by 9 wickets, it was billed as one of the most important matches of the tournament. The match was watched by millions of fans across the world, and the interest in the tournament peaked during this matchup.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>It is safe to say that an ICC event without India vs Pakistan is not as exciting for the fans. The history and rivalry between the two teams make every encounter a spectacle. The adrenaline rush that fans experience when the two teams face each other cannot be replicated. The excitement, drama, and tension that an India vs Pakistan match generates are incomparable. Hence, it is safe to say that an ICC event without India vs Pakistan is incomplete.</p>
