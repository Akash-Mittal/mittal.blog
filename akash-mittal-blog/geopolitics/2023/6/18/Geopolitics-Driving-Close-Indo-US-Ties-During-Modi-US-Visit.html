    <h2>Interesting Story</h2>
    <p>When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi embarked on his visit to the United States in 2014, it was touted as a historic trip to strengthen economic ties between the two nations. However, as the visit progressed, it became clear that there was more on the agenda than just business deals. The visit was a reflection of the geopolitics at play, with India and the US forging a closer alliance amid rising tensions between China and the US.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>The Indo-US relationship is not a new one, but it has seen significant growth in recent years, with both nations identifying common interests and goals. One such example is the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or the Quad, which comprises India, the US, Japan, and Australia and is seen as a counter to China's growing military and economic influence in the region.</p>
    <p>Another example is the US support for India's bid for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. The US has recognized India as a rising global power and sees its partnership with India as a crucial element in maintaining peace and stability in the region.</p>
    <p>Economic ties have also played a major role in the growing Indo-US relationship. The US is India's second-largest trading partner and the two nations have established various trade agreements to promote greater cooperation.</p>
