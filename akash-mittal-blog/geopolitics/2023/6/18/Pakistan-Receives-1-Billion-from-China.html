   <h2>Examples of Chinese Investment in Pakistan</h2>
   <p>China has been investing in Pakistan for a long time, and this billion-dollar investment is just one of many examples of their strong relationship. China has invested in many sectors, including infrastructure, energy, telecommunications, and agriculture. Here are a few examples:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The Karakoram Highway, which connects Pakistan to China's Xinjiang province, was built with Chinese investment.</li>
    <li>The Gwadar Port, a deep-sea port in Balochistan, is another example of Chinese investment in Pakistan.</li>
    <li>The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a $62 billion project that aims to connect Gwadar Port to China's northwestern region. This project includes the construction of highways, railways, and energy pipelines.</li>
    <li>Chinese companies have invested in Pakistan's agriculture sector to improve crop yields and reduce poverty.</li>
   </ul>

   <h3>1. K-Electric</h3>
   <p>K-Electric, the sole power distributor in Karachi, was acquired by the Chinese company Shanghai Electric in 2017. Since the acquisition, K-Electric has invested in infrastructure and improved their power distribution network. This has resulted in a significant reduction in power outages and an increase in the supply of electricity to households and businesses.</p>
