    <p>It was a bright sunny day in Beijing and Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in the city to meet with top Chinese officials to discuss the strained relationship between the two countries, when news broke of a spy balloon incident that left the Chinese government red-faced.</p>
    <p>The incident involved a US military balloon that had reportedly drifted into Chinese airspace, causing alarm among the Chinese authorities who saw it as a violation of their sovereignty. The incident was immediately condemned by the Chinese government, which demanded an explanation from the US.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, President Joe Biden described the incident as "embarrassing" for China, particularly at a time when the two sides were seeking to mend ties.</p>

    <h2>Recent Indo-China relations</h2>
    <p>The spy balloon incident is just the latest in a series of events that have strained the relationship between India and China in recent times. The two sides have been locked in a bitter border dispute since May 2020, when Chinese troops allegedly crossed into Indian territory and set up camps.</p>
    <p>The situation has escalated since then, with both sides deploying troops and weapons along the border. In June 2020, a violent clash between Indian and Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley left 20 Indian soldiers dead, and an unknown number of Chinese casualties.</p>
    <p>The two sides have engaged in several rounds of talks to resolve the dispute, but progress has been slow. In February 2021, they agreed to a partial disengagement of troops from the Pangong Lake area, but the situation remains tense along the rest of the border.</p>

    <h3>Galwan Valley clash</h3>
    <p>The Galwan Valley clash was a major flashpoint in the border dispute between India and China. On June 15, 2020, Indian and Chinese troops engaged in a violent clash in the valley, which left 20 Indian soldiers dead and an unknown number of Chinese casualties. The incident was the first time in over four decades that casualties were reported along the India-China border.</p>
    <h3>Pangong Lake disengagement</h3>
    <p>In February 2021, India and China agreed to a partial disengagement of troops from the Pangong Lake area in Ladakh, where they had been locked in a standoff for several months. Under the agreement, Indian and Chinese troops would move back from their positions and create a buffer zone between them. The agreement was seen as a positive step towards resolving the border dispute.</p>
