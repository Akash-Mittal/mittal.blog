   <p>Let me tell you a story.</p>
   <p>Once upon a time, there was a young boy who loved playing cricket. He dreamed of representing his country on the biggest stage and winning the World Cup. He admired the likes of Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, and Rahul Dravid, who were his idols.</p>
   <p>Years passed, and the boy grew up to become a professional cricketer himself. He played for his state team, scored lots of runs, and caught the attention of the national selectors. Finally, he got his big break and was included in the Indian cricket team for a major tournament.</p>
   <p>But there was one problem. The team had a new head coach who was not as well-known as the boy's former idols. His name was Rahul Dravid.</p>
   <p>The boy was disappointed. He had always looked up to Dravid as a batsman, but he wasn't sure if Dravid had what it takes to be a good coach. He had heard some negative comments about Dravid's coaching abilities and was skeptical about his appointment.</p>
   <p>As the tournament progressed, the boy noticed something strange. The team seemed to be playing better than ever before. They were more disciplined, more focused, and more confident. They were winning matches and creating new records.</p>
   <p>The boy was surprised. He had never seen the Indian team perform so well. He wondered if it was just a fluke or if Dravid's coaching was making a difference.</p>
   <p>But then he remembered something else. Dravid had always been known for his hard work, his dedication, and his attention to detail. He had spent countless hours preparing for each match, studying the opposition, and analyzing his own team's strengths and weaknesses. He had always put his team first and had never let his personal ego come in the way.</p>
   <p>The boy realized that these were exactly the qualities that were making a difference to the Indian team under Dravid's coaching. He realized that Dravid may not be as famous or glamorous as some of his former teammates, but he was definitely making a positive impact on the team and on Indian cricket.</p>
   <p>This story may be fictional, but it's not too far from the truth. Rahul Dravid, the former Indian cricket captain and one of the country's greatest batsmen, is currently serving as the head coach of the Indian cricket team. He took over the role in July 2021, after the departure of Ravi Shastri, and has since led the team to some impressive victories.</p>
   <h2>Basit Ali's Criticism of Dravid</h2>
   <p>However, not everyone is convinced of Dravid's coaching abilities. In a recent interview with PakPassion.net, ex-Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali criticized Dravid's coaching methods and called him a "zero" as a coach.</p>
   <p>"As a coach, he is absolutely zero," Ali said. "I had mentioned this when Rahul Dravid was appointed as the coach of India...the thinking of Dravid is much different from that of a modern-day coach. He believes in old-school methods.</p>
   <p>"He will not recognize the new problems that are emerging in cricket, so Indian cricket is going to face a lot of problems, especially in white-ball cricket," he added.</p>
   <h2>Is Dravid Really a "Zero" as a Coach?</h2>
   <p>Ali's comments have sparked a debate among cricket fans and experts. Some have criticized him for being biased against India, while others have defended Dravid and praised his coaching abilities.</p>
   <p>So, who is right? Is Dravid really a "zero" as a coach, or is he being unfairly criticized?</p>
   <h3>Examples of Dravid's Coaching Success</h3>
   <p>One way to answer this question is to look at some concrete examples of Dravid's coaching success. Since taking over as the head coach of the Indian cricket team, Dravid has led the team to some impressive victories and performances.</p>
   <p>For example, in August 2021, India beat England 3-1 in a five-match Test series, with Dravid as the head coach. This was India's third Test series win in England and their first under Dravid's coaching. The Indian team showed great resilience, skill, and determination throughout the series, and Dravid was widely praised for his role in their success.</p>
   <p>In September 2021, India won the fourth Test against England by 157 runs, thanks to some great batting performances by Rohit Sharma and Cheteshwar Pujara. The win helped India take a 2-1 lead in the series, and Dravid was once again credited with his contribution to the team's performance.</p>
   <p>Dravid has also been praised for his work with the Indian batsmen, who have shown significant improvement under his coaching. Players like Shubman Gill, Rishabh Pant, and Ravindra Jadeja have all credited Dravid for their success, and he has been praised for his attention to detail, communication skills, and tactical acumen.</p>
   <h3>Case Studies of Dravid's Coaching Methods</h3>
   <p>Another way to evaluate Dravid's coaching abilities is to look at some case studies of his coaching methods. This can help us understand the specific tools and techniques that Dravid uses to improve his players' skills and performance.</p>
   <p>One example of this is Dravid's work with Shubman Gill, a young Indian opener who made his Test debut under Dravid's coaching. Dravid worked closely with Gill on his footwork, his technique, and his mental preparation, and helped him develop a more consistent and effective batting style. Gill went on to score a half-century in his debut Test and has since established himself as a vital member of the Indian team.</p>
   <p>Another example is Dravid's work with Rishabh Pant, the Indian wicket-keeper batsman who has been in scintillating form in recent months. Dravid has worked with Pant on his shot selection, his focus, and his fitness, and has helped him become more disciplined and consistent in his performances. Pant has credited Dravid for his success and has praised him for his ability to communicate effectively with players.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion: Dravid's Coaching Qualities</h2>
   <p>So, what can we conclude from all of this? Is Dravid really a "zero" as a coach, or is he a valuable asset to the Indian cricket team?</p>
   <p>Based on the evidence presented in this article, it's clear that Dravid has many qualities that make him an effective coach. These qualities include:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>His hard work and dedication to the game.</li>
    <li>His attention to detail and tactical acumen.</li>
    <li>His ability to communicate effectively with players.</li>
   </ol>
   <p>While it's true that Dravid may not have the same level of experience or reputation as some other coaches, he has certainly made a positive impact on the Indian cricket team and has helped them improve their performances in all formats of the game.</p>
