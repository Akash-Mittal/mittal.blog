   <p>India has sent a letter to the G20 on African Union membership after backing from the US, France, and China. This move is seen as an important step towards global economic unity and diversity.</p><img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2018/10/04/11/34/india-3729069_960_720.jpg" alt="India">
   <p>The G20 is a group of 19 countries and the European Union, representing around 80% of global GDP. It is a forum for international economic cooperation and decision-making on global economic issues. The African Union is a continental union consisting of 55 member states located on the African continent. Its main goal is to promote economic, social, and political unity among African states.</p>
   <p>This development is significant for several reasons. Firstly, it shows the commitment of major global players to inclusivity and diversity. It is important to have a representation of all major regions in forums like the G20 to ensure that every country has a say in global economic decisions.</p>
   <p>Secondly, this move will encourage the strengthening of economic ties between Africa and the rest of the world. Africa has a lot of untapped potential which needs to be harnessed for the benefit of the global economy. This membership in the G20 will give African countries a platform to showcase their strengths and opportunities.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, this initiative will help address some of the challenges faced by African countries such as weak infrastructure, low investment, and high debt. The G20 has the potential to provide financial and technical assistance to African countries, which would help spur economic growth and development.</p>
   <h2>Case studies</h2>
   <p>One of the best examples of how joining the G20 can benefit countries is South Korea. After joining the G20 in 1999, South Korea has become an economic powerhouse and a leader in modern technologies and innovation. Its membership in the G20 provided South Korea with an opportunity to showcase its strengths and learn from other countries.</p>
   <p>Another example is Saudi Arabia, which joined the G20 in 1999. The country has made significant progress in diversifying its economy and reducing dependence on oil. Its membership in the G20 has given it access to global markets and capital.</p>
