  <p>Belarus is a country that has been in the news recently due to the ongoing protests against President Alexander Lukashenko's regime. While the situation in Belarus is complex, it highlights an important lesson for policymakers around the world - pursuing geo-strategic interests may be more productive than direct democracy promotion.</p>
  <h2>The Story of Belarus and Direct Democracy Promotion</h2>
  <p>Belarus has long been considered one of the last authoritarian regimes in Europe, with President Lukashenko holding power for over 25 years. In response to the country's repressive policies, many policymakers and organizations around the world have called for greater democracy promotion in Belarus.</p>
  <p>In recent years, there have been numerous attempts to promote democracy in Belarus through direct means, such as funding opposition groups and providing training and resources to civil society organizations. While these efforts have had some success, they have not been enough to bring about significant change in the country's political system.</p>
  <p>However, the recent protests in Belarus have highlighted the importance of pursuing geo-strategic interests over direct democracy promotion in countries like Belarus.</p>
  <h2>Examples and Case Studies</h2>
  <p>One example of pursuing geo-strategic interests over direct democracy promotion can be seen in the United States' relationship with Saudi Arabia. Despite Saudi Arabia's poor human rights record and lack of political freedom, the United States has maintained a close relationship with the country due to its geo-strategic importance in the Middle East.</p>
  <p>Another example is China's relationship with various African countries. While China's approach to democracy promotion is controversial, its geo-strategic interests in securing access to natural resources and markets have led it to invest heavily in African countries, often without regard for democratic norms or human rights.</p>
  <p>These examples illustrate the importance of considering geo-strategic interests when formulating foreign policy, rather than simply focusing on democracy promotion.</p>
