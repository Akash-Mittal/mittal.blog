    <p>It was a hot summer day in Manipur, a northeastern state of India, when a young girl named Aasha woke up early to help her mother with household chores. As she was sweeping the front porch, she heard loud noises coming from the street. She peeked outside and saw a group of men in military uniforms dragging a woman by her hair.</p>
    <p>Aasha was scared and confused, but she quickly realized that this was not an uncommon sight in her hometown. Since the 1950s, Manipur has been plagued by violent conflicts between the Indian government and various insurgent groups. The military has been accused of human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings, torture, and rape.</p>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>According to a report by Human Rights Watch, between 2008 and 2012, at least 85 people were killed by security forces in Manipur in alleged extrajudicial executions. In 2016, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed concern about the continuing human rights violations in the state.</p>
    <p>In recent years, there have been several incidents of violence in Manipur that have made the headlines. In 2015, nine people were killed and dozens injured in a bomb blast in the city of Imphal. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) later blamed a Manipuri separatist group for the attack. In 2018, two journalists were arrested for writing an article criticizing the government's handling of the state's drug problem.</p>
    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>One of the most high-profile cases of alleged extrajudicial killing in Manipur is that of Thangjam Manorama, a 32-year-old woman who was arrested by the Assam Rifles in 2004 and later found dead with multiple gunshot wounds to her genitals and other parts of her body. The military claimed that she was an insurgent and that she was killed while trying to escape. However, an autopsy revealed that she was raped and tortured before being killed.</p>
    <p>Another case is that of Irom Sharmila, a human rights activist who went on a hunger strike for 16 years to protest against the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, a law that gives the military sweeping powers in areas of conflict. Sharmila was force-fed through a nasal tube for the entire duration of her hunger strike, and was eventually released in 2016.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>1. The violence in Manipur deserves the attention of Prime Minister Modi and the Indian government. This conflict has been going on for too long, and it is time for a peaceful resolution.</p>
    <p>2. The human rights violations in Manipur must be addressed and those responsible held accountable. The military should not be above the law, and justice must be served for the victims and their families.</p>
    <p>3. The voices of the people of Manipur, especially those who have been affected by the violence and the conflict, should be heard and included in any effort to bring peace to the state. Only by listening to the grievances and aspirations of all sides can a lasting solution be found.</p>
