   <p>On September 25, 2018, Chinese President Xi Jinping met with Bill Gates, Co-chair of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation of the United States, in Beijing to exchange views on global health and other issues of mutual concern. The meeting came at a time when China-U.S. relations were under strain due to ongoing trade disputes, but the two leaders focused on their shared commitment to addressing global health challenges through philanthropy and cooperation.</p>
   <h2>Tackling Global Health Challenges</h2>
   <p>Xi Jinping and Bill Gates discussed the importance of investing in global health to improve the well-being of all people. They recognized that many of the world's most pressing health challenges, such as infectious diseases and maternal and child health, require international cooperation and coordinated efforts.</p>
   <p>One example of the Gates Foundation's global health initiatives is the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), which provides access to life-saving vaccines for children in the world's poorest countries. Since 2000, GAVI has helped vaccinate more than 760 million children and prevent an estimated 13 million deaths. The Gates Foundation has contributed more than $4 billion to GAVI, making it one of the foundation's largest global health investments.</p>
   <h2>Philanthropy in China</h2>
   <p>During the meeting, Xi Jinping and Bill Gates also discussed the role of philanthropy in promoting social welfare in China. The Gates Foundation has been working in China since 2007, partnering with the government and local organizations to improve healthcare, education, and agricultural development.</p>
   <p>One example of the Gates Foundation's work in China is the China-UK Global Health Support Programme, which aims to improve health outcomes and establish sustainable health systems in China. The programme has supported initiatives such as maternal and child health services, tuberculosis control, and health policy research, benefiting millions of people in China.</p>
   <h2>Collaboration in the Face of Covid-19</h2>
   <p>The Covid-19 pandemic has underscored the need for international cooperation in addressing global health challenges. Xi Jinping and Bill Gates's meeting in 2018 laid the foundation for collaboration between China and the United States in responding to the pandemic.</p>
   <p>The Gates Foundation has played a key role in the global response to Covid-19, providing funding for vaccine development and distribution, supporting research and development of treatments, and advocating for equitable access to healthcare. In May 2020, the Gates Foundation announced a commitment of $300 million to support the global Covid-19 response.</p>
