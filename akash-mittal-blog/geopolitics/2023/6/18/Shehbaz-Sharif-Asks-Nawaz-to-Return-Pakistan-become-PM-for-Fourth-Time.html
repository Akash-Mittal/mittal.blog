  <section>
   <p>In a surprising turn of events, Shehbaz Sharif, the Leader of Opposition in the National Assembly of Pakistan, has requested his brother Nawaz Sharif to return to Pakistan and become the Prime Minister for a record-breaking fourth time. This request comes after Nawaz was removed from the office in 2017 due to corruption charges.</p>
   <p>Shehbaz believes that Nawaz is the best candidate to lead the country out of the current political and economic crisis. He also thinks that the people of Pakistan trust Nawaz and would welcome him with open arms.</p>
   <p>However, this request has not been well-received by the ruling party of Pakistan, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). They have accused Shehbaz of trying to sabotage the current government and have called for his resignation.</p>
  </section>
  <h2>Why should Nawaz return?</h2>
  <section>
   <div class="case-study"><img src="https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2019/01/22/782832-nawaz-sharif.jpg">
    <p>Nawaz has a proven track record of leading Pakistan out of difficult situations. During his previous terms as PM, he was able to successfully handle the 1998 nuclear tests, the Kargil War, and the 2010 floods.</p>
   </div>

    <p>The current government has been unable to handle the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis. The people of Pakistan are suffering due to their incompetence. Nawaz has experience in handling crisis situations and can provide the necessary leadership and guidance to the people.</p>
   </div>

    <p>Nawaz's previous terms as PM were marked by economic growth and stability. During his tenure, he was able to reduce poverty, increase employment opportunities, and improve the country's infrastructure. Pakistan needs a leader who has experience and knowledge in managing the economy.</p>
   </div>
  </section>
  <h2>Has PTI done enough?</h2>
  <section>
   <p>Since coming into power in 2018, PTI has not been able to fulfil their promises of making Pakistan a corruption-free, prosperous, and safer nation. Their governance has been marred by political instability, economic turmoil, and social unrest. Here are some examples:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/22/pakistan-opposition-calls-for-pm-khans-resignation-over-rally-ban" target="_blank">The recent ban on opposition rallies</a> has caused an uproar among the opposition parties and has been labelled as a curtailment of democracy.</li>
    <li><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/international/pakistan/govt-accepts-defeat-protests-start-for-federal-enclave/articleshow/80125267.cms" target="_blank">The government's inability to control the sugar and flour crisis</a> has caused a huge public outcry, with people taking to the streets to protest against their inefficiency.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.voanews.com/south-central-asia/scores-die-pakistan-worst-train-crash-years" target="_blank">The recent train accident</a> that claimed the lives of 63 people has been blamed on the government's negligence in maintaining the rail network.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>These examples are just the tip of the iceberg. The PTI government has failed to deliver on its promises, and the people of Pakistan have been left disillusioned.</p>
  </section>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <section>
   <p>Shehbaz Sharif's request to Nawaz Sharif to return to Pakistan and become the PM for a fourth time has caused quite a stir in the country's political arena. While PTI has criticised this move, many others believe that Nawaz is the best candidate to lead Pakistan out of its current crisis.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, here are three points to consider:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Nawaz has a proven track record of successfully leading Pakistan out of difficult situations.</li>
    <li>The current PTI government has failed to deliver on its promises and has left the people disillusioned.</li>
    <li>Pakistan needs a leader who can provide the necessary leadership and guidance to the people during these tough times.</li>
   </ol>
