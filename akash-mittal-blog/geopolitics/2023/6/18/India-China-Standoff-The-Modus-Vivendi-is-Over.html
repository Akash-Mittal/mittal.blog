    <p>It was a normal day for the residents of the Galwan Valley in Ladakh. The region is disputed territory between India and China, but the situation had remained relatively calm for the past few months. Indian and Chinese soldiers participated in disengagement talks, with both sides agreeing to maintain the status quo.</p>
    <p>However, on June 15, 2020 - everything changed. The Indian soldiers were brutally attacked by the Chinese side, leaving 20 soldiers dead. This incident marked a turning point in Indo-China relations, effectively ending the "modus vivendi" or understanding between the two countries.</p>
    <h2>Beijing Has Spared None</h2>
    <p>The attack on Indian soldiers was just the tip of the iceberg. In the aftermath of the incident, journalists were also targeted by the Chinese authorities. Indian journalists working in China were harassed, their visas were not renewed, and they were forced to leave the country. Chinese journalists in India faced similar issues, with some being expelled from the country.</p>
    <h2>The Economic Front</h2>
    <p>The conflict between India and China is not just limited to the border dispute. The economic front has also been severely impacted. India has banned over 200 Chinese apps, including popular apps like TikTok, WeChat and PUBG. These bans have dealt a severe blow to the Chinese economy, with estimated losses of over $2 billion.</p>
    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>One of the biggest beneficiaries of the economic fallout of the India-China standoff has been Taiwan. The island nation has seen a surge in business investments, with several companies shifting their manufacturing base from China to Taiwan. In fact, the Taiwanese government has actively encouraged this trend, offering incentives to companies to set up their operations in the country.</p>
    <p>Another interesting development has been the increased cooperation between the US and India. The two countries have signed several agreements, including the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement for Geo-Spatial Cooperation (BECA) and the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA). These agreements will enable the two countries to exchange intelligence and share military technology.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion in Three Points</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>The Galwan Valley incident marked the end of the "modus vivendi" or understanding between India and China.</li>
     <li>The conflict has impacted both the border dispute as well as the economic front, with India banning over 200 Chinese apps and Chinese journalists in India being harassed.</li>
     <li>The fallout from the standoff has led to increased cooperation between India and the US, as well as a surge in investments in Taiwan.</li>
