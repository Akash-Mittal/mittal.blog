  <p>The arch-rivals India and Pakistan have always been at each other's throats when it comes to cricket. From the infamous 2003 World Cup match where a certain Sachin Tendulkar destroyed the Pakistani bowling attack to the nail-biting finish of the 2019 World Cup encounter, these two teams have always been the center of attention. The excitement of this fierce rivalry is set to continue in the 2023 World Cup as well, as the ICC gears up to release the schedule.</p><!-- Examples -->
