  <title>Once upon a time in the world of cricket, there was a coach who was called "absolutely zero" by one of his esteemed opponents. The coach in question was none other than Rahul Dravid, the former Indian cricketing legend who is currently serving as the head coach of the Indian national team. The critic in question was ex-Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali, who recently ripped apart the Indian coach after India's loss to New Zealand in the inaugural World Test Championship final. </title>

  <p></p>
  <p>As a coach, Rahul Dravid has always been held in high regard by cricketing experts and fans alike. He is known for his ability to nurture young talent and provide them with a solid foundation to build their cricketing careers upon. His leadership style is often lauded for its calm and composed approach, and his team is known to perform well under pressure. However, the recent loss to New Zealand seems to have brought Dravid's coaching abilities into question, at least according to Basit Ali.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>According to Ali, India lost the match the moment they opted to field first after worrying about the overcast conditions. He said that Dravid's decision to field first was a tactical error that cost India dearly in the end. Ali's criticism of Dravid is not unfounded, as the Indian team's bowlers were ineffective in the first innings, allowing New Zealand to score an imposing total of 249 runs. India managed to score only 217 runs in their first innings, and this put them on the back foot going into the second innings.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Despite India's valiant efforts in the second innings, they were unable to overcome the deficit and lost the match to New Zealand. Ali's criticism of Dravid may be harsh, but it does highlight the importance of a coach's decision-making abilities in a cricket match. A coach's job is not just to provide technical and tactical guidance to the players, but also to make crucial decisions that can make or break a match.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One of the best examples of a coach's role in decision-making can be seen in the case of the Australian cricket team's victory in the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup. The team was coached by Darren Lehmann, who made the crucial decision to drop out-of-form players and bring in new blood into the team. This decision paid off handsomely in the end, as Australia won the World Cup convincingly, with several new players making significant contributions to the team's success.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another example of a coach's role in decision-making can be seen in the case of the Indian cricket team's victory in the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup. The team was coached by Gary Kirsten, who focused on building a strong team culture and improving the team's fitness levels. Kirsten's decision to give the players more freedom and responsibility also paid off, as the Indian team was able to handle pressure situations well and emerge victorious in the World Cup.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, a coach's decision-making abilities can make all the difference in a cricket match. While Rahul Dravid's decision to field first may have cost India the match against New Zealand, it is important to remember that coaches are human too, and they can make mistakes. It is also important to note that one match does not define a coach's abilities, and Dravid's overall record as a coach is still impressive. As long as coaches learn from their mistakes and make the right decisions more often than not, they can lead their teams to victory.</p>
