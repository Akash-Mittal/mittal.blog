    <h2>The Devastating Impact of Pakistan's Floods</h2>
    <p>In 2020, Pakistan experienced one of the worst floods in its history. Heavy rainfall caused rivers to overflow and inundated large parts of the country. The floods left a trail of destruction, damaging homes, infrastructure, and crops. Millions of people were displaced and forced to seek shelter in makeshift camps.</p>
    <p>The aftermath of the floods has created a mobility crisis that is still ongoing. The displaced people are struggling to migrate or relocate to safer areas. Many are living in dire conditions, without access to basic services like clean water, sanitation, and healthcare.</p>

    <h2>Examples of the Mobility Crisis</h2>
    <article>
     <h3>Ali's Story</h3>
     <p>Ali is a 35-year-old farmer who lived in the Sindh province of Pakistan. When the floods hit his village, his house and land were inundated. He lost all his crops and livestock, and his family's belongings were washed away. They had to flee to a nearby town and seek refuge in a school that had been turned into a camp.</p>
     <p>Months went by, and the family received little support from the authorities. Their living conditions were unbearable, with overcrowded tents and no privacy. Ali's children couldn't attend school, and his wife fell ill due to unsanitary conditions. Ali wanted to move to another province where he had relatives who could help him start over, but he had no means to get there.</p>
     <p>Ali's story is typical of many flood victims in Pakistan. They are trapped in camps, unable to return home or move to a safer place.</p>
