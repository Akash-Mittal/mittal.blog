   <h3>An insider's look into a complex relationship</h3>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>China has asked the last Indian reporter in Beijing to leave, resulting in a complete shutdown of any Indian news sources within the country. This recent development only highlights the ongoing tensions between the two nations, which has been characterized by geopolitical tensions.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Geopolitical Tensions</h2>
   <p>The complex nature of the China-India relationship can be seen in a number of instances:</p>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>The Border Dispute:</strong> One of the key sources of tension between the two countries is the disputed border. The two countries share a 4,056 km long border, and it has been the site of numerous conflicts over the years. The most recent of these clashes occurred in June of 2020, when a skirmish in the Galwan Valley resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers.</li>
    <li><strong>The Dalai Lama:</strong> Another source of tension between the two countries is India's support of the Dalai Lama. Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, was granted asylum in India in 1959. Since then, India has been a safe haven for Tibetan exiles and a proponent of the Tibetan cause. China, on the other hand, views the Dalai Lama as a separatist and has repeatedly expressed their displeasure with India's support of him.</li>
    <li><strong>BRI / CPEC:</strong> One of the most contentious issues between the two nations is China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), of which the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a key component. India has repeatedly voiced their opposition to the BRI, citing concerns over sovereignty and debt trap diplomacy.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <p>One case study that exemplifies the complicated nature of the China-India relationship is their interactions with Nepal.</p>
   <p>Nepal is a small land-locked country that shares borders with India and China. While historically India has maintained close ties with Nepal, China has been making inroads into the country in recent years. In 2015, Nepal was hit by a devastating earthquake that killed over 9,000 people and left many more displaced. China was quick to offer aid and support, while India was criticized for their slow response. This event served as a turning point in the Nepal-India relationship, which has since been strained. In 2019, Nepal signed a landmark agreement with China to build a railway linking Tibet with Kathmandu, which was viewed as a major blow to India's influence in the region.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The China-India relationship is complex and multi-faceted, with a long history of geopolitical tensions. While there have been efforts to improve relations between the two nations, the recent expulsion of Indian journalists from Beijing only serves to highlight the ongoing issues. It is difficult to predict the future of this relationship, but it is clear that it will continue to be a source of global interest.</p>
