  <p></p>
  <p>The company's founders realized that they needed to bring their supply chains closer to home in order to ensure a steady flow of materials and maintain quality control. They began working with suppliers in Mexico and Canada, leveraging the benefits of the USMCA trade agreement to find mutually beneficial solutions.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>As a result, the company was able to increase production capacity, reduce costs, and create jobs in the Americas. This story highlights the importance of bringing supply chains back to the Americas, a topic that U.S. Senators Michael Bennet and Bill Cassidy discussed during a recent Atlantic Council conversation.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>According to Bennet and Cassidy, the Americas Act is a key piece of legislation that can help revitalize supply chains in the region. The Act, which was introduced in March of 2021, aims to strengthen economic ties between the United States and its neighbors to the north and south.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One of the main provisions of the Americas Act is the creation of a $15 billion fund to support infrastructure projects in the Americas. This investment can help modernize transportation networks, improve power grids, and expand broadband internet access, all of which are essential for a thriving economy.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another key component of the Americas Act is the establishment of a "Made in the Americas" labeling program. This program would allow businesses to promote products that are made in the United States, Canada, or Mexico, providing consumers with greater transparency about the origins of the goods they purchase.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Finally, the Americas Act includes measures to promote workforce development and training programs in the region. This can help ensure that businesses have access to a skilled workforce and that individuals have the skills necessary to succeed in the 21st-century economy.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, the Americas Act is an important piece of legislation that can help bring supply chains back to the Americas. By investing in infrastructure, promoting transparency and workforce development, and strengthening economic ties with our neighbors, we can create a more resilient, sustainable, and prosperous economy for all Americans.</p>
