  <p>The much-awaited ODI World Cup 2023 schedule has been announced by the ICC, and the tournament promises to be one of the most exciting cricketing events in recent history. The tournament will be hosted by India, with matches scheduled to be played across nine venues in the country.</p>
  <p>The Indian cricket team, led by Rohit Sharma, will be looking to win their third ODI World Cup title after triumphs in 1983 and 2011. However, as always, there will be tough competition from the other teams, including arch-rivals Pakistan.</p>
  <h2>Misbah Predicts an India vs Pakistan Final</h2>
  <p>One of the most interesting predictions for the tournament has come from former Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq who has predicted that the final of the ODI World Cup 2023 will be between India and Pakistan.</p>
  <p>Misbah's prediction is based on the current form and strength of the two teams, with both India and Pakistan having a talented pool of players who can perform in any conditions. Misbah also believes that the pressure of playing in front of a home crowd may affect some of the other teams, but India and Pakistan will be able to handle it better.</p>
  <h2>ODI World Cup 2023 Schedule and Fixtures</h2>
  <p>The ODI World Cup 2023 will kick off on 9th February 2023 with India playing the opening match. The tournament will conclude with the final on 26th March 2023.</p>
  <p>Here is the complete schedule and fixtures for the ODI World Cup 2023:</p>
