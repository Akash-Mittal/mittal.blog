   <p>In June 2019, Manchester witnessed a riveting match between two arch-rivals, India and Pakistan, during the ICC Cricket World Cup. The stadium was packed with tens of thousands of fans from both countries who had travelled from across the globe to witness this momentous clash.</p>
   <p>After a nail-biting encounter, India emerged victorious by 89 runs via the Duckworth-Lewis method. But what made this match unforgettable wasn't just the result; it was the intense emotions and passion exhibited by the players and fans alike.</p>
   <p>Will history repeat itself in 2023? The upcoming ICC meeting to decide the World Cup venues amid the BCCI vs PCB rift could determine if Chennai gets to host the much-anticipated India vs Pakistan match.</p>
   <h2>World Cup 2023 Schedule in the Next 48 Hours</h2>
   <p>The ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 is fast approaching, and the excitement and anticipation are palpable. The next 48 hours could shape up the schedule of the tournament, as the ICC meeting to decide the World Cup venues is scheduled to take place. Here is a quick glimpse of the expected World Cup 2023 Schedule:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The tournament is scheduled to start on February 9, 2023.</li>
    <li>The final will be played on March 26, 2023.</li>
    <li>The tournament will consist of ten teams.</li>
    <li>Each team will face each other once, and the top four teams will qualify for the semi-finals.</li>
    <li>The venues for the tournament are yet to be decided.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Chennai Likely to Host India vs Pakistan Match</h2>
   <p>One of the most anticipated matches of the World Cup 2023 is the clash between India and Pakistan. While the rivalry between the two nations is well-known, what adds to the excitement is the fact that these two teams have rarely faced each other in recent years due to political tensions and other issues. The last time these two teams played each other was during the 2019 World Cup.</p>
   <p>Based on recent reports, it is expected that Chennai will be chosen as the venue for the India vs Pakistan match. The city has a rich cricketing history, and the Chidambaram Stadium has hosted several high-profile matches in the past, including the 2011 World Cup final.</p>
   <p>Hosting the match in Chennai will not only be a huge boost for the city's tourism but also for the local cricketers and fans. It will also be a test of the city's preparedness to host big-ticket events given the ongoing pandemic and other logistical challenges.</p>
   <h2>ICC Meeting to Decide World Cup Venues Amid BCCI vs PCB Rift</h2>
   <p>The India-Pakistan cricketing rivalry is not just limited to the field. The two countries have a long-standing political conflict, which often spills over into cricket. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) have had their fair share of conflicts in the past, with the most recent being the cancellation of the Asia Cup, which was supposed to be held in September 2021.</p>
   <p>With the ICC meeting to decide the World Cup venues, the BCCI and PCB will certainly have a lot to discuss. The PCB has made it clear that it wants the India-Pakistan match to be held in Dubai, a neutral venue, citing security concerns. However, the BCCI has stated that it prefers to host the match in India.</p>
   <p>While there is no doubt that the India-Pakistan match is one of the most anticipated fixtures of the World Cup 2023, both boards need to find a solution that is acceptable to both parties. The ICC meeting could be a crucial turning point and could potentially bring an end to the ongoing conflict.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The India-Pakistan cricketing rivalry is one of the most intense and emotional rivalries in the world of sports. The two nations may have their political and social differences, but when it comes to cricket, it is a game that unites both countries.</p>
   <p>The upcoming ICC meeting to decide the World Cup venues amid the BCCI vs PCB rift could have a significant impact on the schedule of the tournament. While there is no doubt that the India-Pakistan match is a marquee fixture, both boards need to find a solution that is acceptable to both parties, keeping in mind the safety of the players and the fans.</p>
   <p>As fans, we can only hope that the two teams get to face each other on the field and that the match lives up to the expectations and excitement.</p>
