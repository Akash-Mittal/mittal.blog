    <p>In the fast-paced world of venture capital, timing is everything. This was evident in the recent split of Sequoia Capital, one of the world's most successful venture firms. In March 2021, Sequoia split into three entities, Sequoia Capital Global, Sequoia India, and Sequoia China, each with their own separate investment decisions and capital.</p>
    <p>The split was necessary due to the increasing complexity and diversity of the global market. Sequoia's India arm, in particular, has been expanding rapidly and is now one of the top venture capital firms in the region. With the split, Sequoia India is now free to pursue software deals in the United States, which was previously limited due to restrictions imposed by the parent company.</p>
    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>Sequoia's India arm has been actively investing in software startups in India and Southeast Asia for years. Their portfolio includes well-known names like OYO Rooms, Byju's, and Zomato. With the new freedom to invest in the U.S., Sequoia India is likely to expand its portfolio with U.S. startups as well.</p>
    <p>One example of the potential for Sequoia India's expansion into the U.S. market is their recent investment in Eruditus, a global edtech startup that is headquartered in the U.S. but has a substantial presence in India. Sequoia's $113 million investment in Eruditus shows their willingness to invest in global startups with an Indian connection. The investment will help Eruditus expand its reach further into the Indian market and beyond.</p>
    <p>Another case in point is the investment made by Sequoia India in Unacademy, an Indian edtech company that recently acquired the U.S.-based edtech startup, Coursavy. This acquisition, along with Sequoia India's investment, will help Unacademy establish a presence in the U.S. and expand its global reach.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>With the split of Sequoia Capital, the India arm is now free to pursue software deals in the U.S., which is home to some of the world's most innovative and disruptive startups. Sequoia's India arm has a proven track record of investing in successful software startups in India and Southeast Asia and is now poised to expand its portfolio with U.S. startups as well.</p>
    <p>The venture capital market is highly competitive and constantly evolving. Sequoia's split into three entities is a testament to the changing needs of the market and the need to adapt to new challenges. With their newfound freedom, Sequoia India is likely to emerge as a major player in the global venture capital space and continue to invest in innovative startups around the world.</p>
