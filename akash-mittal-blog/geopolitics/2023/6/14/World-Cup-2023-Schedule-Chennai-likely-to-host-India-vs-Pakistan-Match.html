  <p>The cricket world is abuzz with the news that Chennai is likely to host the much-awaited match between India and Pakistan in the 2023 World Cup. This has come in the wake of the ongoing rift between the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), which has led to a meeting of the International Cricket Council (ICC) to decide on the venues for the upcoming World Cup.</p>
  
  <p>The tension between India and Pakistan is not new. It has been festering for decades, and has spilled over into various areas, including sports. Cricket, being the most popular sport in both countries, has been at the forefront of this tension. Matches between India and Pakistan have always been watched with great anticipation, and have been the subject of much controversy and drama.</p>
  <p>One such instance was during the 2011 World Cup semi-final, which was held in Mohali, India. Pakistan and India were facing each other in a World Cup match after four years and there was huge hype around it. The Pakistani team, which had reached the semi-finals after defeating Australia, was being hailed as the underdogs, whereas the Indian team was considered to be a favorite. Right from the word go, the match was full of drama. The Pakistani team was on the back foot, but managed to stage a comeback. In the end, India won the match, but not before the Pakistani team gave them a scare.</p>
  <p>The match had a huge impact on both the countries. In India, the victory was celebrated with much fanfare, whereas in Pakistan, there was much disappointment. The match also showed how even a single match between India and Pakistan can galvanize the entire cricketing world.</p>
