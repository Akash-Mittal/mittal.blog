   <p>Natural disasters can be unpredictable and overwhelming. With each year, reports of damage caused by hurricanes, cyclones, earthquakes, and other natural calamities remind us how vulnerable we are to the forces of nature. Cyclone Biparjoy, which is currently approaching the border of India and Pakistan, is one such natural disaster that is causing concern among the people of both nations.</p>
   <p>The storm, which is equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane, is among the strongest ever recorded in the North Indian Ocean. As of now, it is expected to hit the coastal areas between the cities of Karachi and Porbandar.

    <li>Areas near rivers and water bodies that could be affected by flooding</li>
    <li>Areas with weak infrastructure, such as poorly constructed buildings and roads</li>
   </ul>
   <p>In addition to damage caused by wind and rain, Cyclone Biparjoy could lead to the displacement of thousands of people. The government authorities of both India and Pakistan are taking all necessary measures to ensure the safety of their citizens, including evacuation where necessary.</p>
