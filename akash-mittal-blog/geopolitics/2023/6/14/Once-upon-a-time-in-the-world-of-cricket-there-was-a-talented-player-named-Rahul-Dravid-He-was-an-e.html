  <h1>Once upon a time, in the world of cricket, there was a talented player named Rahul Dravid. He was an exceptional batsman and a successful captain who led India to victory on several occasions. However, recently, Dravid has been facing intense criticism from critics and former players. One such critic is ex-Pakistan player Basit Ali, who recently bashed Dravid, calling him "absolutely zero."</h1></br> <img src="images/Once-upon-a-time-in-the-world-of-cricket-there-was-a-talented-player-named-Rahul-Dravid-He-was-an-e.jpeg" alt="+Once-upon-a-time-in-the-world-of-cricket-there-was-a-talented-player-named-Rahul-Dravid-He-was-an-e+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.sportingnews.com/in/cricket/news/absolutely-zero-dravid-bashed-ex-pakistan-player-basit-ali/nja2ahornhojnjo01jhwvsic" target="_blank" href="https://www.sportingnews.com/in/cricket/news/absolutely-zero-dravid-bashed-ex-pakistan-player-basit-ali/nja2ahornhojnjo01jhwvsic" rel="noopener">https://www.sportingnews.com/in/cricket/news/absolutely-zero-dravid-bashed-ex-pakistan-player-basit-ali/nja2ahornhojnjo01jhwvsic</a></span></h5>
  <p></p>
  <p>Ali's comments come after India's recent test series loss to England. According to Ali, Dravid's coaching skills are below average, and he lacks the ability to produce new talent for the Indian team. Ali even went as far as to say that India would be better off without Dravid.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>But is Ali's criticism of Dravid fair? Let's take a closer look.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case Study 1: Under Dravid's coaching, India's under-19 team won the ICC World Cup in 2021. The team consisted of several talented young players, some of whom have already made their debut for the Indian senior team.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case Study 2: Dravid played a crucial role in nurturing players like Shubman Gill, Rishabh Pant, and Prithvi Shaw, who have become key players in India's current team.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case Study 3: Dravid's contribution to Indian cricket goes beyond coaching. He is known for his impeccable work ethics and discipline, which has inspired generations of cricketers in India.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>It is unfair to criticise Dravid based on one series loss. Dravid's coaching skills have been instrumental in producing new talent for the Indian cricket team, and his contribution to Indian cricket has been immense. He may have had a few setbacks, but his success as a player and a coach cannot be ignored.</p>
