  <p>Climate change is not just an environmental issue, but also a human rights issue. As temperatures rise and natural disasters become more frequent and severe, people around the world are being forced to flee their homes. In South Asia, millions of people are at risk of being displaced due to climate change, and India has an enormous responsibility to address this issue.</p>
  <h2>A Tale of Two Farmers</h2>
  <p>Picture two farmers in South Asia: one in Bangladesh and one in India. Both are struggling to make ends meet due to changing weather patterns and unpredictable rains. The Bangladeshi farmer lives in a coastal area prone to flooding, and his land has already been submerged several times in recent years. The Indian farmer lives in a drought-prone region, and has seen his crops fail year after year.</p>
  <p>Both farmers, it turns out, are climate refugees. They have been displaced from their homes due to the effects of climate change. But unlike refugees fleeing war or persecution, climate refugees receive no legal protection and no assistance from the international community. They are left to fend for themselves.</p>
  <h2>South Asia at Risk</h2>
  <p>The story of these two farmers is just a glimpse of the crisis facing South Asia. Many more people in the region are at risk of being displaced by rising sea levels, more frequent and severe cyclones, droughts, and floods. According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, climate-induced displacement in South Asia is estimated to be in the millions.</p>
  <p>India, in particular, is at the forefront of this crisis. The country is home to more than 1.3 billion people, many of whom live in areas vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, for instance, is one of the most densely populated areas in the world, and is at high risk of flooding due to sea level rise.</p>
  <h2>An Imperative to Act</h2>
  <p>Given the lack of international consensus, a unique opportunity exists for India to address the protection gap in South Asia's policy regime for climate migrants. Here are three reasons why India must take bold action:</p>
  <ol>
   <li><strong>Human Rights:</strong> Climate displacement is a human rights issue. The 1951 Refugee Convention does not recognize climate refugees, despite the fact that they are just as vulnerable and deserving of protection as refugees fleeing war or persecution. India, as a global leader on human rights issues, has a responsibility to step up and fill this gap.</li>
   <li><strong>Security:</strong> Displaced people are more vulnerable to violence, exploitation, and trafficking. This creates security risks not just for the displaced people themselves, but also for the countries and regions they flee to. By addressing climate displacement, India can help to ensure regional stability and security.</li>
   <li><strong>Economy:</strong> Climate displacement can have negative economic impacts, not just for the displaced people themselves, but also for the countries and regions they flee to. By investing in proactive measures to address climate change, such as renewable energy and sustainable agriculture, India can help to mitigate the economic impacts of climate displacement.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Climate displacement is one of the most pressing issues of our time. Millions of people in South Asia are at risk of being displaced due to the effects of climate change. India, as a global leader on human rights issues, has an enormous responsibility to address this issue head-on. By taking bold action to protect climate refugees, India can help to ensure a safer, more secure, and more prosperous future for everyone.</p>
