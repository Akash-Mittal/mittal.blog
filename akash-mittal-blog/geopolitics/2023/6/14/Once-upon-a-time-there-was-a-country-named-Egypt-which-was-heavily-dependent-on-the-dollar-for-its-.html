  <h1>Once upon a time, there was a country named Egypt, which was heavily dependent on the dollar for its imports from its trade partners. However, with the emergence of BRICS countries—Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa—Egypt realized that relying solely on the dollar was not sustainable in the long run.</h1></br> <img src="images/Once-upon-a-time-there-was-a-country-named-Egypt-which-was-heavily-dependent-on-the-dollar-for-its-.jpeg" alt="+Once-upon-a-time-there-was-a-country-named-Egypt-which-was-heavily-dependent-on-the-dollar-for-its-+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.firstpost.com/world/de-dollarization-egypt-drubs-dollar-in-trade-with-brics-nations-12733572.html" target="_blank" href="https://www.firstpost.com/world/de-dollarization-egypt-drubs-dollar-in-trade-with-brics-nations-12733572.html" rel="noopener">https://www.firstpost.com/world/de-dollarization-egypt-drubs-dollar-in-trade-with-brics-nations-12733572.html</a></span></h5>

  <p>Egypt started exploring alternatives and found that using local currencies like the Chinese yuan, Indian rupee, and Russian ruble could not only save it from the fluctuating exchange rates but also improve trade relations with these countries.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Let's take the example of Egypt's trade with China. In 2015, Egypt's foreign exchange reserves dipped dangerously low, and they needed a boost to stabilize the economy. The Chinese came forward with a $24 billion loan to fund their infrastructure projects in Egypt, and Egypt paid them back in yuan instead of dollars. That created a demand for yuan in the Egyptian market, and the yuan's value rose against the dollar, making it a win-win situation for both countries.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Similarly, India and Russia followed suit, and now Egypt's imports from these countries are primarily paid for in their local currencies. As a result, Egypt has reduced its dependence on the dollar and diversified its foreign exchange reserves.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The benefits of de-dollarization for Egypt are evident. Firstly, it reduces the country's vulnerability to the fluctuation of the dollar. Secondly, it can lead to lower transaction costs and increased trade with BRICS countries, resulting in better-balanced trade relations. Finally, it creates a beneficial shift in global economic power from the US, whose currency has been the dominant global reserve currency for decades.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, Egypt's step towards de-dollarization is a significant milestone in its path towards economic independence. The diversification of foreign exchange reserves and reducing dependence on the dollar bodes well for the country's future.</p>
