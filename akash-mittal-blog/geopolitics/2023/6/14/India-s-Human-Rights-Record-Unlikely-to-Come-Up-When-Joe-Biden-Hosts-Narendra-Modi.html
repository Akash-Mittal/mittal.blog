  <p>The relationship between countries is often influenced by their personal interests and the political climate. When leaders of two nations come together for discussions, there are topics that are off-limits or not discussed in detail.</p>
  <p>The same is expected when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits the USA for the first time since Joe Biden took office. While Modi's visit is expected to boost economic and strategic partnerships between the two countries, experts believe that human rights won't be a big topic of discussion during the meeting.</p>
  <h2>The Reluctance to Discuss Human Rights</h2>
  <p>The reluctance to discuss human rights violations during a state visit is not new. Countries often avoid difficult topics when discussing sensitive issues, especially when it affects their personal interests in trade or geopolitics.</p>
  <p>When Syrian President Bashar al-Assad visited Russia, human rights violations in Syria were not a topic of discussion. Thailand's military junta government visit to Beijing last year also avoided the topic of human rights abuses in the country.</p>
  <p>The same could be said for PM Modi's visit to the US. According to experts, the US and India have mutual interests in ensuring a successful state visit. The primary objective is enhancing economic relations and promoting strategic partnerships.</p>
  <h2>India's Human Rights Record</h2>
  <p>India's human rights record has been a topic of discussion in international forums for many years. The country faces multiple human rights issues, including police brutality, extrajudicial killings, and violence against women and minorities.</p>
  <p>The issue of farmers' protests, anti-conversion laws, and the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act has also put India's human rights record under scrutiny.</p>
  <p>India's treatment of religious minorities has been a growing concern in recent years. Muslims in India have faced increasing discrimination and violence since Modi's BJP government came to power in 2014.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <h3>George Floyd Protests - US and India</h3>
  <p>In May 2020, the death of George Floyd in the US sparked worldwide protests against police brutality and systemic racism. The issue also brought to light the usage of excessive force by law enforcement agencies worldwide.</p>
  <p>In India, the issue of police brutality and extrajudicial killings is not new. The country has several cases of custodial deaths, torture, and extrajudicial killings reported every year. However, the government has been slow to address these issues, and there are no significant changes in the policing system.</p>
  <h3>Kashmir Crisis - India and Pakistan</h3>
  <p>The Kashmir crisis has been ongoing since 1947, when India and Pakistan gained independence from the British Empire. The issue has been a source of tension between the two countries, with both sides claiming exclusive rights over the region.</p>
  <p>The conflict has resulted in thousands of deaths and human rights abuses, including torture and enforced disappearances. The Indian government has been accused of using excessive force in the region, and there have been reports of violations of international humanitarian law.</p>
  <h3>Religious Minorities - India</h3>
  <p>Since the BJP government came to power in 2014, there has been a rise in anti-Muslim sentiment and violence in India. The government has been accused of creating an environment of fear and intimidation and using Hindu nationalism to marginalize religious minorities.</p>
  <p>The Citizenship Amendment Act, which provides a path to citizenship for non-Muslim immigrants, has been criticized by human rights organizations. Critics say that it discriminates against Muslims and undermines India's secular constitution.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The US and India have a unique relationship, and both countries have benefited from their partnership in various sectors. However, India's human rights record cannot be ignored, and the issue needs to be discussed by world leaders to bring about positive change in the country.</p>
  <p>The primary objective of Modi's visit to the US is to strengthen economic and strategic partnerships, but human rights should not be ignored. The US government must take a stance on the issue of human rights violations in India and work with the Indian government to bring about positive change.</p>
