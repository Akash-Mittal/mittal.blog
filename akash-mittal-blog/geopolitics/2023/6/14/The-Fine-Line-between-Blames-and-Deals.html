  <p>Blames and deals have become a common theme in the current geopolitical landscape. Countries are pointing fingers at each other, while others are seeking ways to ease tensions. However, it's important to understand the consequences that come with each of these actions. One misstep can lead to an irreversible chain of events that can have dire consequences for the parties involved. Here's a look at some examples:</p>
  <h2>The Blame Game: Russia and Ukraine</h2>
  <p>Since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Russia and Ukraine have been at odds with each other. In recent times, both countries have been trading blames for various issues, including the recent destruction of an ammonia pipeline in Ukraine's Kharkiv. While Russia's Defense Ministry is pointing fingers at a Ukrainian sabotage group, Ukraine denies any involvement. The blame game only serves to worsen tensions between the two nations. Based on this trend, it's evident that more cooperation is needed for a peaceful resolution.</p>
  <h2>Seeking Deals: Brussels and Migrants</h2>
  <p>Another example of deals came in early July 2021 when the European Union (EU) unveiled a strategy to curb migration from Africa. The EU has pledged to invest nearly $12 billion in the next seven years to create jobs and promote education, among other things, in African countries. The idea behind the scheme is to create conditions that will convince potential migrants to stay in their home countries. This strategy is aimed at reducing the number of illegal migrants who arrive in Europe annually. With the number of illegal migrants on the rise, such deals are necessary to ensure the stability and security of countries in both Africa and Europe.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, blaming one party and seeking deals with another is an approach that doesn't always yield positive results. While it's important to hold those responsible accountable, it's crucial to focus on mechanisms that can lead to a peaceful and sustainable outcome. With tensions on the rise, countries and leaders must take a step back and assess their actions. The consequences of escalation may be too severe, and innovative diplomacy should be prioritized instead.</p>
