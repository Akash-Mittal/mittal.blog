  <p>Once upon a time, there were two countries - China and India. They shared a common border and a complex relationship. One of the issues that plagued their relationship was the treatment of journalists from each other's country.</p>
  <p>As China complains of unfair and discriminatory arrangements for its journalists in India, it is important to understand the gravity of the situation. Indian media has been quick to point out their own troubles in China, but that doesn't excuse the discrimination faced by Chinese journalists in India.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>The following are some examples of how Chinese journalists have been discriminated against in India:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>In 2018, Chinese journalist Lu Tan was denied a visa to India to cover the China-India border standoff.</li>
   <li>In 2016, a Chinese journalist was brutalised by police while covering a story in Uttarakhand.</li>
   <li>In 2015, a visa extension for Chinese journalist Lu Tang was denied, leading to her being forced to leave India.</li>
   <li>Chinese journalists in India have also complained of difficulty accessing interviews and other resources for their stories.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>The Other Side of the Coin</h2>
  <p>It is important to note that Indian journalists have also faced difficulties in China. In 2016, three Indian journalists were denied visas to cover a conference in China. The following year, another Indian journalist was also denied a visa to report on a UN event.</p>
  <p>However, this does not justify the mistreatment of Chinese journalists in India. Journalists should have the freedom to report on events and stories in any country, without fear of discrimination and harassment.</p>
  <h2>Finding Middle Ground</h2>
  <p>It's time for China and India to find a middle ground that allows journalists from both countries to work freely and report on important events and stories. The following are three ways in which this can be achieved:</p>
  <ol>
   <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Both countries need to be transparent about their visa policies and ensure that they are not discriminatory towards journalists from either country.</li>
   <li><strong>Training:</strong> Journalists from both countries could benefit from training programs that educate them on the culture, laws, and customs of the other country. This would help them work more effectively in the other country.</li>
   <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> There should be more opportunities for journalists from China and India to collaborate on stories. Working together would help break down stereotypes and promote a deeper understanding of each other's culture and viewpoints.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>China and India need to address the issue of discrimination towards journalists from each other's country. Transparency, training, and collaboration are key to finding a solution that works for both countries. It's time to put aside our differences and work together towards a brighter future.</p>
