    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>In today's world, where nuclear weapons have become a form of power and deterrence, the number of nuclear weapons a nation possesses have become a symbol of their strength and superiority. The three South Asian neighbors- India, Pakistan, and China, have been engaged in an arms race to achieve nuclear primacy. While India and Pakistan have been somewhat neck and neck in their nuclear stockpile, China is far ahead of the two. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute has recently released a report that reveals that India and Pakistan have comparable numbers of nuclear weapons in their stockpile, however, China aims to match its ICBM numbers with that of the USA or Russia by the turn of the decade.</p>

    <h2>Examples and Case Studies</h2>
    <ul>
     <li><h3>India</h3><p>With an estimated 150-160 warheads, India's nuclear stockpile is comparable to that of Pakistan's. India started its nuclear program in the 1960s, following China's nuclear test. The Pokhran-I test was conducted in 1974, and India became a nuclear-armed power in 1998, following its Pokhran-II tests. India has a 'no-first-use' policy, meaning it will not use nuclear weapons unless it becomes the target of a nuclear attack. India's nuclear strategy is based on a triad of land, sea, and air-based delivery systems. India's nuclear submarine, INS Arihant, provides India with the capability of a second-strike retaliation- that is a retaliatory attack after a nuclear attack has already been launched on India. This second-strike capability provides India with strategic stability, and is aimed at deterring Pakistan's first-strike capability.</p></li>
     <li><h3>Pakistan</h3><p>Pakistan began its nuclear program in the 1970s, in response to India's first nuclear tests in 1974. Pakistan became a nuclear-armed state in 1998, following its nuclear tests in response to India's Pokhran-II tests. Pakistan's nuclear stockpile is estimated to be around 160 nuclear warheads, giving it comparable nuclear capability to India. Pakistan's nuclear strategy is based on full-spectrum deterrence, meaning it has nuclear capability in all domains- land, air, and sea. However, with India's second-strike capability due to INS Arihant, Pakistan's chances of a successful first strike are significantly reduced.</p></li>
     <li><h3>China</h3><p>China is world's third-largest nuclear power, lagging behind only the United States and Russia. China has an estimated 290-320 nuclear warheads in its stockpile, which is larger than those of India and Pakistan combined. However, China's main objective is to match its ICBM numbers with the USA or Russia by the turn of the decade. China's nuclear strategy is based on minimum deterrence, meaning it has the capability to retaliate against a nuclear attack. China's second-strike capability is guaranteed through its land-based missiles and nuclear submarines. China's most advanced nuclear submarine, JL-2, is reported to have a range of 14,000 km and can carry up to 12 nuclear warheads, which makes it a significant threat to India and other neighboring countries.</p></li>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>The nuclear arms race between India, Pakistan, and China has been ongoing for decades, and shows no signs of slowing down. While India and Pakistan have comparable nuclear stockpiles, China remains far ahead of both.</li>
     <li>India's development of INS Arihant provides it with a second-strike capability, which is aimed at deterring Pakistan's first-strike capability. The nuclear submarine provides India with strategic stability.</li>
     <li>Pakistan's full-spectrum deterrence strategy aims to provide it with nuclear capability in all domains- land, air, and sea. However, with India's second-strike capability due to INS Arihant, Pakistan's chances of a successful first strike are significantly reduced.</li>
     <li>China's nuclear strategy is based on minimum deterrence, meaning it has the capability to retaliate against a nuclear attack. China aims to match its ICBM numbers with that of the USA or Russia by the turn of the decade, which would make it a significant threat to its neighboring countries.</li>
