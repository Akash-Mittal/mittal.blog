  <p>In the world of sports, particularly in cricket, India vs Pakistan match is undoubtedly one of the most anticipated events, given the political tension between the two nations. While sports are meant to bring people together and create a sense of unity, it often becomes a battleground of nationalism and rivalry.</p>
  <p>The upcoming India vs Pakistan match set for October 15 in the draft schedule of 2023 ODI World Cup is a stark example of how entertainment and politics are inevitably intertwined. The game of cricket, which should be a medium of enjoyment, gets marred by political interference that results in tension and aggression.</p>
  <h2>The political influence on the game of cricket</h2>
  <p>The history of politics in cricket is not new. Countries have often used sports as an instrument to showcase their power and position, sometimes even boycotting tournaments to serve political interests. In 1972, South Africa's apartheid regime was excluded from the Olympics, and in 1987, several countries boycotted the Commonwealth Games in protest against the policies of the then-British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.</p>
  <p>Similarly, India and Pakistan's political rivalry has long been reflected in their sporting events. In 1999, the Kargil war between the two nations had a direct impact on the cricket field, and a scheduled tour by the Indian cricket team to Pakistan was called off. The two countries have often played each other in neutral venues, and even during the World Cup, matches between the two nations are often tense affairs.</p>
  <h2>The impact on the players and the fans</h2>
  <p>The political tension between India and Pakistan, reflected in the game of cricket, has a profound impact on the players and the fans. While the players are under immense pressure to perform, they are also expected to maintain a certain level of decorum both on and off the field.</p>
  <p>Also, the fans of both sides often get over-zealous in their support for their teams and indulge in unruly behavior such as burning effigies and pelting stones. The high-decibel rhetoric that surrounds the game also fuels the fans' emotions, and they fail to understand that at the end of the day, it's just a sport.</p>
  <h2>The need for sports and politics to remain separate</h2>
  <p>While sports events might generate a lot of emotions, it is essential to understand that they should not be used as a tool for political propaganda. Sports should not become collateral damage in geopolitical disputes, and players should not be made to bear the brunt of such tension. Similarly, fans should remember that it's just a game, and they should support their teams without resorting to violence.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, it's high time that we stop mixing politics with sports. Sports, after all, should be a medium of enjoyment and not serve as battlegrounds of nationalism and rivalries. As the great Nelson Mandela once said: "Sport has the power to change the world. It has the power to inspire. It has the power to unite people in a way that little else does."</p>
