    <h2>An interesting story</h2>
    <p>India's Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. is a media and entertainment company that operates a variety of channels around the world. Zee is known for its popular television serials, movies, and music programs.</p>
    <p>In 2019, Zee announced that it would merge with Sony Pictures Networks India (SPNI) after receiving approval from the two companies' respective boards. However, since then, the merger has faced several obstacles, and the latest one is the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) promoter ban.</p>
    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>The SEBI promoter ban has left many investors worried about the delay in the merger between Zee Entertainment and Sony Pictures Networks India. There are concerns that the ban could extend the due diligence process and, therefore, prolong the time required for the deal to close.</p>
    <p>The media and entertainment industry has witnessed many mergers and acquisitions in recent years. One of the most significant deals was the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney in 2019. The acquisition was worth $71.3 billion and created one of the largest media conglomerates in the world.</p>
    <p>Another example is the acquisition of Time Warner by AT&amp;T in 2018. The merger was valued at $85 billion and created another media giant, which now owns HBO, CNN, and Turner Broadcasting, among other brands.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>India's Zee Entertainment is facing a delay in its merger with Sony Pictures Networks India due to the SEBI promoter ban. This has led to a drop in Zee's stock prices, which could continue in the coming days.</p>
    <p>However, despite the delay, the merger is expected to go through eventually. In the meantime, investors will monitor the situation closely and hope for a speedy resolution.</p>
