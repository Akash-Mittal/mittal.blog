   <h2>An Interesting Story...</h2>
   <p>Have you ever wondered why some natural disasters have names? In the past, people used to refer to them with numbers or geographical locations, or they would just be known as "that big storm." But in recent times, it has become a common practice to give them human names. It makes it easier for the public to remember and respond to the warnings, as well as for meteorologists to communicate with each other.</p>
   <p>So how does it work?</p>
   <h2>How Cyclones are Named</h2>
   <p>For tropical cyclones, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is responsible for the naming process. They maintain rotating lists of names that are reused every six years, unless a name is retired or changed due to a particular event.</p>
   <p>The names are usually based on languages that are relevant to the regions where the cyclones occur. For example, in the North Atlantic and East Pacific, the names come from English, Spanish, and French. In the Western Pacific, where typhoons are common, they use names from various languages of the Asia-Pacific region. In the Indian Ocean, they use names from different countries in the region, as well as from languages such as French and English.</p>
   <p>Here's an example of the list of names that will be used for the North Atlantic in 2021:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Ana</li>
    <li>Bill</li>
    <li>Claudette</li>
    <li>Danny</li>
    <li>Elsa</li>
    <li>Fred</li>
    <li>Grace</li>
    <li>Henri</li>
    <li>Ida</li>
    <li>Julian</li>
    <li>Kate</li>
    <li>Larry</li>
    <li>Mindy</li>
    <li>Nicholas</li>
    <li>Odette</li>
    <li>Peter</li>
    <li>Rose</li>
    <li>Sam</li>
    <li>Teresa</li>
    <li>Victor</li>
    <li>Wanda</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <p>One notable case of a retired name is "Katrina," which was used for the catastrophic hurricane that hit the Gulf Coast of the United States in 2005. The name was retired due to the severity of the storm and the high number of casualties and damages it caused. It was replaced with "Katia" in 2011.</p>
   <p>Another example is the super typhoon "Haiyan," which hit the Philippines in 2013 and was one of the most powerful storms ever recorded. The Filipino government decided to retire the name, as it brought back painful memories for the people who had suffered from the disaster. It was replaced by "Harold" in 2019.</p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/131108043042-14-tacloban-super-typhoon-haiyan-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg" alt="Super Typhoon Haiyan">
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>Naming cyclones is not only a practical way to communicate about them, but it also humanizes them and raises public awareness about the impacts of extreme weather events. However, it is important to remember that the names are just a small part of the overall preparedness and response efforts. Ultimately, it is the actions of individuals, communities, and governments that can save lives and minimize the damages caused by natural disasters.</p>
