  <p>Cricketers on both sides of the border might be sweating a tad bit more than usual, as the International Cricket Council (ICC), in association with the Board of Control of Cricket in India (BCCI), is all set to release the schedule of the ODI World Cup 2023. Why are they sweating, you might ask? Well, if rumours are to be believed, then India-Pakistan faceoff might take place in Ahmedabad! Now that's what we call a momentous encounter!</p>
  <p>India vs Pakistan cricket rivalry is considered to be one of the biggest spectacles in the world of sports. The stakes are high, emotions are higher, and the frenzy is at an all-time high. It transcends beyond mere cricket matches, where fans from both the countries get intensely engrossed in the performance of their teams, in an attempt to prove their dominance. The air is filled with excitement, and every cricketing fan, irrespective of their nationality, covertly roots for the team they want to win.</p>
  <h2>A Brief Lookback into the India-Pakistan Cricket Rivalry</h2>
  <p>The first Indo-Pak cricket match was played in 1952, and the two teams have since played over 130 matches against each other. Their rivalry on the field is often regarded as one of the most passionate and intense in international sports.</p>
  <h3>India vs Pakistan at the 2019 World Cup:</h3>
  <p>The India-Pakistan match at the 2019 World Cup in Manchester, England was one of the most anticipated clashes. In this sold-out encounter, India defeated Pakistan by 89 runs, with Rohit Sharma being the top scorer of the match. This match garnered global attention, with critics and fans alike describing it as one of the most dramatic matches in the World Cup.</p>
  <h3>India vs Pakistan at the 2007 T20 World Cup:</h3>
  <p>The India-Pakistan T20 World Cup final in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2007 was a cliffhanger. A young, inexperienced Indian team took the field against a star-studded Pakistan team. It was anyone's game till the last ball, but Misbah-ul-Haq's ill-advised and impulsive scoop resulted in his dismissal and a comprehensive win for India. Fans in India erupted in joy, and this win heralded the beginning of a new era of Indian cricket.</p>
