  <p>On the evening of June 15, 2018, an incident occurred that shook the entire world. The India China Galwan Valley Standoff between India and China resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers, including a commanding officer. While China also suffered casualties, the country remained tight-lipped about the numbers. It has been three years since the incident, and tensions between the two countries continue to simmer.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>The India China Galwan Valley Standoff is not an isolated incident. Tensions between the two countries have been brewing for decades, with both sides blaming each other for various provocations. Some of the key incidents that have taken place over the years include:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>1962 Sino-Indian War:</strong> This was a major war between the two countries that took place in 1962. India suffered a humiliating defeat, with China capturing a large part of the disputed territory in the Aksai Chin region.</li>
   <li><strong>2017 Doklam Standoff:</strong> In 2017, Indian troops entered Doklam, a disputed plateau between China and Bhutan. China responded with its troops, leading to a standoff that lasted for 73 days.</li>
   <li><strong>2020 Ladakh Standoff:</strong> The most recent standoff between the two countries began in May 2020, with both sides accusing each other of violating the Line of Actual Control. This resulted in violent clashes that left several soldiers dead.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>While these incidents may appear as isolated, they are all a part of a larger pattern of conflict and tension between India and China.</p>
