  <p>Once upon a time, Saudi Arabia and Iran were in fierce competition. The two nations were on opposite sides of many conflicts in the Middle East, and their rivalry often spilled over into proxy wars. However, in recent years, there have been signs of a possible rapprochement between the two regional powers.</p>
  <p>NUST Think Tank recently held a webinar to discuss this development. Experts from different fields, including international relations, diplomacy, and Middle Eastern studies, participated in the event. The speakers discussed the reasons behind the current thaw in the Saudi-Iranian relationship and its implications for the region.</p>
  <h2>The Case for Rapprochement</h2>
  <p>One of the main reasons for the possible rapprochement is the changing geopolitical landscape in the region. The United States, once an ally of Saudi Arabia, is now less interested in the Middle East. The Trump administration's policy of 'maximum pressure' on Iran failed to bring the regime to its knees and instead led to increased tensions between the US and Iran. The Biden administration is more focused on restoring the US' global standing and repairing its relationships with its traditional allies, including Iran.</p>
  <p>Iran, on the other hand, is feeling the impact of the US sanctions and is looking for a way out of its isolation. The COVID-19 pandemic has also hit the Iranian economy hard, and the regime needs to find a way to alleviate the suffering of its people. Saudi Arabia, too, is feeling the economic impact of the pandemic and the collapse of oil prices. The kingdom is looking for new ways to diversify its economy, and a detente with Iran could help in that regard.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Rapprochement</h2>
  <p>There have been several signs of a possible rapprochement between the two nations. In April 2021, Saudi Arabia and Iran held talks in Iraq, their first direct talks in years. The talks were described as 'positive' by both sides, and they agreed to continue the dialogue. In May 2021, the two countries held talks in Vienna as part of the negotiations to revive the Iran nuclear deal.</p>
  <p>The Saudi-Iranian rapprochement has implications beyond the two countries. It could help to de-escalate conflicts in the region and reduce the influence of external powers like the US and Russia. For example, the war in Yemen, which has been a major source of tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran, could be resolved through a negotiated settlement. Both countries could play a role in stabilizing Iraq and Syria, two countries that have been ravaged by conflict for years.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The Saudi-Iranian rapprochement is still in its early stages, and there are many obstacles to its success. Both countries have deep-seated historical and religious differences, and there are hardliners on both sides who oppose any detente. The US and Israel, too, are likely to resist any improvement in the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Iran.</p>
  <p>However, the NUST Think Tank webinar showed that there are reasons to be optimistic. The changing geopolitical landscape, the economic pressure on both countries, and the desire for regional stability could all drive Saudi Arabia and Iran towards a more cooperative relationship. The two countries have a long way to go before they can achieve a full rapprochement, but the fact that they are talking is a positive sign.</p>

  <p>The National University of Sciences and Technology's (NUST) think tank organized a webinar recently to discuss the possibility of a 'Saudi-Iranian Rapprochement'.</p>
  <p>For decades, Saudi Arabia and Iran have been bitter rivals in the Middle East, competing for regional influence and dominance.</p>
  <p>However, recent developments have given rise to the possibility of a thaw in relations between the two nations. One of the major factors that have contributed to this shift is the change in leadership in Saudi Arabia. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been at the forefront of this new approach, seeking to improve ties with Iran.</p>
  <p>During the webinar, experts from various fields shared their views on the prospects of a Saudi-Iranian rapprochement. One of the speakers was Dr. Muhammad Tayyab Safdar, an Associate Professor at NUST's School of Social Sciences and Humanities.</p>
  <p>Dr. Safdar highlighted the benefits that a rapprochement could bring for both nations, as well as for the wider region. He pointed out that a reduction in tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran could lead to greater stability in the Middle East and help to resolve conflicts in other countries, such as Syria and Yemen.</p>
  <p>Dr. Safdar also cited the example of the recent prisoner swap between Saudi Arabia and Iran as a sign of thawing relations between the two nations. The swap was facilitated by Iraq and involved the release of several prisoners on both sides.</p>
  <p>Another speaker at the webinar was Dr. Ali Akbar Farzadi, an Associate Professor at Iran's Islamic Azad University. He emphasized the need for a dialogue between Saudi Arabia and Iran to resolve their differences and build trust.</p>
  <p>Dr. Farzadi also pointed out that Iran has always been open to dialogue with Saudi Arabia, and it is up to the Saudi leadership to reciprocate this gesture.</p>
  <p>Overall, the webinar provided a platform for experts to exchange views on a topic that has significant implications for the Middle East and beyond.</p><!-- Conclusion, presented in 3 points -->
