  <p>Once upon a time, Saudi Arabia and Iran were in fierce competition. The two nations were on opposite sides of many conflicts in the Middle East, and their rivalry often spilled over into proxy wars. However, in recent years, there have been signs of a possible rapprochement between the two regional powers.</p>
  <p>NUST Think Tank recently held a webinar to discuss this development. Experts from different fields, including international relations, diplomacy, and Middle Eastern studies, participated in the event. The speakers discussed the reasons behind the current thaw in the Saudi-Iranian relationship and its implications for the region.</p>
  <h2>The Case for Rapprochement</h2>
  <p>One of the main reasons for the possible rapprochement is the changing geopolitical landscape in the region. The United States, once an ally of Saudi Arabia, is now less interested in the Middle East. The Trump administration's policy of 'maximum pressure' on Iran failed to bring the regime to its knees and instead led to increased tensions between the US and Iran. The Biden administration is more focused on restoring the US' global standing and repairing its relationships with its traditional allies, including Iran.</p>
  <p>Iran, on the other hand, is feeling the impact of the US sanctions and is looking for a way out of its isolation. The COVID-19 pandemic has also hit the Iranian economy hard, and the regime needs to find a way to alleviate the suffering of its people. Saudi Arabia, too, is feeling the economic impact of the pandemic and the collapse of oil prices. The kingdom is looking for new ways to diversify its economy, and a detente with Iran could help in that regard.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Rapprochement</h2>
  <p>There have been several signs of a possible rapprochement between the two nations. In April 2021, Saudi Arabia and Iran held talks in Iraq, their first direct talks in years. The talks were described as 'positive' by both sides, and they agreed to continue the dialogue. In May 2021, the two countries held talks in Vienna as part of the negotiations to revive the Iran nuclear deal.</p>
  <p>The Saudi-Iranian rapprochement has implications beyond the two countries. It could help to de-escalate conflicts in the region and reduce the influence of external powers like the US and Russia. For example, the war in Yemen, which has been a major source of tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran, could be resolved through a negotiated settlement. Both countries could play a role in stabilizing Iraq and Syria, two countries that have been ravaged by conflict for years.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The Saudi-Iranian rapprochement is still in its early stages, and there are many obstacles to its success. Both countries have deep-seated historical and religious differences, and there are hardliners on both sides who oppose any detente. The US and Israel, too, are likely to resist any improvement in the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Iran.</p>
  <p>However, the NUST Think Tank webinar showed that there are reasons to be optimistic. The changing geopolitical landscape, the economic pressure on both countries, and the desire for regional stability could all drive Saudi Arabia and Iran towards a more cooperative relationship. The two countries have a long way to go before they can achieve a full rapprochement, but the fact that they are talking is a positive sign.</p>
