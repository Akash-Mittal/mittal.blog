  <h1>Geopolitics Holds Pakistan Hostage</h1></br> <img src="images/Geopolitics-Holds-Pakistan-Hostage.jpeg" alt="+Geopolitics-Holds-Pakistan-Hostage+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://dailytimes.com.pk/1103084/geopolitics-holds-pakistan-hostage/" target="_blank" href="https://dailytimes.com.pk/1103084/geopolitics-holds-pakistan-hostage/" rel="noopener">https://dailytimes.com.pk/1103084/geopolitics-holds-pakistan-hostage/</a></span></h5>
  <p>The country of Pakistan has long been in the grip of its tumultuous geopolitical history. Its strategic location at the crossroads of South Asia, Central Asia, and the Middle East has made it a pawn in the hands of powerful nations vying for influence and control. This has led to a situation where Pakistan is struggling to break free from its past and chart a course for a better future.</p>
  
  <p>In 2001, after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US, Pakistan became a vital ally in the global war on terror. It allowed US forces to use its bases and territory to launch attacks against the Taliban in neighboring Afghanistan. This move brought billions of dollars in aid and military assistance to Pakistan, but it also brought a new wave of violence and instability to the country.</p>
  <h2>Examples with Case Studies</h2>
  <p>The rise of militant groups in Pakistan has been fueled by its geopolitical situation. The country's border with Afghanistan is porous and difficult to control, allowing militants to cross over and carry out attacks. The presence of US forces in the region has also inflamed anti-American sentiment among the population, leading to protests and violence.</p>
  <p>The US has also used drones to carry out attacks in Pakistan, which have caused civilian casualties and further stoked anti-American sentiment. The Pakistani government has been criticized for not doing enough to prevent these attacks and for not taking action against militant groups operating within its borders.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion in 3 points</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>Pakistan's geopolitical situation has led to a rise in militant groups and violence in the country.</li>
   <li>The country has struggled to balance its alliances with powerful nations like the US and China with its own interests and sovereignty.</li>
   <li>To overcome its geopolitical challenges, Pakistan must focus on improving its internal security, increasing economic development, and pursuing a more independent foreign policy.</li>
  </ul>
