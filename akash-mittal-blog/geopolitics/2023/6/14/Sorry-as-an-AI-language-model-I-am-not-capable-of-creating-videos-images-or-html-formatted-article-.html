  <p> Why Beijing is ‘forcing' last Indian journalist to leave country?</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The ongoing conflict between India and China has taken a new turn with Beijing authorities asking the last Indian journalist to leave the country. The move has raised a lot of questions about the transparency and openness of the Chinese government. This article will explore the reasons behind why Beijing is ‘forcing' the last Indian journalist to leave the country and its impact on journalism.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Story:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The role of journalism in a democratic society is to keep the public informed, hold the powerful accountable, and promote transparency. However, in countries like China, journalism is tightly controlled by the government, and journalists who are critical of the government are often targeted and silenced.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case Studies:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In recent years, several journalists have faced similar situations like the last Indian journalist in China. For instance, in 2019, China expelled three Wall Street Journal reporters over an opinion piece that criticized the Chinese government's handling of the coronavirus outbreak. The move was widely criticized by people all over the world as an attack on press freedom.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Similarly, in 2020, China expelled over a dozen journalists from major US media outlets, including The New York Times and The Washington Post. The move was seen as a backlash against the Trump administration's decision to limit the number of Chinese journalists in the US.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The current situation between India and China is a worrisome development for press freedom as it stifles the flow of information and limits the ability of journalists to do their job. It is crucial that the Chinese government allows journalists to work freely without fear of persecution or expulsion. Press freedom is a fundamental pillar of democracy and must be protected at all costs.</p>
