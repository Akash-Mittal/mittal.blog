Zee Group's promoters Subhash Chandra and Punit Goenka have appealed the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) against the Indian markets regulator's ban on them holding board positions in listed companies.
The ban imposed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) was prompted by allegations of insider trading and non-disclosure of price-sensitive information involving Zee Entertainment. The ban applies to Chandra, the founder of the Zee Group, and Goenka, the Managing Director and CEO of Zee Entertainment. The promoters have denied any wrongdoing and are seeking to have the ban overturned.
Zee Entertainment Enterprises is one of India's largest media and entertainment companies, with operations in broadcasting, digital media, motion pictures, and live entertainment. It is part of the larger Zee Group conglomerate, which was founded by Subhash Chandra in the 1990s.
Recently, Zee Entertainment has been embroiled in a scandal involving allegations of insider trading and non-disclosure of price-sensitive information. The company's shares plunged last year after a report by a foreign research firm alleged that the promoters were involved in insider trading.
SEBI investigated the matter and found evidence that Chandra and Goenka had traded in Zee Entertainment shares using unpublished price-sensitive information. The regulator also found that the promoters had failed to disclose their dealings in a timely manner. As a result, SEBI barred Chandra and Goenka from holding board positions in listed companies, including Zee Entertainment.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is the market regulator for the securities market in India. It was established in 1988 as a statutory body under the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act.
SEBI's primary function is to protect the interests of investors in securities and to promote the development of the securities market. It has wide-ranging regulatory powers, including the power to investigate and impose penalties for market infractions such as insider trading and non-disclosure of price-sensitive information.
SEBI's regulatory powers have been strengthened in recent years, following a series of high-profile corporate scandals in India. The regulator has imposed hefty fines and bans on individuals and companies found guilty of market misconduct.
The appeal by Zee Group's promoters against the SEBI ban raises questions about the regulator's powers and its ability to prevent market misconduct.
