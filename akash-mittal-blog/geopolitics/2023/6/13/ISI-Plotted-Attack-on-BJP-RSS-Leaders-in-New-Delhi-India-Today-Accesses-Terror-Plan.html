  <p>India Today has accessed exclusive documents related to the Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI)-plotted attack on Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leaders in New Delhi. The planned attack was aimed at disrupting the Indian democracy and creating unrest in the country.</p>
  <h2>The Shocking Details of the Attack Plan</h2>
  <p>According to the documents accessed by India Today, the ISI had planned to carry out a massive terrorist attack on the BJP and RSS leaders during a public event in the capital city of New Delhi. The plan included a coordinated attack on several leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, and BJP president Amit Shah.</p>
  <p>The attack was planned to be carried out by a group of terrorists who were trained and funded by the ISI. The terrorists were selected from various terror organizations, including Jaish-e-Mohammad, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Hizbul Mujahideen. The group was to be led by a Pakistani national who had been given the responsibility of executing the attack.</p>
  <p>The documents accessed by India Today also revealed that the ISI had planned to use the media to spread propaganda against the Indian government and create unrest among the masses. The ISI had planned to use social media platforms to spread fake news and incite violence.</p>
  <h2>The Importance of Stopping Such Attacks</h2>
  <p>The ISI-plotted attack on the BJP and RSS leaders highlights the need for better intelligence and security measures to prevent such attacks. The Indian government must take proactive steps to identify and neutralize the terrorist organizations that are operating in the country and are being funded and supported by foreign agencies. Such attacks not only threaten the security of the country but can also disrupt the political and social fabric of the nation.</p>
  <h3>Case Studies:</h3>
  <p>The Uri Attack: In 2016, a group of terrorists belonging to Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed attacked an Indian army base in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir. The attack claimed the lives of 19 soldiers and led to the escalation of tension between India and Pakistan.</p>
  <p>The 26/11 Attacks: In 2008, a group of terrorists belonging to Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba attacked the city of Mumbai, killing 166 people. The attack lasted for four days and shook the entire nation.</p>
  <h2>The Need for Stronger Measures</h2>
  <p>The Indian government needs to take a strong stance against foreign agencies that are funding and supporting terror organizations. The government must also strengthen the intelligence and security agencies to prevent such attacks in the future. The security forces must be equipped with the latest technology and must be given adequate training to deal with such situations.</p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>The ISI-plotted attack on BJP and RSS leaders in New Delhi is a wake-up call for the Indian government and the security agencies. The government must take proactive measures to identify and neutralize the terrorist organizations operating in the country and must work towards building a stronger and more secure India.</p>
