  <p>Giorgia Meloni, the leader of Italy's far-right party, Brothers of Italy, was known for her radical opinions and extreme nationalism. However, in recent years, she has been tamed by the forces of Neoliberalism and Geopolitics.</p>
  <p>It is no secret that politics is heavily influenced by money and power. In Giorgia Meloni's case, it was no different. She was swayed by the ideas of Neoliberalism, which advocates for free-market economics, deregulation, privatization, and reduction in government spending. Moreover, geopolitical forces also played a role in her transformation. As Italy's political landscape shifted, Meloni had to adapt her views to remain relevant.</p><!-- Examples with Case Studies -->
  <h2>Examples of Meloni's Taming by Neoliberalism and Geopolitics</h2>
  <p>One of the most notable cases of Meloni's taming was her shift towards supporting free-market economics. In the past, she had been critical of globalization and free trade agreements. However, as Italy's economy struggled, Meloni had to change her stance. She now advocates for deregulation and privatization, claiming that it is necessary to create jobs and boost economic growth.</p>
  <p>Another example of Meloni's transformation can be seen in her views on immigration. In the past, she had been a vocal supporter of closing Italy's borders and cracking down on illegal immigration. However, as Italy faced increased pressure from the EU to accept refugees, Meloni had to shift her stance. She now acknowledges the need for controlled immigration, claiming that it is necessary to maintain the country's economic stability.</p>
  <p>Finally, Meloni's views on foreign policy have also shifted in recent years. In the past, she had been a strong supporter of Russia and criticized the EU for imposing sanctions on the country. However, as Italy's relations with the EU improved, Meloni had to tone down her pro-Russian rhetoric. She now takes a more moderate stance, calling for improved relations with both Russia and the EU.</p><!-- Conclusion -->
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>Giorgia Meloni's transformation from a firebrand nationalist to a moderate politician highlights the power of Neoliberalism and Geopolitics in shaping political thought. As the world becomes more interconnected, politicians like Meloni must adapt to remain relevant. While some may see her shift as a betrayal of her principles, others view it as a necessary evolution in a changing political landscape.</p><!-- Reference URLs and Hashtags -->
