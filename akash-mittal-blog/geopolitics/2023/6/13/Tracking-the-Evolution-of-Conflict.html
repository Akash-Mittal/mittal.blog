   <p>War has been part of human history since the dawn of time. People seek power, wealth, and resources, and wars sometimes seem like the easiest way to achieve them. However, wars do not just bring prosperity and glory; they also bring destruction, suffering, and loss. That's why it's essential to track and monitor conflicts to prevent them from escalating and becoming more severe over time. In this article, we'll explore new ways to track violent conflict with real-world case studies and actionable conclusions.</p>
   <h2>Interstate Conflict Severity Barometer (ICSB)</h2>
   <p>The ICSB is a new approach to track the severity of militarized confrontations between pairs of states. It establishes a baseline for the relationship between a pair of states and then uses the incidence and severity of militarized confrontations to track variations around those baselines. The resulting score is scaled from 0 (no violent conflict) to 1,000 (rivalry plus severe militarized confrontations) for 2,631 different state-state relationships over the period 1900â€“2015.</p>

    <h2>Case Study: Russia and Ukraine</h2>
    <p>Since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia and Ukraine have had a complex and shifting relationship. In 2014, the conflict escalated when Russia annexed Crimea, leading to a severe militarized confrontation between the two countries. The ICSB score for Russia and Ukraine went from 97 (rivalry) in 2013 to 723 (war) in 2014, indicating a severe escalation of violence.</p>
   </div>
   <h2>Civil Conflict Barometer (CCB)</h2>
   <p>The CCB is another new approach to track violent conflicts within a country. It uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative data to measure the severity of a conflict. The CCB score ranges from 1 (low intensity) to 5 (high intensity) and is based on eight indicators, including the number of fatalities, refugees, and children affected by the conflict.</p>

    <h2>Case Study: Syria</h2>
    <p>The Syrian Civil War has been one of the deadliest conflicts of recent years, with over 500,000 people killed and millions displaced. The CCB score for Syria went from 3 (high intensity) in 2011 to 5 (extreme intensity) in 2013 and has remained at this level ever since. The conflict has resulted in widespread destruction and suffering, with civilians bearing the brunt of the violence.</p>

   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>Tracking the evolution of conflict is essential to prevent its escalation and minimize its impact on human lives. The ICSB and CCB are new approaches to measure the severity of interstate and civil conflicts, respectively. Real-world case studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of these barometers in tracking conflict over time. The insights gained from these measurements can guide policymakers and international organizations in preventing and resolving conflicts, promoting peace, and improving human lives.</p>
