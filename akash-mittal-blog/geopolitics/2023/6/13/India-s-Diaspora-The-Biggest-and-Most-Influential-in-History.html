   <p>How Indian expats are making their mark on the global stage.</p>
  </header>
  <main>
   
   <p>As a young girl growing up in the United States, Indra Nooyi had big dreams. She wanted to become a business leader, and she wanted to make her mark on the world. But in the 1970s, there weren't many Indian women in corporate America. Nooyi knew she would have to work twice as hard to succeed.</p>
   <p>Despite this challenge, Nooyi persevered. She went to Yale University and earned a degree in public and private management. She landed a job at strategy consulting firm Boston Consulting Group, and then moved on to work for several large corporations, including Motorola and ABB. But her biggest achievement came in 2006, when she was appointed CEO of PepsiCo, becoming the first woman of color to lead a Fortune 500 company.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Indian Diaspora in Action</h2>
   <p>Nooyi's story is just one example of how Indian expats are making their mark on the global stage. In fact, India's diaspora is now bigger and more influential than any in history. Here are just a few more examples of Indians who have made it big abroad:</p>
