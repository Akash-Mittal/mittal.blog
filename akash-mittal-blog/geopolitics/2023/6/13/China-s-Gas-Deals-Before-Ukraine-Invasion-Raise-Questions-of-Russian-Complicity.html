    <p class="intro">The relationship between China and Russia has been strengthened with various gas deals, which raises questions about their complicity in the Ukraine invasion. Here are some case studies to understand better.</p>
    <h2 class="sub-title">Case Studies:</h2>
    <h3 class="sub-sub-title">1. $400 Billion Natural Gas Deal between China and Russia</h3>
    <p>Back in 2014, the two countries signed a non-binding agreement for China to purchase Russian gas, with an estimated worth of $400 billion. This deal is considered one of the largest energy deals in history and has been viewed by geopolitical analysts as a way for Russia to counterbalance its dependence on European gas markets with a major new customer.</p>
    <h3 class="sub-sub-title">2. Gazprom's Supply Cuts to Europe</h3>
    <p>Another case study that raises questions is Gazprom's supply cuts to Europe in 2006 and 2014, which could have been a tactic to pressure Europe into accepting higher prices. During these times, Gazprom continued to supply natural gas to China through pipelines that are primarily located in Siberia.</p>
    <h3 class="sub-sub-title">3. The Nord Stream 2 Gas Pipeline Project</h3>
    <p>The Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which was approved by the European Union in 2019, is also being closely watched. The pipeline will transport natural gas from Russia to Germany, bypassing Eastern European countries. Many see this as a way for Russia to exert greater control over European energy markets and maintain leverage over countries like Ukraine.</p>
    <h2 class="sub-title">Conclusion:</h2>
    <ol class="conclusion">
     <li>The gas deals between China and Russia have raised concerns about their complicity in the Ukraine invasion.</li>
     <li>Gazprom's supply cuts to Europe and its continued supply to China suggest that Russia has used energy as a political tool in the past.</li>
     <li>The Nord Stream 2 pipeline project is seen by many as a way for Russia to maintain leverage over countries like Ukraine.</li>
