   <h2>Practice swing and seam</h2>
   <p>Akram emphasized the importance of swing and seam movement in English conditions, which can be challenging for bowlers who are used to playing on flat tracks that offer little assistance. He suggested that the Indian pacers focus on getting the ball to move both ways off the pitch, as this can help them trouble the New Zealand batsmen.</p>
   <p>Case study: During the 2019 Ashes series, Stuart Broad and Jofra Archer used the swing and seam to great effect and kept the Australian batsmen in check. Broad finished the series with 23 wickets at an average of 26.65, while Archer took 22 wickets at an average of 20.27.</p>
   <h2>Be patient and persistent</h2>
   <p>Akram advised the Indian bowlers to be patient and persistent and not get carried away by the swinging conditions. He suggested that they focus on bowling a consistent line and length and build pressure on the batsmen. He also recommended that the bowlers set up the batsmen by bowling a series of deliveries that look similar but have slight variations in line, length, and pace.</p>
   <p>Case study: During the 2014 Lord's Test between England and India, James Anderson bowled a fantastic spell on the fifth day and took 4 wickets for just 18 runs to help England win the match. Anderson used his skills of swing and seam, along with his ability to bowl a consistent line and length, to put pressure on the Indian batsmen.</p>
   <h2>Stay fit and rested</h2>
   <p>Akram stressed the importance of staying fit and rested and not overexerting oneself before such a big game. He suggested that the Indian bowlers should take regular breaks and get enough rest to avoid injuries and fatigue. He also recommended that the bowlers work on their strength and conditioning, as English conditions can be demanding on the body.</p>
   <p>Case study: During the 2015 World Cup, Australia's fast bowlers Mitchell Starc and James Faulkner played a crucial role in helping their team win the final against New Zealand. Both Starc and Faulkner had worked on their strength and conditioning before the tournament and were able to perform consistently throughout the tournament, despite the demanding conditions.</p>
