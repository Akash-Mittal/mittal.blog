  <p></p>
  <p>It was the year 2017 when China built an 800-meter-long motorable bridge in just two months across the Pangong Tso Lake in the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir. It was not just a mere bridge, but a statement of power and technical prowess of China over India. The bridge became an overnight symbol of China's infrastructure capabilities that made India look like a laggard in the race. This has been just one of the many instances where India has been lagging behind China on infrastructure front along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>China has been relentlessly investing in infrastructure around the LAC. This includes building highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, railway lines, and power grids. India, on the other hand, has been reactive in its approach and has been playing catch-up with China. However, India has been slowly but steadily matching up to the infrastructure capabilities of China along the LAC. In this article, we will explore how India is catching up with China on the infrastructure front along the LAC.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Examples</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) airstrip: India's strategic airbase at Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) close to the LAC in Ladakh was upgraded by the Indian Air Force (IAF) in 2013. It is the highest airfield in the world at an altitude of 16,614 feet. The upgrades included airstrip expansion, tarmac, and helipad. The airstrip serves as an important base for IAF operations in the region and has played a crucial role in the Indian response to Chinese incursions in the region.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Atal Tunnel: The 9.02-kilometre-long Atal Tunnel, named after former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, is the world's longest tunnel at an altitude of 10,040 feet above sea level. The tunnel connects Himachal Pradesh with the Ladakh region and reduces the distance between Manali and Leh by about 46 kilometres. The tunnel is expected to play a crucial role in facilitating the movement of troops and supplies in case of a conflict with China.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Leh-Kargil road: The Leh-Kargil road, which traverses the Zojila Pass, was labelled as a 'lifeline' for the Indian Army by Former Indian Army Chief, General Bipin Rawat. The road connects the Ladakh region to the rest of India and is crucial for logistics, supplies, and transportation of troops. India completed the construction of a 9.2-kilometre-long two-lane tunnel on the 434-km Leh-Kargil highway, thereby making it an all-weather road that can withstand harsh winters.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case Study</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The construction of the Rohtang Tunnel in the Himalayas is a prime example of India's transformation from a reactive to a proactive approach to infrastructure development along the LAC. The strategic and economic significance of the tunnel is immense. The 8.8-kilometre-long Rohtang tunnel, at an altitude of 3,978 meters, reduces the distance between Manali and Keylong by 52 km and the travel time by about five hours. Moreover, the tunnel provides year-round connectivity to the Lahaul-Spiti region, which used to remain cut-off for six months every year due to heavy snowfall.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The construction of the Rohtang tunnel posed numerous challenges such as high-altitude terrain, harsh weather, and labor and material shortage. Despite all the challenges, the project was completed within the estimated budget and time frame. The successful completion of the project not only demonstrates India's infrastructure capabilities but also challenges the popular narrative that China is way ahead of India in infrastructure development.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>India's infrastructure development along the LAC may have been reactive in the past, but it has come a long way in the past few years. India has demonstrated its capabilities in building strategic infrastructure, such as tunnels, airstrips, and roads, in some of the most challenging terrain in the world. India's approach to infrastructure development along the LAC has transformed from being reactive to being proactive, as seen in the case of the Rohtang tunnel. However, India needs to continue to invest in infrastructure along the LAC to match up to China's infrastructure capabilities.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, India may have been a laggard in infrastructure development along the LAC in the past, but it is slowly but steadily catching up with China. India needs to continue to be proactive in its approach to infrastructure development along the LAC to match up to China's infrastructure capabilities.</p>
