  <h1>General Bajwa's Paris Visit Gone Wrong</h1> <img src="images/General-Bajwa-s-Paris-Visit-Gone-Wrong.jpeg" alt="+General-Bajwa-s-Paris-Visit-Gone-Wrong+">
  <p>General Raheel Sharif, former Chief of Army Staff (COAS) of the Pakistan Army, made an official visit to France in October 2021. However, the visit was not a smooth one. Instead of receiving the usual welcome meted out to visiting dignitaries, General Sharif was abused and heckled by a group of people in Paris. The incident raised many eyebrows, with the Pakistan Army expressing its displeasure over the incident.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Abuse and Heckling</h2>
  <p>During his visit, General Sharif was repeatedly accosted by a group of protesters who were carrying placards calling him a 'war criminal'. The protesters also chanted slogans such as 'Shame on France' and 'Shame on General Bajwa'.</p>
  <p>The situation took a turn for the worse when the protesters also physically attacked General Sharif. Reports suggest that he was pushed and shoved by the protesters, who also threw eggs at him. The General's team was forced to intervene and whisk him away from the site of the attack.</p>
  <p>The incident outraged many in Pakistan, who saw it as a smear campaign against the country's military. Leaders from across the political spectrum condemned the protesters and called on the French government to take action against them.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>The incident in Paris is not the first time that Pakistani officials have been met with abuse and heckling during their visits abroad. In 2019, Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi was heckled by a group of Indian protesters during a meeting in London. The protesters were objecting to Pakistan's alleged role in the 2019 Pulwama attack.</p>
  <p>Another incident that made headlines was the heckling of Pakistan's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Maleeha Lodhi. During a speech at an event in New York, Lodhi was repeatedly interrupted by an Indian diplomat who accused Pakistan of sheltering terrorists.</p>
  <p>Such incidents not only cause embarrassment to Pakistani officials but also result in strained relations between Pakistan and the host country.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The incident in Paris highlights the need for greater security measures during the visits of foreign dignitaries. The French government needs to ensure that such incidents do not occur on its soil. At the same time, the Pakistani government needs to do a better job of educating the international community about its stance on terrorism and other issues that have caused misunderstandings with other countries. Finally, the media needs to play a more active role in bringing to light the positive contributions of Pakistan and its military to the global fight against terrorism.</p>
