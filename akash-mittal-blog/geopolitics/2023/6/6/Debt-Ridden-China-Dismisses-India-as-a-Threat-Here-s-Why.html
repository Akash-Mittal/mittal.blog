  <main>
   <p>China, the world's second-largest economy, is currently facing a major debt crisis, with its total debt-to-GDP ratio being around 280%, which is considered to be one of the highest levels in the world. Despite this, China is not backing down from its territorial ambitions and has been increasingly aggressive towards its neighboring countries, especially India.</p>
   <p>However, China recently dismissed India as a threat, and here's why:</p>
   <h2>China's Economic Woes</h2>
   <p>China's massive debt burden is a result of a combination of factors, including overinvestment in infrastructure, a surge in shadow banking, a cooling real estate market, and a slowdown in its economic growth. To overcome these challenges, China needs to focus on stabilizing its economy and address the underlying issues, instead of getting embroiled in a conflict with its neighbors, especially India.</p>
   <p>China's efforts to boost its domestic economy have been hindered by the ongoing trade war with the US and the COVID-19 pandemic. While India has its own set of economic challenges, it has managed to grow at a steady rate in the past few years, and China knows that it cannot afford to ignore India's potential as a strategic economic partner in the future.</p>
   <h2>India's Military Strength</h2>
   <p>While China may have a larger economy and a more powerful military, it cannot underestimate India's military strength. India is one of the world's largest arms importers and has been investing heavily in its military modernization program in recent years. India has also been enhancing its defense capabilities by forging strategic partnerships with other countries, such as the US, France, and Israel.</p>
   <p>China's military aggression towards India in recent years has resulted in a more robust response from the Indian military, with India also making territorial gains in the process. China's dismissal of India as a threat may be nothing more than a tactical move, as it fears that a prolonged conflict with India could further undermine its economic stability.</p>
   <h2>The Global Geopolitical Scenario</h2>
   <p>The global geopolitical scenario has undergone significant changes in recent years. The rise of India and other emerging economies has altered the balance of power, and China knows that it cannot afford to ignore these developments. China's growing influence in Asia and its Belt and Road Initiative have been viewed with suspicion by the US, India, and other major powers.</p>
   <p>China's rivalry with India could potentially trigger a wider conflict, which could destabilize the entire region. However, China also knows that it needs to maintain a stable relationship with India, especially in the face of increasing pressure from the US and its allies.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, China's dismissal of India as a threat may be driven by its current economic woes, but it cannot underestimate India's potential as a strategic partner in the future. As the global geopolitical scenario continues to evolve, it is in the interest of both China and India to maintain a stable relationship and focus on economic development, rather than territorial disputes and military aggression.</p>
