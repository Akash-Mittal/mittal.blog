   <h2>An Attempt to Muzzle Voices of Dissent in Kashmir</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>The State Investigation Unit (SIU) of India has arrested 58 persons in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) on charges of supporting freedom fighters and raising their voice against Indian atrocities. This is not the first time that India has used such tactics to oppress the people of Kashmir.</p>
   <p>India, since its independence in 1947, has been struggling with the issue of Kashmir, a territory that was divided between India and Pakistan. Both countries claim the region in its entirety and have fought several wars over it. India, which controls a significant part of the region, has been using brutal force to suppress the people of Kashmir who want to become a part of Pakistan or attain independence.</p>
   <h3>Examples of Oppression in Kashmir</h3>
   <p>India has been using various tactics to repress the struggle of Kashmiris. Some of these are:</p>
   <h4>1. Communication Clampdowns</h4>
   <p>In August 2019, the Indian government imposed a curfew and communication blackout in IIOJK, which lasted for months. The internet and phone services were suspended, and the locals were unable to contact their loved ones or access any information about the events happening around them. This made it easy for Indian forces to carry out human rights abuses without any accountability.</p>
   <h4>2. Illegal Detentions and Torture</h4>
   <p>The Indian forces have been accused of arbitrarily arresting and detaining the Kashmiris and subjecting them to torture. The locals are picked up without any charges, and sometimes it takes years for their trial to conclude. During this period, they are subjected to inhuman treatment, including rape and other forms of sexual abuse.</p>
   <h4>3. Use of Pellet Guns</h4>
   <p>The Indian forces use pellet guns on the crowds that gather to protest against Indian atrocities. These guns fire tiny metal pellets that cause severe injuries, sometimes even blindness. Pellet guns have caused many deaths and injuries in Kashmir, and the Indian government has refused to ban them.</p>
   <h3>SIU Arrests in IIOJK</h3>
   <p>The recent arrests conducted by SIU in IIOJK are another attempt to silence the voices of dissent in the region. These arrests come after the Indian government revoked the special status of the region in August 2019 and bifurcated it into two union territories, which made it easier for India to impose its will on the region.</p>
   <p>The people arrested are accused of providing financial and logistical support to freedom fighters and of inciting violence in the region. However, the civil society of Kashmir has condemned these arrests and has called it an attack on their freedom of expression and opinion. The arrests have caused widespread anger and resentment among the people of Kashmir.</p>
   <h3>Conclusion</h3>
   <p>The struggle of Kashmiris for their right to self-determination has been going on for over seven decades. India has been using repressive tactics to suppress their voices, but the Kashmiris remain determined to fight for their basic rights. The arrests conducted by SIU are another attempt to muzzle the voices of dissent in the region and to crush their spirit of independence.</p>
   <p>The world needs to take notice of the atrocities committed by India in Kashmir and to urge India to respect the human rights of Kashmiris. The United Nations and other international organizations need to intervene and put pressure on India to resolve the issue of Kashmir through a peaceful dialogue with all stakeholders.</p>
