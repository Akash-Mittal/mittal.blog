  <h1>Why Asia Still Fears Another Ukraine Despite US-China Handshake Fails</h1> <img src="images/Why-Asia-Still-Fears-Another-Ukraine-Despite-US-China-Handshake-Fails.jpeg" alt="+Why-Asia-Still-Fears-Another-Ukraine-Despite-US-China-Handshake-Fails+">
  <p>It was supposed to be a diplomatic breakthrough when US President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, held a virtual meeting in September 2021. The two leaders shook hands virtually, and the world watched with bated breath hoping that the meeting would ease tensions between the two superpowers.</p>
  <p>However, Asia remains unconvinced. The region still fears another Ukraine-like situation where great powers compete for influence, and smaller nations are left at the mercy of their ideological battles. In this article, we explore why the US-China handshake fails to stem Asia's fear of another Ukraine and its implications.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p><strong>Myanmar:</strong> Since the military coup in Myanmar in February 2021, China has been accused of supporting the military junta. The US has imposed sanctions on the junta, and Biden has called for a "united front" against the coup. However, China has been reluctant to condemn the coup and has argued for a "non-interference" policy in Myanmar's affairs. This has led to criticism of China's double standards and its partiality towards authoritarian regimes.</p>
  <p><strong>Taiwan:</strong> Taiwan has been a flashpoint in US-China relations for decades. China regards Taiwan as a renegade province and has vowed to reunify it with the mainland, by force if necessary. Biden has promised to support Taiwan's democracy and sovereignty, but he has also avoided provoking China. This balancing act has created uncertainty in Taiwan, which fears that the US may not come to its defense in case of a Chinese invasion.</p>
  <p><strong>Afghanistan:</strong> The US withdrawal from Afghanistan has raised concerns about China's influence in the region. China has welcomed the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan and has offered to help rebuild the country. This has alarmed India and other neighboring countries, which fear that China may use Afghanistan as a strategic base to challenge their interests.</p>
  <h2>Why Asia Fears Another Ukraine</h2>
  <p>Asia fears another Ukraine because it sees similarities between Ukraine and many of its own disputes with great powers like the US and China. Like Ukraine, many Asian countries are caught in the geopolitical competition between these two giants, and they fear that they may be treated as pawns in their power games.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, Asia fears that a US-China conflict may escalate into a military confrontation, which could threaten the region's peace and stability. Asian countries have been modernizing their militaries, and they fear that they may get caught in the crossfire if a war breaks out between the two superpowers.</p>
  <p>Moreover, Asia fears that a US-China conflict may lead to a new Cold War, which could create a divided world and force countries to choose sides. Asian countries do not want to be forced to choose between the US and China, as they depend on both for their economic and strategic interests.</p>
  <h2>Implications</h2>
  <p>The US-China handshake fails to stem Asia's fear of another Ukraine, and this has significant implications for the region and the world. Firstly, it increases the risk of regional conflicts as countries seek to balance against each other and hedge their bets. This creates a security dilemma where every action taken by one state is seen as a threat by others, leading to a spiral of tension and mistrust.</p>
  <p>Secondly, it undermines the prospects for regional cooperation and integration. Asian countries have been working towards greater economic and political integration, but the specter of a US-China conflict may derail these efforts. This could lead to a fragmented and unstable region, which could affect global economic growth and stability.</p>
  <p>Finally, it highlights the need for a new approach to international relations that takes into account the interests and concerns of smaller states. The US-China handshake may be symbolic, but it does not address the structural issues that underlie their competition. A new approach that focuses on dialogue, cooperation, and mutual respect is needed to create a more stable and secure world.</p>
