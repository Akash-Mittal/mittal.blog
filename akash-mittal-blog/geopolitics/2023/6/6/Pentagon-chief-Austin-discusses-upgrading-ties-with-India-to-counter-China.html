  <p>Washington: In a recent meeting with the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the US Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin discussed upgrading ties with India to counter China. The move comes as China continues its aggressive actions in the Indo-Pacific region, causing concerns for both the US and India.</p>
  <p>The US and India have been strategic partners since the signing of the US-India Civil Nuclear Agreement in 2008. The two countries have been working closely on various issues, including cybersecurity, defense, and trade. However, the recent discussions between the two nations show that they are now taking their relationship to the next level to counter the growing Chinese threat.</p>
  <h2>Examples of US-India strategic partnership</h2>
  <p>The US-India strategic partnership has already yielded some significant results in the past. Here are some examples:</p>
  <h3>1. Defense agreements</h3>
  <p>The US and India have signed various defense agreements, including a Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) and Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA), which are aimed at increasing defense cooperation and interoperability between the two nations. The US has also become India's second-largest defense supplier after Russia.</p>
  <h3>2. Cybersecurity cooperation</h3>
  <p>The US and India have been working closely on cybersecurity issues, including establishing a joint working group to combat cyber crime and sharing best practices. The two countries have also been discussing the possibility of entering into a bilateral cybersecurity agreement.</p>
  <h3>3. Trade partnership</h3>
  <p>The US and India have been working on strengthening their trade partnership. The two countries have been negotiating a trade deal for several years now, and while they have not been able to reach an agreement, the recent discussions between the two countries show that they are committed to finding a solution that benefits both nations.</p>
  <h2>What upgrading of ties mean for US-India relationship?</h2>
  <p>The upgrading of ties between the US and India means that the two countries will move beyond their current strategic partnership and work more closely to counter the growing Chinese threat in the Indo-Pacific region. This will involve the following:</p>
  <h3>1. Strengthening defense cooperation</h3>
  <p>The US and India will work towards strengthening their defense cooperation by signing more defense agreements and conducting more joint military exercises. This will help both nations to better coordinate and respond to potential threats from China.</p>
  <h3>2. Increasing economic and trade cooperation</h3>
  <p>The US and India will also look to increase their economic and trade cooperation by working towards a free and open Indo-Pacific region. This will involve negotiating a trade deal and promoting investment in the region.</p>
  <h3>3. Enhancing partnership in new areas</h3>
  <p>The US and India will also enhance their partnership in new areas such as cybersecurity, space exploration, and climate change. This will help both nations to leverage each other's strengths and address global issues that require collective efforts.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The upgrading of ties between the US and India is a significant development in the Indo-Pacific region. It shows that the two nations are committed to working together to counter the growing Chinese threat and promote regional stability. This move will not only benefit the US and India but also have a positive impact on other countries in the region. The US-India partnership is, therefore, a crucial pillar of regional security and stability.</p>
