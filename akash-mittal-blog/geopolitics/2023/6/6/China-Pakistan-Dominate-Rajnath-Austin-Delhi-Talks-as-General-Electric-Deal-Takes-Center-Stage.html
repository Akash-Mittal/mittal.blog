  <h1>China-Pakistan Dominate Rajnath-Austin Delhi Talks as General Electric Deal Takes Center Stage</h1> <img src="images/China-Pakistan-Dominate-Rajnath-Austin-Delhi-Talks-as-General-Electric-Deal-Takes-Center-Stage.jpeg" alt="+China-Pakistan-Dominate-Rajnath-Austin-Delhi-Talks-as-General-Electric-Deal-Takes-Center-Stage+">
  <p>As tensions rise between China and India, the recent talks in Delhi between Defense Minister Rajnath Singh and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin have brought to light a growing concern: China's increasing influence in India's backyard through its strong relationship with Pakistan. The talks also centered around the General Electric (GE) deal in India, which has been dominated by China and Pakistan.</p>
  <h2>China-Pakistan Relationship</h2>
  <p>Pakistan and China have had a long-standing relationship, with China providing military and economic aid to Pakistan since the 1960s. In recent years, this relationship has strengthened with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a $62 billion infrastructure project that connects Pakistan's Gwadar Port with China's northwestern region of Xinjiang.</p>
  <p>India has expressed concerns over the strategic implications of CPEC, as it passes through Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir, which India claims as its own territory. The project also gives China access to the Arabian Sea, which has worried India as it could potentially give China a strategic advantage in the Indian Ocean region.</p>
  <h3>Case Study: Gwadar Port</h3>
  <p>Gwadar Port, located in Pakistan's Balochistan province, has been a major point of contention between India and China. In 2013, China took over the management of the port and has since developed it into a deep-water port capable of handling large cargo ships. This has improved China's access to the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean, while also raising security concerns for India.</p>
  <p>In 2018, the Chinese navy deployed two warships to Gwadar Port for the first time, further raising concerns for India. While Pakistan has assured India that the port will not be used for military purposes, the fact that China has a military presence in the region is a cause for concern for India.</p>
  <h2>General Electric Deal in India and China's Domination</h2>
  <p>The General Electric deal in India has also been an area of concern for India, as China has dominated the procurement of GE products in India. In 2015, GE won a contract to supply India with locomotives, with the aim of modernizing India's rail network. However, China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation (CRRC) also bid for the project with a lower offer, and was ultimately awarded the contract.</p>
  <p>This trend has continued with several other GE deals in India, including a $2.6 billion agreement to supply gas turbines for a power project in Tamil Nadu, which was ultimately given to a Chinese company. This has raised concerns for India, as it fears that China's dominance in procurement will give it strategic advantage in the region.</p>
  <h3>Case Study: Hambantota Port</h3>
  <p>China's acquisition of Sri Lanka's Hambantota Port is a prime example of China's increasing influence in the region. In 2017, Sri Lanka handed over control of the port to a Chinese company on a 99-year lease, in exchange for debt relief. This has raised concerns for India, as it fears that China could use the port for military purposes, giving China a strategic advantage in the Indian Ocean region.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The talks between Rajnath Singh and Lloyd Austin have brought to light the growing concern over China's increasing influence in India's backyard, particularly through its strong relationship with Pakistan. The General Electric deal in India has also highlighted China's dominance in procurement, raising concerns for India over China's strategic advantage in the region.</p>
  <p>India needs to be cautious of China's expanding influence and should work towards strengthening its own relationships in the region. It should also focus on developing its own manufacturing capabilities, so as to become less reliant on foreign procurement</p>
