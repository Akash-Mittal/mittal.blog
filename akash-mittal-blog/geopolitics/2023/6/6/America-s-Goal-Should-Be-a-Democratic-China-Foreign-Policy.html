    <h2>The Story of Chinese Dissident Liu Xiaobo</h2>
    <p>Liu Xiaobo was a Chinese intellectual, literary critic, and human rights activist who fought for democracy and free speech in China. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 "for his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China." However, Liu Xiaobo was also a thorn in the side of the Chinese Communist Party and was sentenced to 11 years in prison for "inciting subversion of state power" in 2009. He died in custody in 2017 due to liver cancer, which some believe was caused by the lack of medical treatment he received while in prison.</p>
    <p>The story of Liu Xiaobo is just one example of the human cost of China's authoritarian regime and its disregard for basic human rights. It illustrates the urgent need for America to adopt a foreign policy that promotes the values of democracy, freedom, and human rights in China.</p>

    <h2>Case Study: Hong Kong's Pro-Democracy Movement</h2>
    <p>In 2019, Hong Kong was rocked by months-long pro-democracy demonstrations that were sparked by a controversial extradition bill that would have allowed people in Hong Kong to be extradited to mainland China. The protesters demanded greater democracy, free elections, and the protection of their civil liberties. However, the Chinese government responded with force, arresting hundreds of protesters, using excessive force against demonstrators, and passing a national security law that severely curtailed freedom of speech and assembly in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>This case study highlights the importance of a strong and principled American foreign policy towards China that supports the aspirations of pro-democracy activists and advocates for the protection of human rights and civil liberties.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion: 3 Reasons Why America's Goal Should Be a Democratic China Foreign Policy</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>To promote freedom and human rights: China's authoritarian regime suppresses political dissent, censors the media, and violates basic human rights. America should use its influence to promote greater freedom and democracy in China and support the aspirations of Chinese citizens who seek to live in a free and open society.</li>
     <li>To promote international stability: China's rise as a global superpower presents both opportunities and challenges for the international community. A democratic China that respects international law and human rights would be a more responsible and reliable partner in the international arena.</li>
     <li>To counteract authoritarianism: China's authoritarian model of governance is spreading to other countries, undermining the prospects for democracy and threatening global stability. America can play a critical role in countering this trend by promoting the values of democracy, freedom, and human rights.</li>
