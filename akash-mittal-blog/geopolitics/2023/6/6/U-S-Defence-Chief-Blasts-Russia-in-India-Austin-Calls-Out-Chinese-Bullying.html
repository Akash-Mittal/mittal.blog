    <p>US Defence Chief Lloyd Austin has called out Chinese bullying in the Indo-Pacific region and slammed Russia during his visit to India. Austin is on a three-day visit to India, aimed at boosting defence cooperation between the two countries. He met with Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and discussed issues related to defence pact, military exchanges, and technology transfers.</p>
    <p>"As we look at some of the aggressive actions that we've seen from China in the Indo-Pacific and beyond, we recognize that some of those same destabilizing actions have been mirrored by Russia as well," Austin said in a joint press conference with Singh. "And so, what we want to do in cooperation with other like-minded democracies in the region is to ensure that we maintain a balance of power in the region, and we do that through our defence cooperation."</p>

    <h2>China's Bullying in the Indo-Pacific</h2>
    <p>China has been increasing its military presence in the South China Sea, and has been aggressively asserting its territorial claims over the region. It has also been involved in a number of border disputes with India. In June 2020, Chinese troops clashed with Indian soldiers in the Galwan Valley, which resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese casualties. Since then, diplomatic efforts have been ongoing to resolve the issue, but tensions remain high.</p>
    <p>Austin's visit to India comes just a week after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin held talks with their counterparts from Japan and South Korea in Tokyo. The Quad alliance, comprising India, Japan, Australia and the US, has been seen as a counter to China's growing dominance in the region.</p>
    <p>"We're looking at opportunities to work with India in the Indo-Pacific, and beyond, to ensure that we maintain that balance of power, so that we don't allow any one country to dominate the region," Austin said.</p>
    <p>India and the US have been increasing their defence ties over the past few years, with India being one of the largest buyers of US military equipment. The two countries signed a defence pact, the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement for Geo-Spatial Cooperation, in 2020, which enables them to share military satellite data with each other.</p>

    <h2>Russia's Weapons Sales to India's Neighbours</h2>
    <p>Austin also criticised Russia for selling weapons to India's neighbours, which he said was undermining India's security. He did not name any specific countries, but reports suggest that he was referring to Pakistan.</p>
    <p>India and Pakistan have a long-standing border dispute, and Pakistan has been accused of supporting terrorism in India. India has also been concerned about China's growing influence in Pakistan.</p>
    <p>"We certainly look to have a dialogue with Russia as well, because we think it's important that we talk about the issues, about the concerns, that we have with some of their activities that they've been engaged in as well," Austin said.</p>
    <p>India and Russia have been close allies for decades, with India being one of the biggest importers of Russian weapons. However, India has been diversifying its defence supplies in recent years, and has been buying more weapons from the US and other countries.</p>

   <section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Austin's visit to India is seen as a sign of the growing defence ties between the two countries, and their shared concerns about China's growing dominance in the region. India has been expanding its defence ties with other countries, such as Japan, Australia and France, in order to counter China's increasing assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
    <p>As China and Russia ramp up their military activities in the region, it is becoming increasingly important for countries to work together to maintain a balance of power. The Quad alliance, comprising India, Japan, Australia and the US, is one such effort to counter China's influence in the region.</p>
    <p>The outcome of Austin's visit to India remains to be seen, but it is clear that both countries are keen to deepen their defence ties and work towards ensuring stability and peace in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
