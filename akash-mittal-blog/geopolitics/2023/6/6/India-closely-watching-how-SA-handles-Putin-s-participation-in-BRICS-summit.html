  <h1>India closely watching how SA handles Putin's participation in BRICS summit</h1> <img src="images/India-closely-watching-how-SA-handles-Putin-s-participation-in-BRICS-summit.jpeg" alt="+India-closely-watching-how-SA-handles-Putin-s-participation-in-BRICS-summit+">
  <p></p>
  <p>It's no secret that Russia and India have shared a close relationship for the longest time. From defence ties to strategic partnerships, the two countries have stood by each other through thick and thin. And now, with the upcoming Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (BRICS) summit in Johannesburg, India is closely watching how South Africa handles Russian President Vladimir Putin's participation.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>India will play a key role in this summit, especially with its new Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, set to attend. The summit's theme is ‘BRICS in Africa: Collaboration for Inclusive Growth and Shared Prosperity in the 4th Industrial Revolution,' and India is hoping to strengthen its economic, political, and strategic bonds with the African continent.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>However, with Putin's participation, the dynamics could shift towards the uneasy relationship that Russia has with the Western world. The ongoing conflict in Syria, the annexation of Crimea, and accusations of election interference are just some of the points of contention that Moscow has with the rest of the world.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>India, with its ‘non-alignment' policy, has always tried to maintain a balance in its relationships with different countries. But with the current global scenario, it might not be that easy. The BRICS summit could be a test of India's diplomatic skills and South Africa's ability to handle a sensitive situation.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case Studies:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The ongoing conflict in Syria is a classic example of how global powers have opposing viewpoints, but the situation has escalated so much that any one wrong move could lead to a world war. India has expressed concern over the use of chemical weapons in Syria, but it has not taken a firm stance.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Similarly, India has tried to maintain neutrality when it comes to Russia and China's military build-up in the Arctic, but it can no longer ignore its impact on the environment and the stability of the region.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>On the other hand, India has tried to balance its relationships with the US and Russia. It has signed a number of defence deals with the US, but it has also signed a contract for the supply of the S-400 air defence system from Russia, much to the chagrin of the US.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In light of the above, the BRICS summit will be a crucial test for India's diplomacy and South Africa's ability to handle sensitive situations. The summit will provide a platform for India to strengthen its ties with Africa and for Russia to showcase its strength in the global power play.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>India will have to tread cautiously and balance its relationships with different countries, especially in a time when the world is moving towards a chaotic space. It must find a way to maintain its strategic alliances without compromising on its core values of peace and stability.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>As for South Africa, it must show that it can handle this sensitive situation diplomatically, and work towards a peaceful resolution. It must make the summit a success, not only for the participating countries but for the stability of the global community.</p>
