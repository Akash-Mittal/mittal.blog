  <h1>How Hindu Nationalists Became Best Friends With Israel</h1> <img src="images/How-Hindu-Nationalists-Became-Best-Friends-With-Israel-Jacobin.jpeg" alt="+How-Hindu-Nationalists-Became-Best-Friends-With-Israel-Jacobin+">
  <p>India's ruling party, the BJP, has long been accused of promoting a divisive and exclusionary form of Hindu nationalism. But in recent years, the party has also forged a close relationship with Israel, a country known for its aggressive military policies and settlement expansion in the occupied Palestinian territories. How did this unlikely alliance come about?</p>
  <h2>The Rise of Hindu Nationalism</h2>
  <p>Since coming to power in 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP have implemented a number of controversial policies aimed at promoting a Hindu-centric vision of India. These include revoking the autonomy of the Muslim-majority region of Kashmir, instituting a controversial citizenship law that critics say discriminates against Muslims, and clamping down on dissent and protest through draconian laws.</p>
  <p>At the same time, the BJP has sought to strengthen ties with Israel, an ally that shares its vision of a strong, nationalist state. As a result, India has become one of Israel's closest and most reliable partners in Asia.</p>
  <h2>The Role of Zionism</h2>
  <p>One factor that has helped bring Hindu nationalists and Zionists together is the idea of "Zionism" - the belief in a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Some Hindu nationalists see similarities between Zionism and their own vision of a Hindu state, with both movements advocating for the interests of a particular religious or ethnic group.</p>
  <p>In addition, Israel has long been seen as a valuable partner for India in terms of security cooperation and counter-terrorism, given its own experiences fighting terrorism and its expertise in cyber warfare. India has also benefited from Israel's advanced military technology, such as its unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and missile defense systems.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Collaboration</h2>
  <p>The growing friendship between Hindu nationalists and Israel has manifested in a variety of ways. In 2017, Modi became the first Indian prime minister to visit Israel, with Netanyahu describing the visit as a "historic moment" in the two countries' relationship. Since then, India and Israel have signed several major defense deals, including the joint development of a new missile that can shoot down incoming rockets.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, Hindu nationalists have promoted the idea of an "Hindu Zionism" that would seek to create a Hindu state modeled on Israel. Proponents of this idea argue that just as Israel provides a homeland for Jews around the world, a Hindu state would provide a refuge for Hindus facing persecution in neighboring countries.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The growing friendship between Hindu nationalists and Israel raises important questions about the foreign policy priorities of both countries, and the impact of their collaboration on the broader geopolitical landscape. While Israel has long sought to build alliances in the Arab and Muslim worlds, its partnership with India risks alienating some of its traditional allies.</p>
  <p>At the same time, the BJP's embrace of Israel has been criticized as inconsistent with India's traditional support for the Palestinian cause and its commitment to secularism and multiculturalism. As the Indian government continues to push its nationalist agenda, it remains to be seen how its relationship with Israel will evolve - and what the consequences of this shift will be for both countries.</p>
