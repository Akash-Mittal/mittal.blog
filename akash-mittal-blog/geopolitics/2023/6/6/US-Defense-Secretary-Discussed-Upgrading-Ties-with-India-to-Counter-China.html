  <p>The United States has discussed upgrading ties with India as a means to counter China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Defense Minister Rajnath Singh on his recent visit to New Delhi to discuss this and other issues. While formal agreements were not announced, the meeting was the latest sign of the US government's support for India as a strategic partner, especially in light of Chinese assertiveness in the region.</p>
  <h2>Example 1: Joint Military Exercises and Sales</h2>
  <p>The United States and India have already increased their military cooperation in recent years, including joint military exercises and sales of advanced defense technology. For example, the two countries participated in the Malabar naval exercise in the Arabian Sea in November 2020, along with Japan and Australia. The exercise was seen as a signal of the growing cooperation among the four nations to counter China's naval expansion in the region.</p><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/14CD3/production/_117017352_india_usnavy_epa.jpg" alt="US and Indian navy vessels sailing side by side">
  <p>In addition, the United States has approved the sale of advanced military hardware, such as Apache helicopters and Patriot missile defense systems, to India in recent years. These sales serve both countries' strategic interests, with India seeking to modernize its military and the United States looking to expand its presence and influence in the region.</p>
  <h2>Example 2: Economic and Diplomatic Cooperation</h2>
  <p>While the military aspect of the US-India partnership receives much attention, there are also opportunities for economic and diplomatic cooperation. In recent years, the two countries have sought to strengthen their trade ties, as seen in the US-India Strategic Energy Partnership and the US-India 2+2 Dialogue.</p>
  <p>Moreover, both countries have aligned themselves with each other on global issues, such as the fight against climate change and the need for democratic values and human rights. As two of the world's largest democracies, the United States and India have a shared interest in upholding these values and promoting them globally.</p>
  <h2>Example 3: Balancing Power in the Indo-Pacific Region</h2>
  <p>The US-India partnership is not just about bilateral relations, but also about balancing power in the Indo-Pacific region. As China continues to assert its dominance in the region, the United States and India provide a counterbalance to its influence. This is seen in the increasing cooperation among the four nations mentioned earlier, known as the Quad, which seeks to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific region.</p>
  <blockquote>
   "We firmly believe that a stronger partnership with India is critical for the United States to tackle the challenges of the 21st century, from the COVID pandemic and climate change to a rising China and an increasingly unstable global landscape." - Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin
  </blockquote>
  <p>As the United States seeks to sustain its global leadership and India seeks to assert itself as a regional power, the two countries see each other as strategic partners. By working together, they can challenge China's influence and ensure a balance of power in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The United States' discussion of upgrading ties with India to counter China's influence in the region is not surprising, given recent tensions between the two superpowers. However, the US-India partnership has been growing for several years and includes both military and non-military aspects. This partnership represents not only a strategic alliance between two powerful nations but also a balancing force in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
