  <p>In the summer of 2020, the world watched as India and China engaged in deadly clashes along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The LAC separates the two nuclear-armed neighbors and is the reason behind their continuing territorial dispute. So, what exactly are the friction points on the LAC?</p>
  <h2>Friction Points Explained</h2>
  <p>The LAC is a 3,488 km-long unmarked border between India and China that stretches from Ladakh in the west to Arunachal Pradesh in the east. The border has its roots in history and politics, including the 1914 McMahon Line demarcated by the British Raj and the 1962 Sino-Indian War.</p>
  <p>Over the years, India and China have disagreed on the precise location of the border, leading to frequent tensions and skirmishes. Here are some of the most contentious friction points:</p>
  <h3>1. Ladakh</h3>
  <p>Ladakh is a region in the northernmost part of India, bordering Tibet to the east, Pakistan to the west, and Xinjiang to the north. It is home to several disputed areas along the LAC, including the hotly contested Pangong Tso lake.</p>
  <p>In 2020, tensions rose between the two countries when India accused China of crossing the LAC and occupying Indian territory in the Galwan Valley in Ladakh. The clashes between the two sides resulted in the deaths of at least 20 Indian soldiers.</p>
  <h3>2. Doklam</h3>
  <p>Doklam is a plateau in the tri-junction of India, China, and Bhutan. In 2017, Chinese soldiers were reported to have entered the Doklam region and started building a road. India responded by sending its troops to stop the construction, leading to a tense standoff for several months.</p>
  <h3>3. Arunachal Pradesh</h3>
  <p>Arunachal Pradesh is a northeastern state of India that shares a border with Tibet. China has often claimed that Arunachal Pradesh is a part of its territory, which India has consistently rejected.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <h3>1. The Galwan Valley Clash</h3>
  <p>On June 15, 2020, clashes broke out between Indian and Chinese soldiers in the Galwan Valley in Ladakh. The incident resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers and an unknown number of Chinese troops. Both sides blamed each other for the clash, with China claiming that India had crossed the border.</p>
  <p>The clashes were preceded by several weeks of tensions between the two countries, with Chinese troops reportedly crossing the LAC and occupying Indian territory in Pangong Tso. The incident led to widespread public outrage in India and a diplomatic row between the two countries.</p>
  <h3>2. The Doklam Standoff</h3>
  <p>In 2017, tensions rose between India and China over the Doklam plateau, which is contested by both India and China's ally Bhutan. The standoff began when Chinese troops started building a road in Doklam, which India considered a strategic threat.</p>
  <p>India responded by sending its troops to block the construction, leading to a tense standoff that lasted for several months. The situation was defused only after high-level talks between the two countries.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>India and China's ongoing border dispute has been a source of tension between the two countries for decades. The LAC remains the most contentious friction point between them, with both sides accusing the other of crossing the border into their territory.</p>
  <p>Given the geopolitical and strategic significance of the region, it is unlikely that the two countries will resolve their differences anytime soon. However, it is essential that India and China engage in dialogue and diplomacy to prevent further escalation of tensions along the LAC.</p>
