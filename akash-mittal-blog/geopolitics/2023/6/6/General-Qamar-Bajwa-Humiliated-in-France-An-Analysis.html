    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>In October 2021, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) of Pakistan, was on a visit to France where he was attending a defence conference. While he was waiting for his car outside the conference venue, an Afghan man approached him and hurled abuses at him in Dari, the Persian language spoken in Afghanistan.</p>
    <p>The incident was captured on video and went viral on social media, causing a stir in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. The video shows the Afghan man shouting at General Bajwa, accusing him and the Pakistani military of being responsible for the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan and for the deaths of innocent Afghans. General Bajwa, who was surrounded by his security detail, remained calm and did not respond to the verbal attack.</p>

    <h2>Examples and Case Studies</h2>
    <p>The incident of the Afghan man verbally abusing General Bajwa in France highlights the complex and sensitive nature of Pakistan's relationship with Afghanistan. The two countries share a long and porous border that has seen decades of conflict, with Pakistan often accused of supporting militant groups in Afghanistan. The Taliban, who recently took control of Afghanistan, have close ties with Pakistan's military establishment, which has led to accusations that Pakistan played a role in their victory.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the incident also raises questions about the image and reputation of Pakistan's military establishment in the international community. General Bajwa, who is one of the most powerful figures in Pakistan, is often seen as the face of the military establishment. The incident in France, where he was humiliated by an Afghan man, could be seen as a blow to his and Pakistan's prestige on the world stage.</p>
    <p>There have been previous incidents where Pakistani officials have been similarly humiliated on the international stage. In 2011, the then-Prime Minister of Pakistan, Yousaf Raza Gilani, was asked to take off his shoes and undergo a security check at a US airport, causing outrage in Pakistan. In 2016, the Pakistani ambassador to the United Nations, Maleeha Lodhi, was caught on camera tweeting a picture of a Palestinian girl as a victim of the conflict in Kashmir, leading to criticism and embarrassment for Pakistan.</p>
    <p>These incidents highlight the need for Pakistan's military and political leadership to carefully consider their actions and their responses to international events. They also underscore the importance of diplomacy and international relations in the modern world, where a single incident or a single misstep can have far-reaching consequences.</p>
