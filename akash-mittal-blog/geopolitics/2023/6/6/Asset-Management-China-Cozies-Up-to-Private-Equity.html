  <h1>Asset Management China Cozies Up to Private Equity</h1> <img src="images/Asset-Management-China-Cozies-Up-to-Private-Equity.jpeg" alt="+Asset-Management-China-Cozies-Up-to-Private-Equity+">
  <p>In the world of finance, few relationships have been as fraught as that of asset management and private equity. For years, the two industries have competed for assets and talent, with each side accusing the other of being too aggressive or too cautious.</p>
  <p>In recent years, however, there has been a new trend emerging in the Chinese financial sector. Asset management firms are increasingly teaming up with private equity firms to unlock hidden value in companies that are difficult to assess or are facing financial challenges.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>One example of this trend is the collaboration between China Asset Management Company (ChinaAMC) and CDH Investments. In 2018, the two firms partnered to acquire a controlling stake in Maike Group, a Chinese coal trader. The company had been struggling due to falling coal prices and rising debt, but ChinaAMC and CDH saw potential in the business if it could be restructured and brought into compliance with environmental regulations.</p>
  <p>Under the new ownership structure, Maike Group underwent significant reforms, including the sale of non-core assets, the creation of a new management team, and an overhaul of its compliance procedures. Within two years, the company was able to reduce its debt-to-equity ratio from over 200% to less than 70% and become profitable once again.</p>
  <p>Another example of this trend is the partnership between Hwabao Trust and SAIF Partners. The two firms joined forces to acquire a 51% stake in China Shandong Hi-Speed Financial Group, a company that primarily invests in transportation infrastructure projects such as toll roads and airports. The investment was made at a time when the Chinese government was investing heavily in infrastructure, and the partners believed that Hi-Speed Financial Group's portfolio was undervalued.</p>
  <p>Over the next few years, Hwabao and SAIF worked closely with the management team at Hi-Speed Financial Group to reassess the company's investment strategy and improve its risk management practices. The partnership paid off, and in 2019, the company went public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange with a market capitalization of HK$8.6 billion.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>These and other examples demonstrate the value that can be unlocked when asset management firms and private equity firms work together. By combining their expertise in financial analysis, risk management, and operational improvement, these partnerships are able to identify undervalued companies, assess their potential, and create value for their investors.</p>
  <p>This trend is also a reminder that the Chinese financial sector is continuing to evolve and innovate, as firms seek new ways to create value for their clients and capture new market opportunities. As asset management firms and private equity firms continue to collaborate and push the boundaries of what is possible, we can expect to see even more exciting developments in the years ahead.</p>
