In June 2017, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived at the White House for his first face-to-face meeting with President Donald Trump. The meeting was closely watched by foreign policy analysts around the world, as many wondered whether the two leaders would be able to build a strong relationship despite their many differences.

In 1991, India was on the verge of economic collapse. The country had only 3 weeks' worth of foreign reserves left, and its inflation rate was at a staggering 17%. Desperate, India turned to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a bailout of $2.2 billion. Fast forward to 2021, India has become the world's sixth-largest economy, with a GDP of $2.7 trillion. Its rapid growth has caught the attention of the United States, which is now courting India for its economic potential.
One of the most notable examples of America's courting of India is the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF), a policy advocacy and business development organization that aims to strengthen economic ties between the two countries. Founded in 2017, the USISPF has already facilitated over $40 billion in business deals between Indian and American companies.

It is a well-known fact that justice delayed is justice denied. This maxim was proved true recently when China blocked India's proposal to blacklist Sajid Mir, one of the accused in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks. The move came as a major disappointment for India, which had been looking for justice for the victims of the attacks.
To understand the gravity of the situation, let us delve a little deeper into the Mumbai terror attacks. On November 26, 2008, a group of terrorists arrived in Mumbai from Pakistan and launched a series of coordinated attacks that lasted for four days. The attacks were carried out in popular places like the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, the Oberoi Trident Hotel, and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station. The attacks left 166 people dead, including foreign nationals, and more than 300 people injured.

It's the year 2050, and Mr. Shah has a smile on his face. As he looks out of his window and beholds the bustling city that once used to be a small town, he reminisces about his journey. Mr. Shah came from a humble background and had to work extraordinarily hard to provide for his family. Today, he is the proud owner of a successful manufacturing unit that has been consistently growing over the past few years.
It's fascinating to note that this success story is not an isolated case. Despite facing significant challenges, India's economy continues to soar. The manufacturing sector has slowly but steadily recovered, there is geopolitical unrest, and the risk of an El Nino still looms, but the economy might grow at 6.5% in 2023 despite all these obstacles.

Once upon a time in a land far away, people lived in harmony with nature, freely accessing its plentiful resources. But then came the industrial age and with it, rapid economic development, population growth and resource depletion. And now, many Asian countries are facing an acute resource shortage, leading to a new phase of competition and resource diplomacy.
Asia accounts for over half of the world's population and is home to some of the world's fastest-growing economies. This rapid growth, however, is putting enormous pressure on natural resources, leading to increasingly fierce competition among Asia's nations and regions.

It was a sunny day in Minsk, the capital city of Belarus, when I happened to meet a group of local students who were interested in politics and international affairs. As we chatted over a cup of coffee, I asked them about their views on democracy and human rights, given that Belarus is often criticized for its lack of political freedoms and repression of dissent. To my surprise, they replied that while they value these principles, they also recognize the importance of their country's geopolitical position and its relations with powerful neighbors such as Russia and China.

Once upon a time, a small business owner named John decided to import some goods from China. However, he faced numerous challenges such as high tariffs, language barriers, and complicated regulations. John started to question why the U.S government continued to have a friendly relationship with China and eased trade restrictions, while small businesses like himself struggled to compete. Unfortunately, this story has become a reality under the Biden Administration.
President Biden has taken a softer stance on China, removing some of the sanctions and tariffs imposed by the previous administration. One significant example is the revocation of the ban on Chinese apps, such as TikTok and WeChat. Additionally, the Biden Administration has relaxed the travel ban and suspended Trump's executive orders on WeChat and TikTok's operations. These moves are seen as a shift in favor of Chinese interests, allowing them to expand their foothold in the U.S.

One such ally is India, a country that has faced criticism for its treatment of minorities and its ties to Russia. Despite these concerns, President Joe Biden is ready to welcome Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the White House.
Many Americans question why Biden would be willing to overlook Modi's human rights record and Russia ties. After all, America claims to stand for democracy and freedom. This begs the question: what message is Biden sending by feting Modi?

Unfortunately, his attempts to ease concerns and enhance relations were unsuccessful. Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared to have shown a stand-offish attitude towards Blinken during their talks, and there were no signs from both countries on a way forward to resolve the issues.
The US State Department's own website shows the Biden administration's efforts on the China front as an attempt to balance ""competition with cooperation."" Maintaining the world's largest economy and a historic political power, the US has always seen China as a key player in the global economic order. Policy analysts have repeatedly stressed that the country has to balance important, yet competing interests that lie on either side of ideological and diplomatic fences. For instance,

The locals were struggling to make ends meet and were constantly at odds with each other. However, one day a group of volunteers from India and the US came to the village and started working with the locals to improve their conditions. They worked together to build schools, hospitals, and roads, and also organized various community activities to promote unity and cooperation. Over time, the village transformed into a prosperous and peaceful community, thanks to the collaboration between India, US, and Nepal.
One of the most successful collaborations between India, US, and Nepal has been the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project, a joint venture to build a hydroelectric dam on the Mahakali River. The project not only generates clean energy but also provides irrigation, flood control, and navigation benefits. It is expected to create employment opportunities, boost the economy, and strengthen the relationship between the three countries.

This might seem like an odd collaboration, but it makes sense considering the current economic and political situation in Pakistan.
Pakistan has been facing severe energy shortages for many years, which has led to a lack of electricity in many parts of the country, especially in rural areas. In addition, the country's economy has been struggling due to external debt and low exports. China, on the other hand, has been investing heavily in Pakistan's infrastructure under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project, which is part of its Belt and Road Initiative. As part of this initiative, China is helping Pakistan set up multiple energy projects, including nuclear power plants.

Sajid Mir is believed to be one of the masterminds behind the attacks. Despite this, China has used its veto power to block a proposal to add him to the UN's list of designated terrorists, which would have led to his assets being frozen and a travel ban being imposed on him.

However, the price rally slowed down in June as buyers held back, waiting for the prices to stabilise before making any major purchases.
The story of China's lithium price rally can be traced back to the early 2000s when China began investing heavily in renewable energy sources. The country's ambitious goal was to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels and create a greener environment for its citizens.

As the effects of climate change become increasingly apparent, one of the most pressing concerns is the displacement of populations. In South Asia, where millions of people are already vulnerable to environmental disasters, the impact of climate change threatens to push even more people into poverty and instability. India, as one of the largest and most populous countries in the region, has both a responsibility and an opportunity to take action to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change.
Imagine you are a farmer in rural India. For generations, your family has relied on the monsoon rains to water your crops and provide a livelihood for your community. But in recent years, the rains have become increasingly unpredictable. Some years, there is too much rain and your crops are washed away in floods. Other years, there is not enough rain and your crops wither and die.

In today's world, businesses need to be prepared for unforeseen circumstances, and this is especially true for companies with a presence in China. The country's political and economic situation can be volatile at times, and even the most successful businesses can find themselves in a precarious position if they don't have a Plan B.
In 2005, Google made its first foray into the Chinese market with a localized version of its search engine. However, the company soon realized that in order to operate in China, it would have to comply with the country's strict censorship laws. Google was caught between a rock and a hard place: comply with China's laws and compromise its core values, or risk losing out on a huge market.

However, things started to change when a young man from the village discovered the power of the internet. He learned how to build websites and started to sell handmade products from his village online. Now, the village is a thriving hub for e-commerce, and the people have access to a whole new world of opportunities.
In recent years, Nepal has seen a significant increase in digital penetration. Today, Nepal has over 37 million mobile phone users, and the internet penetration rate has reached 18.47%.

On a sunny afternoon, Mr. Ahmed, owner of a small trucking company in Islamabad, received a call from one of his regular clients - a local petrol pump owner. The petrol pump owner had received a new supply of diesel which he claimed was of higher quality than the usual diesel he gets from the local refinery. He offered to sell the diesel at a discounted rate to Mr. Ahmed if he was willing to buy in bulk. Mr. Ahmed agreed, and the next day his trucks were filled with the discounted diesel.
Little did Mr. Ahmed know that the diesel he had purchased was not locally produced, but rather imported from Russia by the Pakistani government. In a recent development, Pakistan has been importing oil from Russia at a discounted rate, thanks to the good relations between the two countries. However, the twist in the story is that the oil is not being refined in Pakistan, but rather in India's Gujarat. This phenomenon has caught the attention of the global energy industry, and this article will explore it in more detail.

However, as he saw the pollution levels rising around him, he started wondering if he could do his part in reducing it. He decided to look up the options available in the market.
As he did his research, he realized that the world was moving towards electric vehicles at a rapid pace. Countries like China, Europe, and the United States had set ambitious targets for the adoption of electric vehicles, with India not far behind.

Global technological standards and geopolitics impact numerous industries, from telecommunications to healthcare. For example, the 5G network is a widely discussed topic due to its impact on national security and economic competitiveness. Countries such as the United States and China are in a race to develop and implement 5G technology, but they have differing opinions on network security and privacy protocols.

The Indian media has been under the radar for quite some time for its biased approach towards airing news when it comes to China and Pakistan. In recent years, the anti-China and anti-Pakistan hysteria has increased in the Indian media. A deeper analysis can reveal that there is more to this than what meets the eye. The Indian media has been observed to fabricate think tanks and buy off certain journalists to churn out news that has pro-India and anti-China, Pakistan narratives.
The Indian media is known to create and fund think tanks to justify their anti-China and anti-Pakistan rhetoric. One of the biggest examples of such a case is the Observer Research Foundation (ORF). The ORF is one such think tank that is closely associated with the Indian government, and it is known to fabricate news pieces against China and Pakistan. The ORF has been observed to have floated several news pieces that are not based on facts, but rather misinformation to support India's political and military interests.

India has always been a land of diversity, and the story of its relationship with other countries is no different. Back in the days of ancient India, three kingdoms emerged as the most powerful - Magadha, Kosala, and Vatsa. They were constantly fighting for power and control over other smaller kingdoms, each trying to establish their supremacy over the other. Fast forward to the present day, and we see similar dynamics in the global power structure, with India being one of the key players. In this article, we will be examining where India stands in the global power dynamics vis-a-vis the US, Russia, and China.
India's position in the global power hierarchy can be analyzed based on various economic, military, and political factors. Here are a few examples:

On the night of September 29, 2016, the Indian Army conducted a series of surgical strikes across the Line of Control (LoC) in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The operation was in response to a terrorist attack on an Indian Army camp in Uri that claimed the lives of 19 soldiers. The Indian strike led to a momentous situation between India and Pakistan, with both countries being nuclear powers. During that time, the Indian forces used some of the most advanced weapons systems available, such as drones, precision-guided munitions, and other electronic warfare equipment, to conduct the surgical strike successfully.
The event is an example of India's continuous effort to modernize its military and weaponry. It is also an example of the country's recent push for greater cooperation with the United States in the military-industrial sector. India and the United States have had a tumultuous relationship throughout history, with disputes ranging from trade, nuclear arms, and human rights. However, in recent years, the situation has changed, and both countries are making an effort to strengthen their partnership.

In India, traditional medicine has always been a part of people's lives. For centuries, Indians have relied on ancient healing practices like Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Unani, and Siddha to treat ailments and illnesses. These alternative healthcare systems, rooted in Indian philosophy and culture, are now making a comeback in the country's healthcare landscape.
With the rising cost of modern medicine and concerns around side effects and dependency, Indians are turning to age-old medicine for their healthcare needs. Traditional medicine is also gaining recognition from the Indian government, which has begun promoting and supporting the use of these systems.

It was a hot summer day in Mumbai. Traffic was at its peak, and people were rushing to get to their workplaces. Suddenly, a loud explosion shook the city, shattering windows, and causing panic among the people. It was a terrorist attack. A group of militants had targeted a crowded market, killing dozens of innocent civilians and injuring many more.
The attack sent shockwaves across the nation. The government was quick to condemn the act and promised to take strict action against the perpetrators. But the incident raised questions about the stability of the country and its ability to respond to such threats. The US, a key partner of India, was watching closely, assessing whether India could be a reliable partner in the fight against terrorism.

India, the world's largest democracy, is increasingly showing signs of authoritarianism under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). This erosion of democracy has serious implications not only for India but also for its allies around the world. In this article, we will explore the worrying trend of India's worsening democracy and its impact on its role as a reliable ally.
In 2020, India witnessed massive protests by farmers against three farm laws passed by the BJP government. The laws were aimed at liberalizing the agricultural sector and allowing private players to operate in it. However, farmers feared that this would lead to the end of government support and exploitation by corporations.

Since the opening of the first Chinese overseas military base in Djibouti in 2017, China has been establishing its presence in the world's oceans. The country's growing economic, military, and political power has raised important questions about its impact on the global oceans regime. Will China help shape international efforts to protect the oceans, or will it pursue its own interests at the expense of global cooperation?
China is the world's largest consumer of seafood, and the Chinese government has made efforts to expand its fishing industry by subsidizing fishing fleets and granting tax exemptions to seafood processing companies. This has resulted in overfishing and illegal fishing practices, which threaten the health of the oceans and marine wildlife.

To address this challenge, Ma's trusted lieutenants are returning to the company to oversee a tough reboot of Alibaba.
Alibaba is facing several challenges that have contributed to its decline in the Chinese market. One such example is the rise of short video platforms like Douyin and Kuaishou, which have preferences that differ from traditional e-commerce platforms like Alibaba. Another challenge is the increasing scrutiny from regulators on the company's business practices.

On December 16, 2020, the European Commission released a new strategy paper titled ""EU-China: A Strategic Outlook"" which aims to de-risk the EU's relationship with China. The paper acknowledges China's growing global influence and economic power, but also highlights the need for the EU to protect its own interests and values.

The India-Pakistan rivalry is not just limited to cricket. It is a reflection of the deep-rooted historical, political, and cultural differences that exist between the two nations. Nevertheless, cricket has been the one platform where the fans can channel their passion and emotions in a manner that is both respectful and entertaining. It has helped bring people closer, and for a brief moment, forget about their troubles.

One possible explanation is the growing strategic importance of India in global politics. With China rising as a formidable rival, the United States sees India as a potential ally in containing its influence. This has led to a trend of ""decoupling"" between the US and China, where American businesses are encouraged to move their supply chains from China to India. In this context, America cannot afford to alienate India's leader, no matter how controversial he may be.

As the world is becoming more multipolar, traditional alliances and partnerships are being reshaped. One such example is the recent rapprochement between Pakistan and Russia, two countries that have a complex history and have been on opposite sides of various geopolitical conflicts during the Cold War and afterwards. However, the changing regional and global dynamics have led to a convergence of interests between the two countries, which are now seeking to expand their bilateral ties and diversify their cooperation in various areas such as trade, investment, and defense.
The normalization of Pakistan-Russia relations can be traced back to 2014, when Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Pakistan for the first time in 10 years, and announced his country's support for Pakistan's bid to become a full member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). This gesture was seen as a signal of a shift in Russia's policy towards South Asia, which was previously dominated by its ties with India.

His party, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), won a majority of seats in the National Assembly. However, Khan's victory was marred by allegations of election rigging. Opponents accused the military of backing Khan and manipulating the results in his favor.
Since then, Khan's government has faced opposition from various quarters. The military, opposition parties, and civil society have all criticized his policies and governance style. Khan's relations with the military, in particular, have been closely watched. Despite his past criticism of the army's intervention in politics, Khan has been accused of being too close to the military establishment and not doing enough to curb its influence.

India's national airline, Air India, placed the order with Boeing and Airbus for 150 aircraft each, worth a whopping $30 billion. The purchase includes 100 narrow-body jets, 75 wide-body jets, and 125 aircraft fitted with the new fuel-efficient engines, marking a significant step up from Air India's current fleet of around 160 planes. Through this high-value order, India aims to boost its aviation industry and promote regional connectivity.

However, the government implemented a tool called the Jan Dhan Yojana, which allowed citizens to open bank accounts with no minimum balance required. This moved millions of people who had never banked before into banks.

India and Pakistan are two neighboring countries that were born out of the same region in 1947. Despite that, the two countries have taken different paths in terms of economy, culture, politics, and society. As a result, the world can see stark differences between India and Pakistan today.
The story of India and Pakistan stretches back to the time of British colonial rule. After nearly 200 years of British presence, India was a nation with diverse cultures, religions, and languages. However, the British divided India into two parts – India and Pakistan – based on religious lines. The decision led to mass migrations, communal riots, and violence. Millions of people lost their lives or were displaced.

Once upon a time, in a far-off village in India, there lived two brothers. One was a farmer, and the other was a sailor. The farmer envied his brother for being able to travel the world and see new things, while the sailor envied his brother for being able to put down roots and build a life in one place. One day, they decided to switch places, and the farmer became a sailor while the sailor became a farmer. They soon discovered that the grass isn't always greener on the other side, and that what one person sees as a benefit, another may see as a drawback. This story illustrates the complex nature of geopolitical relations in the Indo-Pacific region, where different nations have different goals, values, and interests.
The Indo-Pacific region is one of the most dynamic and diverse regions in the world, encompassing countries as diverse as India, China, Korea, Japan, Australia, and the United States. It is also one of the most strategically important regions, with key trade routes, natural resources, and military bases. The region is currently undergoing a major shift in power dynamics, with the rise of China challenging the traditional hegemony of the United States. China's Belt and Road Initiative, for example, has been described as a ""new era of colonialism"" by some critics, while others see it as an opportunity for economic growth and cooperation.

Once upon a time, there lived a country named Pakistan. It was a land of natural beauty, rich culture, and hospitable people. However, the country was grappling with economic challenges for a long time, and the situation worsened as time passed.
Things came to a head when Pakistan has been facing a stalemate with IMF talks, where the country wants flexible terms and the IMF wants strict conditions to be met.

In Kenya, there is a Maasai tribe boy named Lekishon. He is the first person in his family to attend school and is determined to become a doctor so he can help his community. Lekishon's story is an example of the potential within Africa. The continent has been long perceived as a lost cause plagued with war, poverty, and disease. However, this narrative is changing with Africa's recent economic revival that has been drawing the attention of countries such as India.
India's Foreign Minister, S Jaishankar, highlighted Africa's exciting potential and integral role in geopolitical rebalancing during his address at the Confederation of Indian Industry's (CII) 2021 Annual Session. Jaishankar outlined four factors that are responsible for Africa's rise in the world.

A 24-year-old social media star, Hu Jiaqi, had a high-paying job in marketing in Shanghai. But instead of continuing in her already successful career, she decided to become a lowly barista. She took a 70% pay cut to work at a small neighborhood coffee shop, and never looked back. Soon after, her story went viral on Chinese social media platform Weibo.
Jiaqi is just one example of a growing trend of young people in China leaving their desk-bound jobs to pursue a career as a coffee barista. According to a report by the China Coffee Association, the coffee market in China is expected to grow by over 30% annually, with the number of coffee shops reaching over 60,000 by the end of 2025. This presents a huge opportunity for young people who want to pursue a career in coffee, and many are seizing this opportunity with both hands.

Picture this: a world in which all of our current encryption methods and security measures are as easy to crack as a simple password. Hackers and cyber criminals alike would have access to all of our most personal information – bank accounts, social security numbers, medical records, and more – leaving those affected with little to no recourse.
This might sound like a dystopian future, but it could become a reality with the advent of quantum computing. Quantum computing is the development of computer technology based on the principles of quantum theory, which explains the behavior of energy and matter on the atomic and subatomic level. This new computing paradigm has the potential to dramatically speed up computations, which could have a profound impact on cybersecurity.

In the world of finance, international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) often hold significant power, especially over developing countries. However, this power dynamic has been recently brought to light as Pakistan's finance minister, Asad Umar, criticized the IMF for its treatment of his country.
Pakistan recently secured another bailout package from the IMF, worth $6 billion. However, the conditions attached to this bailout have been met with criticism from Pakistan's finance minister. Asad Umar stated that the IMF's demands were ""totally unfair"" and that the organization has a history of imposing harsh terms on Pakistan.

Once upon a time, there were two giants competing for dominance in the international arena - the United States and China. However, a third player has emerged, hoping to take its place in the global stage. This player is India, a rapidly growing economy that has caught the attention and interest of both the US and China.
The US has claimed that the upcoming state visit of Indian Premier Narendra Modi is not about China. However, it's hard not to think that China is not at the back of the US' mind when it comes to boosting relations with India. India has much to offer the US - a strong democracy, a large population, and a young labor force. For the US, having India as an ally strengthens its position in the Asia-Pacific region, and provides a counterbalance to China's growing influence.

In September 2019, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the United States for the second time in three years. During his visit, he was welcomed with open arms by US politicians and business leaders. However, many activists and human rights groups expressed concern over Modi's record on human rights, particularly regarding India's Muslim minority. Despite these concerns, the US government chose to welcome Modi and strengthen their ties with India.
Modi's government has been accused of suppressing dissent and free speech, with many journalists and activists being detained or charged under the controversial Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. In addition, his government revoked the autonomy of the Muslim-majority region of Kashmir, leading to a crackdown on protests and an internet blackout. Many fear that Modi's government is promoting an increasingly Hindu nationalist agenda at the expense of minority groups.

As the world is growing more interconnected, geopolitical issues have become a concern for many countries. Kazakhstan, a Central Asian country, is no exception. While the country has made significant strides in its economic development and international relations, it faces numerous challenges on the geopolitical front. Kazakhstan, which is the world's largest landlocked country, shares borders with Russia, China, and several other countries. Due to its strategic location and abundant natural resources, the country is considered a key player in the region. Hence, many Western pundits are offering their advice on Kazakh geopolitics.
In 2019, the Kazakh government faced a major challenge when it had to deal with a protest against its proposed land reform. The protest, which was held in the capital city of Nur-Sultan, was one of the largest in the country's history. The government had proposed to amend the land code to allow foreigners to lease land for up to 25 years, which many Kazakhs feared would lead to a loss of their valuable agricultural land. The protests highlighted the growing disillusionment among the country's citizens and the need for more inclusive policymaking.

Investing in the right place and at the right time can make you a fortune - and history is filled with such examples of mega-successful investments. However, sometimes, people tend to shift their attention away from what's productive and profitable and instead try to protect what they already have. That's when things start to take an interesting turn.
Take, for instance, the story of a small town businessman who started a small firm manufacturing umbrellas. The firm was doing well, and he had customers all over his country. However, he became incredibly protective and refused investments from foreign investors, especially from China, citing reasons like interest rates, export control regulations, and most importantly, the assumption that wave after wave of Chinese investment would create a monopoly in the market. After years of sheer reliance on domestic funds, he ended up going out of business, as he failed to compete with rivals who had availed foreign investments and expanded their businesses abroad.

The Pakistan cricket team has requested the International Cricket Council (ICC) to swap the venues for their 2021 T20 World Cup matches against Australia and Afghanistan. According to Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), the team management has asked for the adjustment due to ""challenging travelling"" and ""bio-secure environment fatigue"".
The request has been made after Pakistan's recent tours to England and West Indies, where the team had to stay in strict bio-secure bubbles due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The players and officials have expressed concerns about the toll of such bubbles, which restrict movements and interactions with the outside world.

It was a cold winter night in 2014 when Ivan, a Ukrainian soldier, received an urgent message from his commander. He was stationed at a border checkpoint near the city of Luhansk, which had become a hotbed of separatist activity. The message was clear: The enemy was coming, and they were heavily armed.
Ivan and his fellow soldiers were already on high alert. The situation had been tense for weeks, with reports of Russian troops and weapons flooding into Ukraine. But this was different. This time, there was a sense of desperation in the air. Ivan knew that he and his comrades were about to face one of the toughest battles of their lives.
