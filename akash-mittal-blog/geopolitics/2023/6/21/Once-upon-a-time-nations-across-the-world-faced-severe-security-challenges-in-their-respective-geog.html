  <p></p>
  <p>The Wassenaar Arrangement is a group of 42 countries aimed at promoting responsibility and transparency in the trade of conventional arms and dual-use goods and technologies. India assumed the chairmanship of the Wassenaar arrangement for 2018 and organized the technical briefing for outreach nations, primarily focusing on the changes made in export control across various nation-states. The technical briefing featured presentations and discussions on various topics, including industry outreach, Wassenaar fundamental principles, and human capacity building.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>India's hosting the technical briefing displays its growing role in promoting global security and defense. India, as a rapidly developing nation, has increased its defense spending and research capabilities over the past few years. This case suggests that India's active participation in the Wassenaar Arrangement reflects its willingness to collaborate with other nations on various security and defense-related aspects.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One such example was reported in 2019 when a group of Indian hackers breached the Pakistani government's top security apparatus â€“ the National Telecom and Information Technology Security Board (NTISB). The Indian hacker association called "The Mallu Cyber Soldiers" took responsibility by uploading a video on YouTube, highlighting the security loopholes in the NTISB system. The incident not only showcased India's technical expertise but also the importance of collaboration among nations to counter such cyber threats.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In another case, the Government of India and the Netherlands jointly launched the "Wassenaar Arrangement- India Cooperation Program on Nuclear Safety, Security, and Non-Proliferation." This five-year-long program aims to enhance India's nuclear safety and security measures while also developing India's capacity to deal with challenges related to nuclear safety.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. International collaboration: India's hosting of the technical briefing emphasizes the importance of international collaboration in different areas such as security, defense and technology.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Defense and security: India's involvement in the Wassenaar arrangement highlights its growing role in the global defense and security community.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Technical expertise: India's technical expertise in the field of cyber security is a crucial asset that could potentially allow it to connect with other nations to solve issues related to cyber security threats.</p>
