    <p>In a move that has raised eyebrows in Beijing, India has gifted a warship to Vietnam as a part of its plan to expand its footprint in the South China Sea. The warship will be used by Vietnam to patrol its waters and protect its interests in the disputed region.</p>
    <h2>India's Growing Interest in the South China Sea</h2>
    <p>The South China Sea has been a contentious region for several years now, with multiple countries laying claim to its waters. China, in particular, has been more aggressive in its approach, building artificial islands and militarizing the region. This has caused concern among other countries, including India, which has a growing interest in the area.</p>
    <p>India sees the South China Sea as a crucial region for its own strategic and economic interests. The Indian Ocean, which is close to the South China Sea, is a key route for India's trade and energy supplies. India also has oil exploration projects in the region.</p>
    <p>By expanding its footprint in the South China Sea, India hopes to counterbalance China's growing influence and ensure that its own interests are protected. India has been increasing its engagement with other countries in the region, including Vietnam, which has been a vocal opponent of China's territorial claims.</p>
    <h2>Examples of India's Engagement in the South China Sea</h2>
    <p>India's engagement in the South China Sea has been multi-pronged, including diplomatic as well as military measures. Here are some examples of India's growing presence in the region:</p>
    <h3>Bilateral Agreements with Other Countries</h3>
    <p>India has been signing bilateral agreements with other countries in the region to counter China's increasing influence. In 2018, India signed a naval cooperation agreement with Vietnam, which included training, capacity building and exchange of information. India has also signed agreements with other countries in the region, including Indonesia, Japan, and Malaysia.</p>
    <h3>Joint Military Exercises</h3>
    <p>India has been conducting joint military exercises with other countries in the region, including the United States, Japan, and Australia. In 2020, India and Australia conducted their first-ever naval exercise, which focused on anti-submarine warfare and other maritime operations. India has also conducted joint exercises with Vietnam and Indonesia.</p>
    <h3>Infrastructure Development Projects</h3>
    <p>India is also investing in infrastructure development projects in the region, including the construction of ports and other facilities. In 2018, India signed an agreement to develop the Sabang port in Indonesia, which is close to the South China Sea. India is also developing the Chabahar port in Iran, which will give it access to Afghanistan and Central Asia.</p>
    <h2>Case Study: India-Vietnam Relations</h2>
    <p>India's growing engagement with Vietnam is a key component of its strategy in the South China Sea. India and Vietnam have a long-standing relationship, dating back to the Cold War era. However, their ties have grown stronger in recent years, especially in the area of defense cooperation.</p>
    <p>India has been a major supplier of weapons to Vietnam, including missiles and artillery. In 2016, India extended a $500 million line of credit to Vietnam for defense purchases. India has also been training Vietnamese personnel in counter-terrorism and maritime security.</p>
    <p>In 2019, a Vietnamese delegation visited India to attend the India-Vietnam Defense Industry Business Meet and Exhibition, which showcased India's defense industry capabilities. In the same year, the INS Khanjar, an Indian Navy ship, made a port call in Vietnam, signaling India's growing presence in the region.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion: India's Strategy in Three Points</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>Expanding engagement with other countries in the region to counterbalance China's growing influence</li>
     <li>Increasing military presence and joint exercises to ensure its own strategic and economic interests are protected</li>
     <li>Investing in infrastructure development projects to strengthen its economic ties with the region and gain access to key strategic locations</li>
    </ol>
