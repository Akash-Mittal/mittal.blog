     <p>In 2018, Imran Khan became the Prime Minister of Pakistan after winning the country's general elections. His party, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), won a majority of seats in the National Assembly. However, Khan's victory was marred by allegations of election rigging. Opponents accused the military of backing Khan and manipulating the results in his favor.</p>
     <p>Since then, Khan's government has faced opposition from various quarters. The military, opposition parties, and civil society have all criticized his policies and governance style. Khan's relations with the military, in particular, have been closely watched. Despite his past criticism of the army's intervention in politics, Khan has been accused of being too close to the military establishment and not doing enough to curb its influence.</p>

     <h2>Examples</h2>
     <p>One of the main reasons for the threat of a military trial against Khan is the ongoing protests by the opposition parties. In recent months, the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), a coalition of opposition parties, has held rallies and sit-ins across the country to demand Khan's resignation. The PDM has accused Khan of being a puppet of the military and of stealing the 2018 elections. They have also criticized his government's economic policies and human rights record.</p>
     <p>The military has been accused of supporting the PDM's protests and trying to engineer Khan's ouster. Some analysts believe that the military is unhappy with Khan's attempts to assert his authority and pursue a more independent foreign policy. They argue that the military wants a more pliant Prime Minister who will follow its lead and not challenge its dominance in Pakistani politics.</p>
     <p>Another example of the tension between Khan and the military is the government's handling of the case of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Sharif, who was ousted from power in 2017, was convicted of corruption and sentenced to prison. However, he was allowed to go to London for medical treatment and has not returned to Pakistan since. Khan's government has tried to bring Sharif back to face justice, but the military has been accused of thwarting its efforts. Some analysts believe that the military is protecting Sharif because he is seen as a rival to Khan and a potential alternative to lead the country.</p>

     <h2>Case Studies</h2>
     <h3>Benazir Bhutto</h3>
     <p>The threat of a military trial against Imran Khan is not without precedent in Pakistan's history. In 1990, the military government of General Pervez Musharraf charged Benazir Bhutto, the Prime Minister at the time, with corruption. Bhutto was eventually forced out of office and went into exile. She returned to Pakistan in 2007 and was assassinated while campaigning for elections.</p>
     <h3>Nawaz Sharif</h3>
     <p>Nawaz Sharif, who has already been mentioned in this article, has also faced multiple trials on charges of corruption and money laundering. In 2017, he was disqualified from holding public office for life by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Sharif has accused the military of engineering his downfall and trying to prevent him from returning to power. His party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), has also accused Khan's government of being a puppet of the military.</p>
