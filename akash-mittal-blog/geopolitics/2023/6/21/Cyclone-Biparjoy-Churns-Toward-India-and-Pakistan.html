    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>It was a sunny day in Mumbai when news of Cyclone Biparjoy started making rounds. The city had barely recovered from the last natural disaster it had faced, when another one was looming large. The news reminded me of my childhood days, when my grandparents would narrate stories of the 1971 cyclone that had hit the eastern coast of India, killing thousands of people. I realized that history was repeating itself, and it was my generation's turn to face the wrath of nature.</p>

   <section id="examples">
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>Cyclone Biparjoy is a Category 5 storm, with wind speeds of up to 230 km/h. It is expected to hit the coasts of India and Pakistan in the next few days, and is expected to cause massive destruction. The storm surge could reach up to 12 feet, which could cause flooding in low-lying areas. Homes and infrastructure could be destroyed, and millions of people could be left homeless.</p>
    <p>This is not the first time that India and Pakistan have faced natural disasters of this scale. In the recent past, both countries have faced floods, earthquakes, and cyclones, with devastating consequences. The 2005 earthquake in Pakistan left over 73,000 people dead, and the 2013 Uttarakhand floods in India killed over 5,700 people. The governments of both countries have been criticized for their lack of preparedness and response to these disasters.</p>

    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>One of the worst natural disasters in recent history was the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. The tsunami, triggered by the earthquake, killed over 230,000 people in 14 countries. The lack of a warning system and preparedness in the affected countries was widely criticized. In response, the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System was established, which is now operational in the region.</p>
    <p>Another example of the impact of natural disasters on people's lives is the 2018 Kerala floods. The floods, caused by heavy rainfall, killed over 400 people and left over a million people homeless. The state of Kerala had to rely on the support of neighboring states and international aid to cope with the disaster.</p>

   <section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Cyclone Biparjoy is yet another reminder of the devastating impact that natural disasters can have on people's lives. It is important for governments to be prepared and have measures in place to minimize the damage caused by these disasters. The following are three key takeaways from this situation:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Investment in disaster warning systems and preparedness measures is crucial to saving lives.</li>
     <li>The impact of natural disasters can disproportionately affect vulnerable communities, and efforts should be made to ensure their safety and wellbeing.</li>
     <li>International cooperation and support can be crucial in times of disaster, and countries should be ready to offer aid to those in need.</li>
    </ol>
