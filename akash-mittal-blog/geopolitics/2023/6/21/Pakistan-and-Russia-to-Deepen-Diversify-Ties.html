  <h1>An Unlikely Partnership: Pakistan and Russia to Deepen, Diversify Ties</h1></br> <img src="images/Pakistan-and-Russia-to-Deepen-Diversify-Ties.jpeg" alt="+Pakistan-and-Russia-to-Deepen-Diversify-Ties+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2422715/pakistan-russia-to-deepen-diversify-ties" target="_blank" href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2422715/pakistan-russia-to-deepen-diversify-ties" rel="noopener">https://tribune.com.pk/story/2422715/pakistan-russia-to-deepen-diversify-ties</a></span></h5>
  <p>As the world is becoming more multipolar, traditional alliances and partnerships are being reshaped. One such example is the recent rapprochement between Pakistan and Russia, two countries that have a complex history and have been on opposite sides of various geopolitical conflicts during the Cold War and afterwards. However, the changing regional and global dynamics have led to a convergence of interests between the two countries, which are now seeking to expand their bilateral ties and diversify their cooperation in various areas such as trade, investment, and defense.</p>
  <h2>The Road to Normalization</h2>
  <p>The normalization of Pakistan-Russia relations can be traced back to 2014, when Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Pakistan for the first time in 10 years, and announced his country's support for Pakistan's bid to become a full member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). This gesture was seen as a signal of a shift in Russia's policy towards South Asia, which was previously dominated by its ties with India.</p>
  <p>Since then, Pakistan and Russia have engaged in a series of high-level visits, meetings, and joint exercises, which have helped to build mutual trust and understanding. For instance, in 2016, the two countries held their first-ever joint military exercise, code-named Druzhba-2016, which involved the Russian army's special forces and the Pakistani army's SSG. This exercise was a landmark event, as it marked the first time that Russian troops were deployed on Pakistani soil since World War II.</p>
  <h2>Expanding Cooperation</h2>
  <p>The deepening of Pakistan-Russia relations is not just limited to the defense sector, but has also expanded to other areas such as energy, trade, and investment. For instance, Russia has expressed interest in investing in Pakistan's energy and infrastructure projects, such as the North-South Gas Pipeline and the Karachi-Lahore Motorway. Similarly, Pakistan is keen to increase its exports to Russia, particularly in the agricultural and textile sectors.</p>
  <p>In addition, both countries are exploring the potential for enhancing their cooperation in the areas of science, technology, and education. For example, the Russian Federation of Cosmonautics has offered to train Pakistani astronauts, while Russia's top universities are also keen to collaborate with Pakistani universities to promote academic exchanges and joint research projects.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <h3>Pakistan and Russia's Collaboration in the Defense Sector</h3>
  <p>Pakistan and Russia's defense ties have been central to their growing partnership. In recent years, Pakistan has bought various military hardware from Russia, including Mi-35M attack helicopters and Klimov RD-93 engines. Moreover, the two countries are now cooperating in joint defense ventures such as the development of the Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft (FGFA), which will combine Russia's state-of-the-art Sukhoi PAK FA T-50 fighter jet technology with Pakistan's experience in developing the JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft.</p>
  <h3>Russia's Investment in Pakistan's Energy Projects</h3>
  <p>Russia has expressed interest in investing in Pakistan's energy sector, which has been struggling with a chronic energy crisis for the past decade. In particular, Russia's energy giant, Gazprom, has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Pakistan's Inter State Gas Systems (ISGS) to build the North-South Gas Pipeline, which will transport liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Karachi to Lahore. This $2 billion project is expected to be completed by 2020, and will help to reduce the country's reliance on expensive imported oil and gas.</p>
  <h3>Pakistan's Exports to Russia in the Agricultural Sector</h3>
  <p>Pakistan is keen to enhance its trade ties with Russia, and has identified agriculture as a potential area for collaboration. In particular, Pakistan is keen to export its high-quality Basmati rice to Russia, which has a growing demand for this type of rice. Pakistan's rice exports to Russia have been on the rise in recent years, and reached a record high of 54,000 tonnes in 2017. Moreover, Pakistani companies are also exploring opportunities for exporting mangoes, citrus fruits, and other agricultural products to Russia.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion: A New Chapter in Pakistan-Russia Relations</h2>
  <p>The deepening of Pakistan-Russia ties is a reflection of the changing geopolitical landscape, where countries are seeking to diversify their partnerships and explore new areas of cooperation. Pakistan and Russia's growing partnership is based on a shared interest in promoting regional stability, combating terrorism, and enhancing economic connectivity. However, there are also challenges that need to be addressed, such as the trust deficit between the two countries due to their historical baggage and the need to align their policies on various regional and global issues.</p>
  <p>Despite these challenges, Pakistan and Russia are determined to build a strong and sustainable strategic partnership that can contribute to the prosperity and security of their respective countries. The key takeaway from this evolving relationship is that even erstwhile foes can become friends if they are willing to overcome their differences and pursue common objectives.</p>
