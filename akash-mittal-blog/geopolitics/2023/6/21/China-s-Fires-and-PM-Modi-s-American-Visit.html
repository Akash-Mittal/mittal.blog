     <p>On September 14, 2021, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in the United States for a series of meetings with American officials, including President Joe Biden. However, Modi's visit came at a difficult time for both India and the US as China faced a series of devastating wildfires that continued to burn for weeks. The fires, which started on September 6, 2021, and grew to cover more than 22,000 acres, killed at least one person, threatened homes and businesses, and forced thousands of people to evacuate.</p>

     <h2>Examples of Impacts on PM Modi's Visit</h2>
     <p>During his visit, Modi expressed his condolences to the Chinese people and offered assistance in combating the fires. However, the fires had a direct impact on his schedule. For example, his planned visit to Ground Zero in New York City to pay respects to the victims of the September 11 attacks was canceled due to the ongoing firefighting efforts.</p>
     <p>Furthermore, the wildfires overshadowed other issues that Modi and Biden were expected to discuss, such as the ongoing security situation in Afghanistan and India's concerns about China's growing influence in the region.</p>

     <h2>Case Studies on India-US Relations</h2>
     <ul>
      <li><strong>The Quad:</strong> The Quad, a strategic alliance consisting of the US, India, Japan, and Australia, has been seen as an important tool for balancing China's influence in the region. However, some critics have argued that the US has only paid "lip service" to India's role in the alliance, and that India is often seen as a junior partner to the US.</li>
      <li><strong>The Trade Relationship:</strong> India and the US have had a complex trade relationship, with disputes over tariffs and intellectual property rights. Critics have argued that the US has been too aggressive in pushing its interests on issues such as the price of drugs and access to Indian markets, while not doing enough to support India's own economic development.</li>
      <li><strong>The Technology Sector:</strong> Both India and the US have growing tech sectors, with India being home to a number of major tech firms. However, concerns have been raised about the US's use of technology to gain an advantage over its allies. For example, India has been hesitant to join the Clean Network initiative, which seeks to exclude Chinese technology companies from participating in 5G networks, over concerns that it will be used to promote US companies at the expense of Indian ones.</li>
