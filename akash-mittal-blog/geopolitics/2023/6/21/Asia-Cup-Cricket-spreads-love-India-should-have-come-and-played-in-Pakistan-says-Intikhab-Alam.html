  <h1>Asia Cup: ‘Cricket spreads love' India should have come and played in Pakistan, says Intikhab Alam</h1></br> <img src="images/Asia-Cup-Cricket-spreads-love-India-should-have-come-and-played-in-Pakistan-says-Intikhab-Alam.jpeg" alt="+Asia-Cup-Cricket-spreads-love-India-should-have-come-and-played-in-Pakistan-says-Intikhab-Alam+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-cricket-spreads-love-india-should-have-come-and-played-in-pakistan-says-intikhab-alam-8675579/" target="_blank" href="https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-cricket-spreads-love-india-should-have-come-and-played-in-pakistan-says-intikhab-alam-8675579/" rel="noopener">https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-cricket-spreads-love-india-should-have-come-and-played-in-pakistan-says-intikhab-alam-8675579/</a></span></h5>
  <p>Cricketers may be rivals on the field, but off the field, they share a special bond that transcends boundaries. The Asia Cup, the premier cricket tournament for the Asian countries, exemplifies this bond. The tournament, which started in 1984, has brought together the best cricketers from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and other countries in the region every two years.</p>
  <p>Despite the fierce competition between the teams, the Asia Cup has always been a celebration of cricket and camaraderie. The players have often exchanged high-fives and hugs, congratulating each other after a well-fought match. The fans, too, have come together to support their favorite teams, irrespective of their nationalities.</p>
  <h2>Cricket Spreads Love</h2>
  <p>Cricket, as a sport, has always had the power to unite people, especially in the Asian region. In the 1980s, when India and Pakistan were going through a rough patch in their bilateral relations, cricket provided the much-needed respite. The two countries played the historic series of 1987, which not only brought cricket back to the forefront but also gave a boost to the peace process between the two nations.</p>
  <p>Similarly, in 2004, when India toured Pakistan for a cricket series after a long hiatus, it brought joy and hope to both countries. Pakistan won the Test series, but the real winners were the people of both countries, who got a glimpse of how cricket can bring people together.</p>
  <h2>India-Pakistan Cricket Rivalry</h2>
  <p>However, the India-Pakistan cricket rivalry has not always been peaceful. The two nations have fought three major wars since their independence in 1947, and the tension between them spills over to cricket as well. The matches between India and Pakistan are often highly charged and emotional, with the players and fans on both sides giving their all to win.</p>
  <p>The rivalry reached its peak during the 2019 World Cup when India and Pakistan met in the group stage match. The match was played at the Old Trafford cricket ground in Manchester, England, and it was expected to be a high-voltage affair. However, India dominated the match, winning by 89 runs via DLS method. The result was a huge disappointment for the Pakistani fans, who were hoping for a miracle.</p>
  <h2>India's Decision to Boycott Asia Cup</h2>
  <p>India's decision to boycott the Asia Cup, scheduled to be held in Pakistan in 2022, has stirred up a controversy. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) cited security concerns as the reason for its decision. This decision has disappointed cricket fans in Pakistan, who were looking forward to hosting the tournament.</p>
  <p>Intikhab Alam, the former Pakistani cricketer, and coach believe that cricket can play a vital role in promoting peace and love between the two countries. In an interview, he said, "Cricket should be above everything," he said. "I feel India should have come and played in Pakistan. It would have been a wonderful occasion because cricket is a sport that spreads love."</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <h3>Peace through Cricket</h3>
  <p>One of the best examples of how cricket can be used as a tool for promoting peace is the ‘Peace through Cricket' initiative. Started by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) in 2012, the initiative aims to promote peace and harmony by using cricket as a platform. Under this initiative, the PCB invites teams from various countries to play in Pakistan, providing them with top-class security. The initiative has been hugely successful in promoting Pakistan as a safe destination for cricket.</p>
  <h3>Economic Benefits of Hosting Cricket Tournaments</h3>
  <p>Cricket is not just a sport; it is a significant contributor to the economy of the country that hosts the tournament. The Asia Cup 2018, held in the UAE, generated an estimated economic impact of $26.4 million, including $22.1 million in direct benefit. The tournament also created more than 600 jobs and attracted more than 17,000 tourists from various countries.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Cricket has always been an integral part of the Asian culture, and the Asia Cup is a shining example of how cricket can bring people together. The decision of the BCCI to boycott the Asia Cup is a huge setback for the cricket fans in Pakistan. Cricket should not be politicized, and the authorities should ensure that the sport is played in the right spirit. Cricket should be used as a tool for promoting peace and friendship between the nations.</p>
