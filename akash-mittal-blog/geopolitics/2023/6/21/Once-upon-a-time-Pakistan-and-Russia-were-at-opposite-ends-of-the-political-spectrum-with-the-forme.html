  <h1>Once upon a time, Pakistan and Russia were at opposite ends of the political spectrum, with the former being a staunch US ally and the latter closest to China. However, that has changed drastically over the past decade, with both countries finding common ground in their fight against terrorism. As a result of this growing relationship, Pakistan has received its "first ever" Russian oil cargo, marking a significant milestone in their partnership.</h1></br> <img src="images/Once-upon-a-time-Pakistan-and-Russia-were-at-opposite-ends-of-the-political-spectrum-with-the-forme.jpeg" alt="+Once-upon-a-time-Pakistan-and-Russia-were-at-opposite-ends-of-the-political-spectrum-with-the-forme+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30T_oG-zJTY" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30T_oG-zJTY" rel="noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30T_oG-zJTY</a></span></h5>
  <p></p>
  <p>This development comes in the wake of US sanctions against Iran, which had previously been one of Pakistan's key oil suppliers. However, with the US lifting its ban on Russia's Rosneft Trading SA, Pakistan turned to Russia for its oil needs. The tanker carrying the cargo arrived at the Port Qasim in Karachi, where it was received by Pakistan's petroleum minister, Omar Ayub Khan.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This is just one example of the deepening relationship between Pakistan and Russia. In recent years, both countries have signed a number of agreements on military cooperation, regional security, energy, and trade. For instance, Russia is building a gas pipeline from Karachi to Lahore, which is expected to provide a major boost to Pakistan's struggling energy sector. Similarly, Pakistan has shown its interest in buying Russian weapons, including helicopters, drones, and missile systems, which could reduce its dependence on the US and its allies.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>There are many reasons why Pakistan and Russia are drawn towards each other. For one, both countries are facing similar security threats, particularly from Islamist militants who are wreaking havoc in their respective regions. Pakistan is struggling to contain the spread of terrorist groups like the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, while Russia is battling insurgent groups in the North Caucasus and elsewhere. By working together, both countries can share intelligence and expertise to address these challenges.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Moreover, both countries see themselves as regional powers and want to increase their influence in the region. Pakistan is keen to play a more active role in Central Asia, where it has strategic interests, particularly in the field of energy and trade. Meanwhile, Russia has been seeking to expand its presence in South Asia, in part to counter growing Chinese influence in the region. By forging closer ties with each other, both countries can achieve their strategic goals.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>To illustrate the benefits of the Pakistan-Russia relationship, one can look at the case of the Afghan peace process. Both countries have been involved in the talks to end the long-running conflict in Afghanistan, with Russia hosting a number of meetings with the Taliban and other Afghan stakeholders. Pakistan, on the other hand, has been working with the Afghan government and other regional players to facilitate the talks. By coordinating their efforts, both countries can help bring peace and stability to Afghanistan and the wider region.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another example is the joint naval exercises that Pakistan and Russia conducted in the Arabian Sea in early 2020. The exercises, which involved ships, aircraft, and special forces personnel, were aimed at strengthening their maritime cooperation and countering terrorism and piracy. Such exercises can help enhance the capabilities of both countries' armed forces and promote regional security.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, the growing Pakistan-Russia relationship has the potential to transform the geopolitical landscape of South Asia and beyond. By working together, both countries can overcome their security challenges, boost their economies, and enhance their regional influence. As the first Russian oil cargo arrives in Pakistan, it is clear that this "new relationship" is here to stay.</p>
