  <h1>The Rise of China and its Impact on the Global Oceans Regime</h1></br> <img src="images/Is-China-Reshaping-the-Global-Oceans-Regime.jpeg" alt="+Is-China-Reshaping-the-Global-Oceans-Regime+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/06/10/china-sea-south-east-maritime-claims-law-oceans-us-disputes/" target="_blank" href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/06/10/china-sea-south-east-maritime-claims-law-oceans-us-disputes/" rel="noopener">https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/06/10/china-sea-south-east-maritime-claims-law-oceans-us-disputes/</a></span></h5>
  <p>Since the opening of the first Chinese overseas military base in Djibouti in 2017, China has been establishing its presence in the world's oceans. The country's growing economic, military, and political power has raised important questions about its impact on the global oceans regime. Will China help shape international efforts to protect the oceans, or will it pursue its own interests at the expense of global cooperation?</p>
  <h2>Examples of China's Oceans Policy</h2>
  <p>China is the world's largest consumer of seafood, and the Chinese government has made efforts to expand its fishing industry by subsidizing fishing fleets and granting tax exemptions to seafood processing companies. This has resulted in overfishing and illegal fishing practices, which threaten the health of the oceans and marine wildlife.</p>
  <p>China has also been involved in a number of disputes over territorial claims in the South China Sea, where it has built artificial islands and militarized its presence. These actions have raised tensions with other countries in the region, including Vietnam, the Philippines, and Indonesia.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies on China's Impact on the Oceans Regime</h2>
  <h3>Illegal Fishing</h3>
  <p>China's large fishing fleet has been implicated in illegal fishing practices around the world, including in South America, Africa, and Asia. In 2016, an international court ruled that China had violated international law by using illegal fishing practices in the Galapagos Islands, a UNESCO World Heritage site. In response, the Chinese government pledged to crack down on illegal fishing and to enforce international fishing regulations, but there are still concerns about the extent of these efforts.</p>
  <h3>South China Sea Disputes</h3>
  <p>China's territorial claims in the South China Sea have been a major point of contention with other countries in the region, as well as with the United States. China has built and militarized artificial islands in the Spratly Islands chain, leading to concerns about the country's intentions and potential military threats to neighboring countries.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The growing influence of China in the global oceans regime presents both opportunities and challenges. On the one hand, China has the potential to contribute to international efforts to protect the oceans and marine wildlife. On the other hand, its pursuit of economic, military, and political interests could undermine these efforts and lead to greater tensions and conflicts.</p>
  <p>Some key points to keep in mind about China's impact on the oceans regime include:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>China's growing influence in the world's oceans makes it a key player in efforts to protect marine environments and wildlife</li>
   <li>China's pursuit of economic, military, and political interests can also lead to conflicts with other countries and undermine global cooperation</li>
   <li>International efforts to protect the oceans must take into account China's role in order to be effective and sustainable</li>
  </ol>
