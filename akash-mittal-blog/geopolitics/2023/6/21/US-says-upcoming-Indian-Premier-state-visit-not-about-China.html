  <p>Once upon a time, there were two giants competing for dominance in the international arena - the United States and China. However, a third player has emerged, hoping to take its place in the global stage. This player is India, a rapidly growing economy that has caught the attention and interest of both the US and China.</p>
  <h2>Is it Really Not About China?</h2>
  <p>The US has claimed that the upcoming state visit of Indian Premier Narendra Modi is not about China. However, it's hard not to think that China is not at the back of the US' mind when it comes to boosting relations with India. India has much to offer the US - a strong democracy, a large population, and a young labor force. For the US, having India as an ally strengthens its position in the Asia-Pacific region, and provides a counterbalance to China's growing influence.</p>
  <h2>Examples of US-India Relations</h2>
  <p>The US and India have had a somewhat rocky relationship in the past, but there have been efforts to strengthen ties in recent years. In 2016, President Obama designated India as a "Major Defense Partner" of the US, allowing for greater cooperation in defense and security activities. The two countries have also signed agreements on trade and investment, and have been working together on issues such as climate change and counter-terrorism.</p>
  <h2>Case Study: The US-India Nuclear Deal</h2>
  <p>One of the most significant developments in US-India relations in recent years was the signing of the US-India Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement in 2008. The deal ended India's status as a pariah state when it came to nuclear energy, and allowed it to import nuclear technology and fuel from the US and other countries. The deal had a number of benefits for India - it enabled it to meet its growing energy needs, and gave it greater legitimacy on the global stage. For the US, the deal provided an opportunity to strengthen its ties with India, and provided a way to counterbalance China's growing influence.</p>
