  <h1>Once upon a time, a small country called India hosted a technical briefing in Vienna for 20 outreach nations as Wassenaar Arrangement plenary chair. It was a significant step towards making the world a safer place with increased Information and Communication Technology (ICT) security.</h1></br> <img src="images/Once-upon-a-time-a-small-country-called-India-hosted-a-technical-briefing-in-Vienna-for-20-outreach.jpeg" alt="+Once-upon-a-time-a-small-country-called-India-hosted-a-technical-briefing-in-Vienna-for-20-outreach+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://en.trend.az/world/3763998.html" target="_blank" href="https://en.trend.az/world/3763998.html" rel="noopener">https://en.trend.az/world/3763998.html</a></span></h5>
  <p></p>
  <p>The Indian delegation talked about various technologies that could be used for security purposes, including encryption, intrusion detection, and cybersecurity. But what is the Wassenaar Arrangement, and why is it so crucial?</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The Wassenaar Arrangement is a multilateral export control regime established in 1996 to prevent the proliferation of dual-use commodities and technologies that could be used for military purposes. The Arrangement has 42 participating states, including India. The aim is to contribute to international and regional peace and security by ensuring transparency and responsibility in transfers of such goods and technologies.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>India's leadership role as the plenary chair was crucial in hosting the briefing. The Wassenaar Arrangement is one of the most critical global export control regimes, and India's participation has only increased in recent years. India's hosting of the briefing on technical upgrades will help other countries enhance their cybersecurity and digital defense mechanisms.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Examples of India's Contribution to ICT Security</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>India is a thriving market for IT services and products, and the country's growth in the field has been remarkable. The government has been working hard to boost ICT security. Some of the steps taken by the Indian government over the years include:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. National Cyber Security Policy: The government launched the National Cyber Security Policy in 2013 to address cybersecurity concerns. The policy's primary objective was to create a secure cyber ecosystem and develop critical infrastructure in the cyber domain.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Cyber Swachhta Kendra: India launched Cyber Swachhta Kendra in 2017 to protect Indian cyberspace. The center works as an antivirus solution to remove malicious software from infected computers and devices.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Aadhaar Project: The Aadhaar project is a biometric system that has provided unique identification numbers to more than 1.2 billion people in India. It is one of the most successful projects involving ICT in India, and it has enhanced security for many digital services in the country.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case Studies on India's Leadership in ICT Security</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Kaspersky Lab Report: As per a report by Kaspersky Lab in 2018, the top ten countries that received the maximum spam emails were all outside Europe and North America. India was among the top three, and this highlights the importance of ICT security in the country.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Digital India Initiative: The Digital India initiative has gained significant momentum in the last few years. The initiative has provided more than 300,000 Common Service Centers (CSCs) that enable access to online services and helped more than 250,000 villages to access the internet. The digital initiative has enhanced transparency and enabled efficient administration and service delivery.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Cybersecurity Partnership with the US: The Indian government has been working with the US towards improving ICT security. The two countries have signed an agreement for cooperation in the field of cybersecurity. The partnership aims to enhance the collaborative efforts to tackle cyber-crime and create secure digital exchanges.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. India's leadership role as the Wassenaar Arrangement plenary chair is crucial in enhancing cybersecurity.</p>
  <p>2. India's contribution to ICT security over the years has been commendable, and the country is making significant strides towards digitalization.</p>
  <p>3. The case studies highlight India's performance in enhancing digital infrastructure and service delivery.</p>
