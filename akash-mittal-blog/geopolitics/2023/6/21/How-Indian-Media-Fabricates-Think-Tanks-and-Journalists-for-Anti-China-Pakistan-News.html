   <p>The Indian media has been under the radar for quite some time for its biased approach towards airing news when it comes to China and Pakistan. In recent years, the anti-China and anti-Pakistan hysteria has increased in the Indian media. A deeper analysis can reveal that there is more to this than what meets the eye. The Indian media has been observed to fabricate think tanks and buy off certain journalists to churn out news that has pro-India and anti-China, Pakistan narratives.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Fabricated Think Tanks</h2>
   <p>The Indian media is known to create and fund think tanks to justify their anti-China and anti-Pakistan rhetoric. One of the biggest examples of such a case is the Observer Research Foundation (ORF). The ORF is one such think tank that is closely associated with the Indian government, and it is known to fabricate news pieces against China and Pakistan. The ORF has been observed to have floated several news pieces that are not based on facts, but rather misinformation to support India's political and military interests.</p>
   <p>Another example is the Eurasian Foundation, another think tank that is known to fabricate news against China and Pakistan on behalf of Indian interests. The Foundation is said to receive funding from the Indian government and has strong links with Indian intelligence agencies.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies of Fabricated Journalism</h2>
   <p>The Indian media has buy-off journalists for a long time now. These journalists, whose main source of income is the Indian media, have been known to resort to fabrication and misinformation in their reports. Here are a few case studies that expose such fabricated journalism:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Ayushman Jamwal:</strong> Jamwal is a journalist with the Indian Express, and his story on PLA soldiers crying like babies went viral. However, later it turned out to be completely fake, and Jamwal was caught using a photograph that was taken in 1983 during a flood in China to justify his lies.</li>
    <li><strong>Vishnu Som:</strong> Som is a journalist with NDTV and is notorious for fabricating news against China. In one of his reports, he claimed that China was moving its forces to the Ladakh region of India. However, when confronted with facts, Som admitted that he had no evidence to back his claims.</li>
    <li><strong>Sudhir Chaudhary:</strong> Chaudhary is a well-known journalist with Zee News. He is known for his anti-China, Pakistan rhetoric. In one of his reports, he claimed that China had deployed 5,000 soldiers in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). Later, it was found out that there was no evidence to support his claims, and he had fabricated the news.</li>
   </ul>
