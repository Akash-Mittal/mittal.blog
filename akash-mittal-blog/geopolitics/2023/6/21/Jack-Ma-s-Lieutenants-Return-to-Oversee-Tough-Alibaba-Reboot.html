     <p>Once upon a time, Alibaba was considered a revolutionary e-commerce giant. But since Jack Ma's retirement, the company has struggled to keep up with the fierce competition in the Chinese market. To address this challenge, Ma's trusted lieutenants are returning to the company to oversee a tough reboot of Alibaba.</p>

     <h2>Examples of the Struggle</h2>
     <p>Alibaba is facing several challenges that have contributed to its decline in the Chinese market. One such example is the rise of short video platforms like Douyin and Kuaishou, which have preferences that differ from traditional e-commerce platforms like Alibaba. Another challenge is the increasing scrutiny from regulators on the company's business practices.</p>

     <h2>Case Studies on the Reboot</h2>
     <p>One key aspect of the reboot is the return of Alibaba's previous CEO, Jonathan Lu, who will take over as CEO of Lazada, the company's Southeast Asia e-commerce unit. Lu is expected to bring stability and a renewed focus on the region to Lazada, which has struggled to turn a profit since being acquired by Alibaba in 2016.</p>
     <p>Another example is the newly-formed Alibaba Digital Economy and New Retail Business Group, which will be led by Alibaba's current CEO, Daniel Zhang. This group will focus on digital transformation and innovation to help Alibaba stay ahead of the competition.</p>
