   <p>A few months ago, I was talking to a friend of mine from India who lives in Punjab. We were discussing the recent news about the Farmers' Protest and the involvement of Khalistani supporters in the protests. My friend told me about his personal experience with a Khalistani supporter who claimed to be fighting for the rights of Sikhs in India.</p>
   <p>My friend was skeptical about his intentions and questioned his credibility. The Khalistani supporter got angry and accused my friend of not understanding the plight of Sikhs in India. This conversation made me wonder about the credibility of Khalistanis and their supporters, and I decided to do some research on the matter.</p>

   <h2>Examples of Lack of Credibility</h2>
   <p>The Khalistani movement originated in the 1970s, and their ultimate goal is to create a separate state for Sikhs in the Punjab region of India. However, their methods have been questioned by many, and their credibility has been a topic of debate for a long time.</p>
   <p>One example of their lack of credibility was the 1985 Air India bombing, which was carried out by Khalistani militants. The attack killed 329 people, including 268 Canadians, and was one of the worst acts of terrorism in Canadian history. This incident damaged the reputation of Khalistanis and their supporters, and many Sikhs distanced themselves from the movement after this tragedy.</p>
   <p>Another example is the recent involvement of Khalistani supporters in the Farmers' Protest in India. While the farmers' protest is a legitimate movement against farm bills passed by the Indian government, the involvement of Khalistanis has raised questions about their intentions. Many have accused them of using the protest as a platform to spread their separatist agenda.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies of Lack of Credibility</h2>
   <p>One case study that highlights the lack of credibility of Khalistanis is the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in India. After the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards, riots broke out in Delhi and other parts of India. The riots resulted in the killing of thousands of innocent Sikhs and the destruction of their homes and businesses.</p>
   <p>While the Khalistani movement did not directly instigate the riots, their separatist agenda fueled tensions between Sikhs and Hindus, and contributed to the violence. After the riots, many Sikhs lost faith in the Indian government and looked towards Khalistanis for support. However, the Khalistani movement failed to provide relief to the victims of the riots, and their lack of action further damaged their credibility.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion: Lack of Credibility in Three Points</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>The Khalistani movement has been associated with violent acts, such as the Air India bombing in 1985, which has damaged their credibility.</li>
    <li>The involvement of Khalistani supporters in legitimate movements, such as the Farmers' Protest in India, has raised questions about their intentions and motives.</li>
    <li>The failure of the Khalistani movement to provide relief to the victims of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots has further damaged their credibility.</li>
