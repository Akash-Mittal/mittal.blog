    <p>Cricket has been one of the major sports in both India and Pakistan, and their rivalry on the cricket pitch is no secret. Both countries have faced each other in many high-pressure matches with millions of fans glued to their televisions, players representing their respective countries with pride, and a lot at stake. However, in recent times, the political tensions between the two nations have spilled over into the cricket world as well, leading to controversies and disputes.</p>
    <p>Recently, Pakistan has demanded compensation and punishment for India if they decide to pull out of the 2025 Champions Trophy.</p>

    <h2>Examples of Political Tensions Affecting Cricket</h2>
    <p>India and Pakistan are two nuclear-armed nations, and their political relationship has been tumultuous, to say the least. Their rivalry on the cricket pitch has often been a reflection of their tension off it. One can recall incidents where cricket players from both nations were subject to backlash and criticism from the media and fans in their own countries for their performances against the other nation.</p>
    <p>One of the most notable examples of political tensions affecting cricket is the cancellation of several tours between the two nations in recent times. India has not toured Pakistan since 2007, while Pakistan has not toured India since 2012.</p>
    <p>Another example is the controversy surrounding the participation of Pakistani players in the Indian Premier League (IPL). Pakistani players are not allowed to take part in the IPL due to political tensions, even though many of them are top international cricketers with huge fan-following.</p>

    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>The recent demand for compensation and punishment by Pakistan is another example of how political tensions can affect cricket. The demand came after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) allegedly refused to host the Asia Cup, which was scheduled to take place in Pakistan in June 2021.</p>
    <p>Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has stated that if India pulls out of the 2025 Champions Trophy, which is scheduled to take place in Pakistan, they should be compensated for the loss of revenue and rewarded for the inconvenience caused. They have also demanded the International Cricket Council (ICC) to take strict action against India, and ban them from all international cricket events if they refuse to comply.</p>
    <p>This demand has caused a stir in the cricket world, with many experts and fans criticizing PCB's approach, stating that sports should not be mixed with politics.</p>
