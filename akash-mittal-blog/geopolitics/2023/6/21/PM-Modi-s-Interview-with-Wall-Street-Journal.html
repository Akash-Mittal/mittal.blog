    <p>During his interview with the Wall Street Journal, PM Modi shared an interesting story about how the Indian government has been able to tackle corruption.</p>
    <p>He explained that in the past, government officials would demand bribes from citizens in order to complete their work. However, the government implemented a tool called the Jan Dhan Yojana, which allowed citizens to open bank accounts with no minimum balance required. This moved millions of people who had never banked before into banks.</p>
    <p>By doing this, the government was able to eliminate fake bank accounts and the need for bribe money, as officials could no longer demand cash payments. This is just one example of the innovative approaches being taken by the Indian government to tackle corruption and improve the lives of its citizens.</p>

    <h2>Ties with US</h2>
    <p>PM Modi emphasized the importance of the strong relationship between India and the United States. He praised President Trump for his commitment to fighting terrorism and for recognizing India's efforts in this area as well.</p>
    <p>He also spoke about the potential for increasing trade between the two countries, calling for more investment from the US in areas such as infrastructure, defense, and energy. PM Modi believes that this trade relationship has great potential to benefit both countries and improve the global economy.</p>
    <h3>Example: India-US Trade</h3>
    <p>One example of India-US trade is in the technology industry. American tech companies have been investing heavily in India, and Indian companies have been partnering with US firms to drive innovation. This has led to the creation of many new jobs and growth in the technology sector in both countries.</p>
    <h4>Case Study: Infosys</h4>
    <p>Infosys is an Indian multinational tech company that provides business consulting, technology, engineering, and outsourcing services. The company has a significant presence in the US and has been partnering with American companies to drive innovation and job growth.</p>
    <p>For example, Infosys has partnered with General Electric to develop and implement software solutions for GE's healthcare division. This partnership has helped GE cut down on costs and improve efficiency, while also providing jobs for Indian workers.</p>

    <h2>India's Role in the World</h2>
    <p>PM Modi spoke about how India is becoming a major player on the world stage, thanks to its strong economy, stable government, and commitment to democracy and free market principles.</p>
    <p>He sees India as a partner for many countries around the world, especially in the areas of trade, investment, and security. He also believes that India has an opportunity to lead on issues such as climate change and clean energy, given its abundant solar energy potential.</p>
    <h3>Example: India-Africa Partnership</h3>
    <p>India has been working to strengthen ties with African countries in recent years, including through initiatives such as the India-Africa Business Forum. This partnership has led to increased trade and investment between India and African countries, as well as cooperation on issues such as healthcare and education.</p>
    <h4>Case Study: Bharti Airtel</h4>
    <p>Bharti Airtel is an Indian multinational telecommunications company. The company has operations in 18 countries across Asia and Africa, making it one of the largest mobile network operators in the world.</p>
    <p>In Africa, Bharti Airtel has been working to provide affordable and accessible mobile services to underserved communities. The company has invested heavily in building out its network infrastructure in Africa, and has partnered with local governments to provide digital education and healthcare services to communities in need.</p>

   <section id="un-reform">
    <h2>UN Reform</h2>
    <p>PM Modi called for reform of the United Nations, saying that it needs to become more representative and accountable to its member countries. He also emphasized the importance of multilateralism and the need for countries to work together to address global challenges.</p>
    <h3>Example: UN Security Council</h3>
    <p>One area of UN reform that has been discussed for many years is the composition of the UN Security Council. Many countries believe that the current makeup of the Security Council is outdated and does not reflect the geopolitical realities of the world today.</p>
    <h4>Case Study: Japan's Bid for Security Council Seat</h4>
    <p>Japan is one country that has been pushing for reform of the Security Council, including a bid for a permanent seat on the council. Japan has argued that as the world's third-largest economy and a major player in global issues such as trade and security, it deserves a permanent seat on the council.</p>
    <p>However, this proposal has been met with opposition from other countries, including China, which has its own ambitions for a greater role in the Security Council. The debate over UN reform and the composition of the Security Council is likely to continue for many years to come.</p>

   <section id="ukraine-russia">
    <h2>Ukraine-Russia War</h2>
    <p>PM Modi expressed his concern over the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, saying that it is important for countries to respect each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity. He called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict and for international norms to be upheld.</p>
    <h3>Example: UN Resolution on Ukraine</h3>
    <p>The conflict between Ukraine and Russia has been a subject of concern for the international community for many years. In 2014, the United Nations passed a resolution condemning Russia's annexation of Crimea and calling for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.</p>
    <h4>Case Study: Ukrainian Crisis</h4>
    <p>The conflict between Ukraine and Russia began in 2014, when pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine's eastern regions declared independence from Ukraine. Russia has been accused of backing these separatist groups and of sending troops into Ukrainian territory.</p>
    <p>The conflict has resulted in thousands of deaths and a significant humanitarian crisis. The international community has been working to resolve the conflict through diplomatic means, but a lasting, peaceful resolution has so far proven elusive.</p>
