    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>It is a well-known fact that India and China have a complicated relationship. From political tensions to economic rivalry, the two countries have been at odds for years. One of the main sources of tension between the two nations is their trade relationship. India's trade deficit with China has been increasing year after year, leading to concerns about the impact it has on India's economy. But, what exactly is the trade dilemma with China?</p>
    <p>Let's explore this issue in depth and understand the challenges that India faces in its trade relationship with China.</p>
   </section>
   <section id="examples">
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>India's imports from China have been increasing at an alarming rate, leading to a widening trade deficit. In 2018, India's imports from China were worth $70.32 billion, while India's exports to China were only $16.75 billion, resulting in a trade deficit of $53.57 billion.</p>
    <p>The problem with this trade deficit is that it puts a strain on India's economy. It implies that India is importing more than it is exporting, which leads to a shortage of foreign currency and puts downward pressure on the rupee. This, in turn, affects the country's balance of payments and creates a dependency on foreign investment.</p>
    <p>This dependency on foreign investment can also be seen in infrastructure projects. For instance, Chinese companies have invested heavily in the development of India's ports and highways. However, this has led to concerns about the security of these projects and the possibility of Chinese influence in India's internal affairs.</p>

    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <h3>Case Study 1: The Mobile Phone Industry</h3>
    <p>The mobile phone industry in India is a prime example of the challenges India faces in its trade relationship with China. India's market for mobile phones is dominated by Chinese companies such as Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo. These companies have taken over a significant market share due to their competitive pricing and the quality of their products.</p>
    <p>However, the downside of this dominance is that it leads to a disproportionate trade deficit. India's mobile phone imports from China are estimated to be worth over $10 billion, while India's exports to China in this sector are less than $1 billion. This has led to concerns among Indian policymakers about the sustainability of this trade relationship.</p>
    <h3>Case Study 2: The Textile Industry</h3>
    <p>The textile industry in India is another sector that has been impacted by India's trade relationship with China. India is a major exporter of cotton, but it is facing intense competition from China in the world market. China's production of cotton has increased significantly, and it has been able to offer lower prices, which has led to a decline in India's cotton exports.</p>
    <p>The textile industry in India also faces competition from China in the domestic market. Chinese textiles are often cheaper than Indian textiles, which has led Indian textile manufacturers to demand increased protectionism from the government.</p>
