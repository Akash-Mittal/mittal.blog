   <!-- Introductory Story -->
   <p>It was a bright and sunny day in New Delhi when the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, boarded the flight to the United States of America. This visit was going to be a landmark one for several reasons. The two countries were going to discuss crucial matters related to defence, critical technology, and trade, among others.</p>
   <p>This trip was also noteworthy because it would be the first in-person meeting between Modi and US President Joe Biden since he took office earlier this year. The two leaders were expected to forge a stronger partnership between the two nations and work towards a common goal that would benefit both of them.</p><!-- Examples -->
   <h2>Defence and Critical Tech on the Agenda</h2>
   <p>One of the major topics of discussion between Modi and Biden was defence. India and the US have been strengthening their defence ties over the last few years, and the relationship between the two countries has never been stronger. The US has become one of India's biggest suppliers of defence equipment, and this trend is expected to continue in the coming years.</p>
   <p>The two countries will also discuss the issue of critical technology, which is another crucial area that needs attention. India has been making strides in the field of technology and innovation, and there are numerous opportunities for collaboration between the two countries in this area. The US is home to some of the world's biggest tech giants, and India can benefit greatly from their expertise and experience.</p><!-- Case Studies -->
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <h3>Defence Ties</h3>
   <p>One of the most significant examples of the growing defence ties between India and the US is the deal for the purchase of 24 MH-60R Seahawk helicopters. The $2.4 billion deal was signed earlier this year, and the first of these helicopters is expected to be delivered to India in 2023. The MH-60R is a state-of-the-art maritime helicopter used by the US Navy and is expected to give India a significant boost in its maritime capabilities.</p>
   <h3>Critical Technology</h3>
   <p>Another example of the growing cooperation between the two countries in the field of critical technology is the India-US Partnership on Climate Innovation. This partnership aims to accelerate the deployment of clean energy solutions and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The partnership will also focus on developing new technologies and promoting innovation in the field of clean energy.</p><!--  -->
