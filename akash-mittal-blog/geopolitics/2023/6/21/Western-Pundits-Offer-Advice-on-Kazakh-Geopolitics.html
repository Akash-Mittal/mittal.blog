  <p>As the world is growing more interconnected, geopolitical issues have become a concern for many countries. Kazakhstan, a Central Asian country, is no exception. While the country has made significant strides in its economic development and international relations, it faces numerous challenges on the geopolitical front. Kazakhstan, which is the world's largest landlocked country, shares borders with Russia, China, and several other countries. Due to its strategic location and abundant natural resources, the country is considered a key player in the region. Hence, many Western pundits are offering their advice on Kazakh geopolitics.</p>
  
  <p>In 2019, the Kazakh government faced a major challenge when it had to deal with a protest against its proposed land reform. The protest, which was held in the capital city of Nur-Sultan, was one of the largest in the country's history. The government had proposed to amend the land code to allow foreigners to lease land for up to 25 years, which many Kazakhs feared would lead to a loss of their valuable agricultural land. The protests highlighted the growing disillusionment among the country's citizens and the need for more inclusive policymaking.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Western Pundits' Advice</h2>
  <p>Many Western pundits have offered their advice on Kazakh geopolitics. William Courtney, former US ambassador to Kazakhstan, has advised the country to diversify its economy and strengthen its institutions to attract foreign investment. He has also suggested that Kazakhstan should improve its relations with neighboring countries to promote regional stability.</p>
  <p>Similarly, Carol Saivetz, a senior advisor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has advised the Kazakh government to focus on energy security and diversify its oil exports to reduce its dependence on Russia. She has also suggested that Kazakhstan should strengthen its relations with the EU and NATO to counterbalance Chinese influence in the region.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>Kazakhstan's relations with Russia have been a major concern for many Western pundits. The country relies heavily on Russia for its energy exports, but it has also sought to diversify its energy exports by building new pipelines to China and the EU. However, Kazakhstan's close ties with Russia have also had an impact on its domestic politics. For example, in 2019, a prominent opposition politician was sentenced to prison for 7 years on charges of financing a terrorist organization, which many observers believe was politically motivated due to his criticism of Russia.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, Kazakhstan's relations with China have been growing in recent years, as the two countries have signed numerous agreements on trade and infrastructure development. However, this has also raised concerns among some Western pundits about China's growing influence in the region and the potential for debt traps and environmental issues associated with Chinese investments.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>Kazakhstan needs to diversify its economy to attract foreign investment and reduce its dependence on oil and gas exports.</li>
   <li>The country needs to strengthen its institutions and promote more inclusive policymaking to address the growing disillusionment among its citizens.</li>
   <li>Kazakhstan needs to balance its relations with Russia and China and strengthen its ties with the EU and NATO to promote regional stability.</li>
  </ol>
