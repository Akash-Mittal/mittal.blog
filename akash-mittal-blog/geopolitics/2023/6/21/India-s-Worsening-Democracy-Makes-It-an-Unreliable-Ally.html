   <p>India, the world's largest democracy, is increasingly showing signs of authoritarianism under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). This erosion of democracy has serious implications not only for India but also for its allies around the world. In this article, we will explore the worrying trend of India's worsening democracy and its impact on its role as a reliable ally.</p>
   <h2>The Story of a Farmers' Protest</h2>
   <p>In 2020, India witnessed massive protests by farmers against three farm laws passed by the BJP government. The laws were aimed at liberalizing the agricultural sector and allowing private players to operate in it. However, farmers feared that this would lead to the end of government support and exploitation by corporations.</p>
   <p>The protests erupted in Punjab and Haryana and soon spread to other parts of the country. The government responded with force, using tear gas, water cannons, and even batons to disperse the protesters. Several farmers were injured, and some even died due to police action.</p>
   <p>This incident shows how India's democracy is under threat. Instead of listening to the demands of the farmers, the government chose to suppress their voice and use force to silence them. This is not how a democracy should function, and it raises serious questions about the state of democracy in India.</p>
   <h2>Examples of India's Erosion of Democracy</h2>
   <p>The farmers' protest is just one example of how India's democracy is being eroded under the BJP government. Here are a few more examples:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The government has been cracking down on the media and free speech. Several journalists have been arrested for reporting on issues that the government doesn't want publicized.</li>
    <li>The government has introduced laws that allow it to monitor and track its citizens' online and offline activities.</li>
    <li>The government has been targeting students and activists who speak out against its policies. In 2019, several students were arrested for protesting against a new citizenship law that discriminated against Muslims.</li>
    <li>The BJP government has been accused of manipulating the judiciary to silence dissent. Several judges who have spoken out against the government have either been transferred or denied promotions.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <p>Let's take a look at some of the specific cases that show how India's worsening democracy is making it an unreliable ally:</p>
   <h3>1. The Case of United States</h3>
   <p>India has historically been a close ally of the United States. However, under the Modi government, several issues have strained the relationship between the two countries. One of the main concerns for the US is India's increasing closeness to Russia and China, both of which are seen as adversaries by the US. This has led to a conflict of interest between the two countries. Additionally, India's human rights record has also become a point of concern for the US.</p>
   <h3>2. The Case of Pakistan</h3>
   <p>India and Pakistan have a long-standing history of conflict. However, under the Modi government, tensions between the two countries have heightened. India's decision to abrogate Article 370, which gave special status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir, and the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act have been viewed as anti-Muslim measures by Pakistan. This has resulted in increased hostilities between the two countries, making it difficult for them to cooperate on issues of mutual interest.</p>
   <h3>3. The Case of Nepal</h3>
   <p>Nepal and India have had a longstanding friendship, with India being one of Nepal's largest trading partners and providing significant economic assistance to the country. However, under the Modi government, relations between the two countries have been strained. India's unilateral decision to create an administrative area of Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura has been criticized by Nepal, which claims that the area belongs to it. This has led to protests in Nepal and strained relations between the two countries.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, India's worsening democracy is making it an unreliable ally. Its erosion of democracy has serious implications not only for India but also for its allies around the world. Here are three key points to sum up:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>India's increasing authoritarianism under the BJP government has led to a decline in democracy, which is a cause of concern for its allies.</li>
    <li>India's growing closeness to countries like Russia and China, which are viewed as adversaries by the US, has weakened the relationship between the two countries.</li>
    <li>India's conflict with its neighbors, such as Pakistan and Nepal, has also strained its relationships with these countries and made it difficult for them to cooperate on issues of mutual interest.</li>
