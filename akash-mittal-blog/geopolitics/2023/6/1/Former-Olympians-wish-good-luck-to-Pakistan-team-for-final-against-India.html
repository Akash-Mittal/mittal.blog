  <p style="text-align:center;">It's the greatest rivalry in cricket – Pakistan vs India. And the stage is set for the final match of the Asia Cup 2018. As the two teams prepare for the biggest clash of the tournament, former Olympians from Pakistan have come out to wish their team luck.</p>
  <h2 style="text-align:center;">An interesting story</h2>
  <p>Back in the 1990s, Pakistan was one of the dominant teams in world cricket. The team had some of the best players in the game, and they were feared by opposition teams. But there was one team that Pakistan always had trouble beating – India.</p>
  <p>The two teams played each other in numerous high-profile matches, and India seemed to have the upper hand every time. Pakistan's players and fans were desperate for a win against their arch-rivals.</p>
  <p>Then, in the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok, something incredible happened. Pakistan and India met in the gold medal match, and Pakistan finally managed to beat India in a major tournament. The win was celebrated across the country, and it gave Pakistan's cricket team the confidence they needed to take on India in future matches.</p>
  <p>Now, twenty years later, Pakistan and India are once again facing off in a major tournament final. And former Olympians are hoping that Pakistan can once again emerge victorious.</p>
  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Quantifiable examples</h2>
  <p>Let's take a look at some of the numbers that show just how important this match is for both teams:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>India has won six of the last ten ODIs they've played against Pakistan.</li>
   <li>Pakistan has only beaten India once in a major tournament final – the 2017 Champions Trophy.</li>
   <li>The last time the two teams met in the Asia Cup, India won by nine wickets.</li>
   <li>India's Rohit Sharma has scored 269 runs in the tournament so far, while Pakistan's Shoaib Malik has scored 174.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These numbers show just how close the match is likely to be. Both teams have some of the best players in the world, and each will be fighting to come out on top.</p>
