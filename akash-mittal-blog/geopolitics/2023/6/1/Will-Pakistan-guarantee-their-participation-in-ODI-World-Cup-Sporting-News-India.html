   <p>The International Cricket Council (ICC) has sought a guarantee from Pakistan over their participation in the upcoming One Day International (ODI) World Cup. This comes in the light of recent political tension between India and Pakistan, which has led to calls for a boycott of Pakistan by Indian cricket fans and even some Indian politicians.</p>

    <p>"The ICC has made it clear that they want assurance from Pakistan that they will be participating in the World Cup. This is to ensure that there are no last-minute withdrawals or controversies that could mar the tournament."</p>

   <h3>Why Pakistan's Participation is in Question</h3>
   <p>The recent suicide bombing in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, which claimed the lives of 40 Indian soldiers, has led to a sharp escalation of tensions between India and Pakistan. India has accused Pakistan of supporting the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorist group, which claimed responsibility for the attack. Pakistan has denied the accusations but tensions between the two countries remain high.</p>
   <p>As a result, there have been calls in India for a boycott of Pakistan in all areas, including cricket. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has not yet taken a decision on this but some Indian politicians have called for the World Cup to be shifted from England to another country if Pakistan is allowed to participate.</p>
   <h3>Quantifiable Examples</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Since the Pulwama attack, there have been reports of Indian cricket fans burning effigies of Pakistani cricketers and even breaking their televisions in protest.</li>
    <li>Some Indian politicians have called for a nationwide boycott of Pakistani products, which could potentially affect Pakistani cricket merchandise sales in India.</li>
    <li>During the Asia Cup in 2018, Indian captain Virat Kohli famously told a Pakistani fan to 'leave India' when the fan said he loved Kohli's batting but preferred Pakistani players. This incident shows the level of passion and emotion that cricket can evoke in India and how it could potentially impact Pakistan's participation in the ODI World Cup.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Pakistan's Stance</h3>
   <p>Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ehsan Mani has stated that Pakistan will not pull out of the World Cup unless there is clear legal proof against the team. He has also said that they will not be affected by any boycott or pressure from India.</p>
   <div class="quote">
    <p>"We are not going to react to any statements made by Indian politicians. India can do whatever it pleases, we don't care. Our stance is very clear - unless there is clear evidence against us, we will participate in the World Cup as planned."</p>
    <p>- Ehsan Mani, Chairman of PCB</p>

   <h3>Conclusion</h3>
   <p>It remains to be seen how this situation will play out and whether Pakistan will eventually provide the required guarantee to the ICC. However, what is clear is that the political tensions between India and Pakistan have spilled over into the cricketing world and could potentially impact the upcoming ODI World Cup.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, here are three key points to consider:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Pakistan's participation in the ODI World Cup has come into question following the recent Pulwama attack and the ensuing tensions between India and Pakistan.</li>
    <li>The ICC has sought a guarantee from Pakistan that they will participate in the tournament to prevent last-minute withdrawals or controversies.</li>
    <li>Pakistan has stated that they will not be affected by any boycott or pressure from India and will only pull out of the tournament if there is clear legal proof against them.</li>
   </ol>
