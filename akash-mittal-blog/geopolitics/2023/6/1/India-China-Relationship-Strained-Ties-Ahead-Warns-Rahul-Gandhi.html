  <p>A few weeks back, an interesting story made the rounds on social media. It was about locals in the India-China border region who had suddenly begun to experience poor network connectivity. Reason? Chinese telecom companies recently installed 4G towers in their territory, which were reportedly causing interference in Indian telecom networks, leading to a connectivity disruption in the border villages.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Though amusing, this event is a mere reflection of the deep-rooted issues that are brewing between the neighboring countries - issues that are likely to have far-reaching consequences.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The Rising Conflicts</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Tensions between India and China have been rising for some time now, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only added fuel to the fire. The ongoing border dispute has become increasingly violent, with several incidents of hand-to-hand combat between the armies of both countries over the past months. India has alleged that China has been making forays into Indian territory, and has been building infrastructure in the disputed areas.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>But the standoff is not just limited to the border dispute. India has been concerned with China's influence in several other areas. For instance, India has been apprehensive about China's presence in South Asia, particularly its involvement in development projects in countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal. The Indian government has also been wary of China's growing economic and military power in the region.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In this context, Rahul Gandhi, one of India's prominent leaders, recently commented that India-China relationship is going to be tough in the coming months. According to him, the border conflict is just the tip of the iceberg, and there are deeper issues that need to be addressed.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable Examples</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The tensions between India and China are reflected in trade and economic figures as well. India's trade deficit with China grew by 34.5% in 2019-20, with China's imports to India exceeding Indian exports by a massive $47.7 billion. India has been trying to address this issue by reducing its dependence on Chinese imports and promoting domestic production. However, this has not been an easy task, given China's dominance in several areas, such as electronics, pharmaceuticals, and engineering goods.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another area of concern is in the tech space. Recently, the Indian government banned several Chinese apps, including the popular video-sharing app TikTok, citing security concerns. This move was seen as India's attempt to counter China's growing digital influence in the country.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>However, the impact of these measures is likely to be short-lived. For instance, India's attempts to promote domestic production are constrained by factors like lack of skilled labor and infrastructure bottlenecks. Similarly, the ban on Chinese apps has not really affected China's presence in Indian cyberspace, as it continues to dominate in several other sectors.</p>
