  <h1>China Woos Dimon Musk Amid Pressure on Xi to Boost Economy</h1> <img src="images/China-Woos-Dimon-Musk-Amid-Pressure-on-Xi-to-Boost-Economy.jpeg" alt="+China-Woos-Dimon-Musk-Amid-Pressure-on-Xi-to-Boost-Economy+">
  <p></p>
  <p>China has been ramping up its efforts to attract billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's attention, and the reasons for this are twofold. Firstly, Musk's recent business ventures have been making headlines worldwide, with his new electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla expanding operations in China. Secondly, Chinese leader Xi Jinping is under growing pressure to boost the country's economy, which has taken a hit due to the ongoing US-China trade war and the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The Chinese government has been actively courting Musk, both through official channels and through state-owned businesses. For example, the state-owned China Development Bank has reportedly offered Tesla low-interest loans for its operations in China, while the Shanghai government has promised to help the company secure more land for its new factory in the city. Such gestures may be seen as an attempt to cement Musk's interest in the Chinese market and to ensure a continued flow of investment.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>However, China's efforts to woo Musk are not simply a matter of economics. Musk is seen as a key player in the ongoing US-China tech rivalry, which has been heating up in recent years. China has long sought to lessen its dependence on US technology and to build its own tech giants, and Musk's success with Tesla and his other companies - SpaceX and The Boring Company - is seen as a challenge to this goal. Thus, winning over Musk may be seen as a strategic victory for China, as well as an economic one.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable Examples</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>China's focus on EVs and clean energy is well known, and Musk's Tesla brand has been a key player in this sector. In 2019, Tesla sold around 112,000 vehicles in China, representing a 31% increase from the previous year. This success has prompted the company to ramp up its operations in the country, with the opening of a new factory in Shanghai in 2020. This factory is expected to produce around 150,000 vehicles per year, and will create thousands of local jobs.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>China's own EV market is also booming, with around 1.2 million new energy vehicles (NEVs) sold in 2020, a year-on-year increase of over 12%. China is now the world's largest NEV market, and the government has set a target of NEVs accounting for 25% of all new vehicle sales by 2025. This presents a huge opportunity for Tesla and other EV manufacturers, and may be a key reason behind China's efforts to court Musk.</p>
