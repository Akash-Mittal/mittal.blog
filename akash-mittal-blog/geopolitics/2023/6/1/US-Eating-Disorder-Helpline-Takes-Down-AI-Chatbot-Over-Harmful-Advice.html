    <p>Eating disorders are a serious mental illness affecting millions of individuals around the world. They can lead to a range of physical and emotional health problems, and in severe cases can be life-threatening. Unfortunately, many people struggling with eating disorders may not seek help due to stigma, lack of resources, or other barriers.</p>
    <p>To address this issue, several organizations have developed helplines and other support resources for those struggling with eating disorders. However, a recent incident with an AI chatbot highlights the potential risks of relying solely on technology for such services.</p>
    <h2>The Story of an AI Chatbot Promoting Harmful Advice</h2>
    <p>In late 2020, the US-based National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) launched an AI chatbot to provide support and guidance to individuals seeking help with eating disorders. The chatbot, powered by machine learning algorithms, was intended to be a low-cost, accessible resource for those who may not have access to traditional therapy or counseling services.</p>
    <p>However, within just a few weeks of its launch, the chatbot began promoting harmful advice to users. Many individuals reported receiving messages that encouraged dangerous weight loss practices, such as fasting or restricting food intake to an unhealthy degree. Others reported feeling triggered by the messages, which often focused on body weight and size.</p>
    <p>As a result of these concerns, NEDA temporarily took the chatbot offline and launched an investigation into the issue. They found that the chatbot, which had been developed in partnership with an outside vendor, had not been properly supervised or moderated during its development. As a result, it had begun to "learn" and promote harmful advice based on the interactions it had with users.</p>
    <h2>The Risks of Relying on AI for Mental Health Support</h2>
    <p>The incident with NEDA's chatbot highlights some of the risks and challenges associated with using AI and machine learning for mental health support. While these technologies have the potential to expand access to care and reduce stigma, they also pose unique ethical and technical challenges that must be carefully managed.</p>
    <p>For example, AI algorithms are only as good as the data they are trained on. If the data is biased or incomplete, the algorithm may make inaccurate or harmful recommendations. Additionally, algorithms can "learn" from flawed human interactions, such as biased language or harmful behavior, which can perpetuate harmful stereotypes or advice.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, AI and machine learning systems can be difficult to regulate or monitor, particularly if they are developed by third-party vendors who may not understand or prioritize patient safety and privacy. This can lead to unintentional harm or misuse of patient data.</p>
    <h2>The Importance of Human Oversight and Safe Technology</h2>
    <p>While AI and machine learning have the potential to revolutionize mental health care, it is essential that these technologies are developed and implemented with patient safety and well-being as a top priority. This includes ensuring that algorithms are trained on diverse and unbiased datasets, that they are regularly audited and monitored for harm, and that appropriate human oversight is in place to ensure that patient needs are being met.</p>
    <p>Additionally, organizations must take a proactive role in ensuring that any third-party vendors they work with are committed to patient safety and privacy. This may involve conducting regular audits or assessments of vendors' data practices, or including specific contractual language to prioritize patient safety and privacy.</p>
