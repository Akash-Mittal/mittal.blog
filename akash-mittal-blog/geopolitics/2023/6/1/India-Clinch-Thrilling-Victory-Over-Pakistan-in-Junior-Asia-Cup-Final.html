  <p>The cricket rivalry between India and Pakistan is well documented, with the two nations sharing a fierce competitiveness on the pitch. But it is not only in the senior cricketing world where this rivalry is played out, as was proved in the final of the Junior Asia Cup.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The tournament, which was held in Bangladesh, had witnessed some thrilling matches in the lead up to the final between India and Pakistan. The stage was set for a classic encounter; the two teams had met earlier in the tournament, with India edging a tight game 3-2.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The atmosphere was electric, as the two sides took to the field for the final. Pakistan won the toss and elected to field first, allowing India to bat. The Indian openers were cautious at first, but soon found their stride and began scoring runs at a healthy rate.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The Pakistani bowlers, however, were determined to keep the Indian batsmen in check, and took wickets at regular intervals. Despite this, India managed to post a challenging total of 261 runs for the loss of 7 wickets.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Pakistan needed a strong start to their innings, but they lost their first wicket early on. However, the Pakistani batsmen showed great resilience, and managed to keep pace with the required run rate. The Indian bowlers, though, were not going to make it easy for their rivals, and stuck to their task with great discipline.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The tension was palpable as the match reached its climax. Pakistan needed 11 runs from the final over to win, but were thwarted by some quality bowling from the Indian bowler.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In the end, India emerged victorious by the narrowest of margins, winning by just 2 runs. The Indian team erupted in jubilation, while the Pakistani players were left to ponder what might have been.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This was a classic encounter between two great rivals, and a testament to the spirit of competition that exists between India and Pakistan.</p>
