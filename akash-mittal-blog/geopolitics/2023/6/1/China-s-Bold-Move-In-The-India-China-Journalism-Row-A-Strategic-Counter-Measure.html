   <p class="intro-story">In the midst of escalating tensions between India and China due to the controversial border dispute, another battle is being waged - a journalism row. At the center of the controversy is the Indian news website, Scroll.in.</p>
   <p>On June 29, 2020, China announced that it had decided to take reciprocal measures against India, in response to India's decision to expel three Chinese journalists working for China's state-run media organization, Xinhua, in May 2020. China's foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, stated that the Chinese authorities had revoked the press cards of two Indian journalists working for Scroll.in, who needed the cards to stay in China legally.</p>
   <p>India, however, maintains that it expelled the Chinese journalists due to their activities that were deemed to be detrimental to India's national security. In a press release, India's Ministry of External Affairs stated that "these Chinese nationals were found to be indulging in activities incompatible with their status as journalists." Furthermore, the Indian government reiterated its commitment to the freedom of the press and stated that the expulsions were not linked to any specific bilateral issue.</p>
   <p>So, was China's action a strategic counter measure against India, or was it simply a tit-for-tat move? Let's take a closer look.</p>
   <h2 class="sub-heading"> China's Counter Measure</h2>
   <p>The diplomatic spat between India and China has reignited, with each country blaming the other for initiating the conflict. Here are some quantifiable examples of China's counter measure in the journalism row:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>China's foreign ministry revoked the press cards of two Indian journalists working for Scroll.in, making it impossible for them to continue reporting from China.</li>
    <li>Chinese authorities refused to issue new press cards to the Indian journalists, thereby ensuring that they could not stay in China legally.</li>
    <li>India's ministry of external affairs issued a statement calling China's action "unacceptable and unjustified," and demanded that the Chinese authorities reconsider their decision.</li>
    <li>The Indian government also stated that it would take reciprocal measures, as and when the need arises.</li>
