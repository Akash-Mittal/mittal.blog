  <p>Once upon a time, there were two neighboring countries sharing a common border - India and Pakistan. One was a democracy with a vibrant economy while the other was a nation, riddled with political turmoil, run by the establishment. While India's GDP growth rate soared, Pakistan's political landscape remained mired in controversies and uncertainties. This is a story of how India's GDP grew by 7.2%, leaving Pakistan far behind in economic growth.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p> India's GDP Growth</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The Indian economy has been on an upswing for the past few years. In 2018, its gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 7.2%, surpassing China's GDP growth rate. India's GDP is expected to grow at an even faster rate in 2019 and 2020, with an estimated growth rate of 7.5% and 7.7%, respectively. The growth rate of agriculture, manufacturing, and services sectors has been impressive, contributing enormously to India's economic prosperity. The country also has a robust micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) sector, which is the backbone of its economy, employing over 110 million people.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>On the other hand, Pakistan has been grappling with mounting economic challenges. Its GDP grew by a mere 3.3% in 2018, the lowest in the past six years. The economy has been hit hard by inflation, devaluation of the currency, and a widening budget deficit. The World Bank estimates that Pakistan's GDP growth for 2019 will be around 2.7%, reflecting the country's dire economic situation and political uncertainties.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The Political Landscape of Pakistan - A Nation Run by the Establishment</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Pakistan's political landscape is fraught with complexities. The country has been under military rule for a significant part of its history. Even when civilian governments were in power, the military establishment, consisting of the army and intelligence agencies, pulled the strings from the sidelines. The judiciary has also been accused of being under the influence of the establishment, which leads to a lack of accountability and transparency in the country's governance.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Currently, Pakistan is being run by the establishment, with the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government led by Prime Minister Imran Khan acting as a front. Imran Khan, a cricketer-turned-politician, came to power on a wave of populist sentiment, promising to end corruption and bring prosperity to the country. However, his government has been marred by controversies, both domestic and international. The crackdown on opposition parties, the media, and civil society groups has raised concerns about the state of democracy in the country. Pakistan has also been facing diplomatic isolation on the international front, owing to its support for terrorist groups and its fraught relationship with India.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion - Three Key Points</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The contrasting fortunes of India and Pakistan highlight the importance of democracy and economic growth. While India has managed to sustain its economic growth, Pakistan has struggled to keep up with the global pace. The political uncertainties and lack of transparency in Pakistan's governance have hindered its economic progress and damaged its reputation on the international stage. The following three key points summarize the article's core message:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Democracy and transparency in governance are essential for sustainable economic growth.</p>
  <p>2. The military establishment's interference in politics can impede a country's progress, both economically and democratically.</p>
  <p>3. Diplomatic isolation can have severe implications for a country's economic and political well-being.</p>
  <p></p>

For instance, interviewing an Indian entrepreneur who has started a successful business or a Pakistani journalist who has been persecuted for speaking out against the government can add depth and nuance to the article's arguments.</p>
