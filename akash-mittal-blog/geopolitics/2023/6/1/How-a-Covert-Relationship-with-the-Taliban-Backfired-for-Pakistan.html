   <p>It was a sunny day in Peshawar when a group of Taliban fighters entered a bank in the city, brandishing their weapons and demanding money. The bank manager tried to reason with them, but they were ruthless and would not budge. Within minutes, they had escaped with a large sum of money, leaving the bank staff in shock and the police in pursuit.</p>
   <p>But what was even more shocking was the fact that the Taliban fighters had been trained and armed by the Pakistani military, as part of a covert relationship that had been going on for years.</p>
   <h2>The Covert Relationship</h2>
   <p>For years, Pakistan had maintained a covert relationship with the Taliban, providing them with arms, training, and safe havens in its tribal areas. The goal was to use the Taliban as a proxy force against its arch-rival India, and to safeguard its own interests in Afghanistan.</p>
   <p>But what started as a tactical move soon turned into a strategic blunder, as the Taliban fighters turned on their benefactors, unleashing a wave of violence and terrorism that has claimed thousands of lives in Pakistan.</p>
   <h2>The Backlash</h2>
   <p>The backlash was swift and brutal. The Taliban fighters, emboldened by their new-found power and influence, began to launch attacks not only on Pakistan's enemies, but also on Pakistan itself.</p>
   <p>Christine Fair, a scholar of South Asian studies at Georgetown University, wrote that "Pakistan's leaders have been unable or unwilling to confront the jihadists they have cultivated and sustained."</p>
   <p>The situation reached a boiling point in 2014, when the Pakistani Taliban attacked an army school in Peshawar, killing over 140 people, most of them children. The attack sparked outrage and a wave of public condemnation, forcing the government to take action against the Taliban.</p>
   <h2>The Fallout</h2>
   <p>The fallout from the covert relationship with the Taliban has been severe for Pakistan, both domestically and internationally.</p>
   <h3>Domestically:</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Thousands of people have been killed in terrorist attacks, including civilians, military personnel, and government officials.</li>
    <li>Pakistan's economy has been hit hard by the violence and instability, scaring away foreign investment and crippling its tourism industry.</li>
    <li>The relationship between the military and the civilian government has been strained, with the military accused of backing the Taliban and undermining democratic institutions.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Internationally:</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Pakistan has lost credibility and trust among its allies, with the US accusing it of double-dealing and supporting terrorism.</li>
    <li>The country has been put on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) "grey list" for failing to comply with international standards on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing.</li>
    <li>India has used Pakistan's support for the Taliban to justify its own military interventions in the region, exacerbating tensions between the two countries.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>The Lessons Learned</h2>
   <p>The covert relationship with the Taliban has clearly backfired for Pakistan, and there are several lessons that can be learned from this experience:</p>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>Short-term gains can lead to long-term losses.</strong> Pakistan's support for the Taliban was initially seen as a way to gain leverage over its enemies, but it backfired in the long run, leading to a wave of violence and instability that has hurt Pakistan's interests and reputation.</li>
    <li><strong>Cutting ties with terrorist groups is a difficult but necessary step.</strong> Pakistan's reluctance to cut ties with the Taliban was driven by fears that it would lose its strategic depth in Afghanistan, but it ended up costing it dearly. Cutting ties with terrorist groups is never easy, but it is a necessary step towards stability and security.</li>
    <li><strong>Investing in education and economic development is key to countering terrorism.</strong> Pakistan's support for the Taliban was driven by a belief that it could use them as a proxy force against India, but it failed to address the root causes of terrorism, which include poverty, illiteracy, and joblessness. Investing in education and economic development is key to countering terrorism and extremism.</li>
   </ol>
   <p>These are difficult lessons, but they need to be learned if Pakistan is to move forward and build a stable, prosperous, and secure future for itself and its people.</p>
