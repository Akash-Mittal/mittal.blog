  <h1>India Toughens Stance Against Pakistan: Champions Trophy Must be Shifted Out of Pakistan</h1> <img src="images/India-Toughens-Stance-Against-Pakistan-Champions-Trophy-Must-be-Shifted-Out-of-Pakistan.jpeg" alt="+India-Toughens-Stance-Against-Pakistan-Champions-Trophy-Must-be-Shifted-Out-of-Pakistan+">
  <p></p>
  <p>India's stance against Pakistan has become increasingly tough in recent years. The reason stems from long-standing disputes between the two countries over the Kashmir region. India has been lobbying against Pakistan for many years due to its complicity in cross-border terrorism, infiltrating terrorists into India, and killing innocent civilians.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This year, India has called on the International Cricket Council (ICC) to move the Champions Trophy out of Pakistan. India's captain, Rohit Sharma, and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have asserted that Pakistan is not a safe venue for the tournament because of cross-border terrorism, tension between Pakistan and India, and the sheer number of terrorist attacks in the country.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>India has not played a bilateral cricket series with Pakistan since 2012, citing security concerns for players and fans. Yet, they played a cricket match on Pakistani soil as a part of the World Cup tournament back in 2019. The situation now is entirely different. India is rightfully seeking to ensure the safety of its players in a hostile environment.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Despite warnings of terrorist attacks from multiple countries' intelligence agencies, Pakistan continues to host international cricket competitions, including the PSL and the recently concluded New Zealand series. The situation is alarming, as terrorist attacks on sporting events pose a significant risk to players' safety.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>India's efforts to move the upcoming Champions Trophy out of Pakistan are justified, considering the high threat perception for terrorism in the region. India has been vehement in its request, stating that the ICC's priority should be player safety.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Moreover, India also cited concerns over access to information for the players and strong code of conduct. Indian players are unlikely to receive thorough information about their stay and travel in the hostile situation.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>It is reported that India's apprehensions have been put forth to the ICC, and the governing body's disciplinary committee will make a decision soon.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable Examples</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The BCCI has repeatedly been vocal about the tournament's safety concerns in Pakistan. Recently, the BCCI announced its willingness to host the Champions Trophy, as India possesses a better track record of hosting such events where the security of the players is of paramount importance.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>India successfully hosted the T20 World Cup in 2016, which was appreciated globally. In contrast, Pakistan has had a problematic track record of providing safety to the players during their stay and travel.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Last year, the inaugural season of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) faced the brunt of its security issues. The tournament was thrown into disarray after multiple overseas players withdrew their services due to security reasons. The incident hurt the tournament's reputation and caused Pakistan cricket to plummet to new lows.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Therefore, India's stance on player safety and security issues is justified, given the country's experience and track record in hosting international tournaments.</p>

  <p>Eye-catching Title</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>India Toughens Stance Against Pakistan: Champions Trophy Must Be Shifted Out of Pakistan</p>
  <p>Amidst growing concerns of player safety and cross-border terrorism, India is adamant on the ICC moving the Champions Trophy out of Pakistan. The article will analyze and highlight the reasons behind India's stance and shed light on the matter.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. India's call for moving the Champions Trophy out of Pakistan is justifiable.</p>
  <p>2. Pakistan's security record for international cricket tournaments is questionable.</p>
  <p>3. India's experience and track record of hosting international tournaments make it an ideal backup venue.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>/ Case Studies</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Recently retired Indian cricketer Irfan Pathan weighed in his views on India's stance, stating that he empathizes with the players who will travel there and play. In 2009, the Sri Lankan cricket team was attacked in Lahore, Pakistan, and last year, the visiting New Zealand cricket team had to call off their tour midway due to security concerns.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Practical Tips</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>India's success in hosting international tournaments can serve as a blueprint for other countries to follow while hosting international events. A comprehensive security plan and a robust code of conduct are necessary to ensure players' safety and compete at the highest level.</p>
