The board has improved the security measures at the cricket grounds, and the success of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) has given the world a glimpse of the passion and enthusiasm of the Pakistani crowd for the game.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The ICC's decision to play the Champions Trophy in Pakistan is not only a great win for the country, but it is also a significant boost for the game of cricket as a whole. Cricket is a religion in South Asia, and Pakistan is one of the most passionate nations when it comes to the sport.</p>
  <p></p>

It will generate revenue for the PCB and the local businesses, and it will also create job opportunities. The influx of international cricket will also inspire the next generation of cricketers in Pakistan, and it will help in the growth and development of the game.</p>
