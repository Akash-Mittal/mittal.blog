   <p>Peacekeeping has become an essential part of the United Nations' effort to maintain international peace and security. As a proud member of the UN, Pakistan has been contributing to peacekeeping missions for over 60 years.</p>
   
   <p>One of Pakistan's most notable contributions to UN peacekeeping was during the 1995 Rwandan Genocide. Pakistani peacekeepers, under the leadership of General Romeo Dallaire, were one of the few forces who remained in Rwanda during the genocide. They shielded and protected civilians, and despite being outnumbered and outgunned, helped to save thousands of lives.</p>
   <p>General Dallaire, in his book "Shake Hands with the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda," praised the Pakistani peacekeepers, stating that "the Pakistani soldiers gave me hope, when all around me there was none."</p>
   
   <p>Pakistan has been consistently ranked as one of the top troop-contributing countries to UN peacekeeping missions:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>As of October 2021, Pakistan is the fifth-largest contributor of uniformed personnel to UN peacekeeping missions, with a total of 5,608 troops deployed.</li>
    <li>Since 1960, Pakistan has sent over 200,000 peacekeepers to 46 different missions around the world.</li>
    <li>In 2018, Pakistani peacekeepers were awarded the prestigious UN Medal for their role in improving security and facilitating the delivery of humanitarian aid in conflict-affected regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</li>
    <li>Pakistani peacekeepers have also played a key role in the fight against Ebola, with over 1,200 personnel deployed to Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea between 2014 and 2016.</li>
   </ul>
   
   <p>I have had the privilege of meeting with Pakistani peacekeepers and hearing firsthand about their experiences in the field. I was deeply moved by the stories they shared, and by their unwavering commitment to the cause of peace.</p>
   <p>One peacekeeper in particular stood out to me. His name was Major Tariq Khan, and he had served on multiple peacekeeping missions in Africa and the Middle East. He shared with me his belief that peacekeeping is not just about military might, but also about building relationships and fostering trust with local communities.</p>
