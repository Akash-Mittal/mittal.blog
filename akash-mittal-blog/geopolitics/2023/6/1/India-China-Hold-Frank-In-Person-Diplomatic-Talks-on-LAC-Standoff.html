   <p>The India-China border conflict has been ongoing since May 2020, with both sides accusing each other of intruding into their respective territories and violating the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The situation escalated further with the border clash in Galwan Valley on June 15, 2020, in which 20 Indian soldiers lost their lives, and an unknown number of Chinese casualties were reported.</p>
   <p>The tension between the two nations has led to a buildup of troops and weapons on both sides of the border, causing concern among the international community. The United States and other countries have called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict, urging both India and China to engage in talks to de-escalate the situation.</p>
   <p>After several rounds of military and diplomatic talks, India and China have finally held frank in-person diplomatic talks in Moscow on September 10, 2020, between India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi.</p>
   <p>The talks lasted for more than two hours, where both sides expressed their concerns and views over the border issue. According to reports, India conveyed its strong protest against China's provocative behavior along the LAC, while China accused India of illegally trespassing on its territory and committing "serious provocation". However, both sides agreed to resolve the issue through peaceful means and dialogue.</p>
   <p>The meeting between the two foreign ministers sends a positive signal, indicating that the two nations are willing to engage in peaceful talks to resolve the border conflict.</p>
   
   <p>According to sources, both India and China have deployed thousands of troops and heavy artillery near the disputed region, which has led to a tense standoff between the two nations. The military buildup has caused concern among the international community, including the United States, Japan, and Australia, who have called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.</p>
   <p>The situation has also affected trade between the two nations, with India putting restrictions on Chinese imports and banning Chinese apps such as TikTok and WeChat. China has also imposed retaliatory measures, affecting Indian businesses and investments in China.</p>
   <p>The India-China conflict has not only affected the two nations but also has regional and global implications. The rising tensions between the two nations could potentially lead to a larger conflict, drawing in other countries and disrupting the world economy.</p>
   <h2></h2>
   <p class="conclusion">In conclusion, the India-China border conflict is a matter of concern for the international community. The recent in-person talks between the two foreign ministers indicate that both nations are willing to engage in peaceful dialogue to resolve the issue. Here are the three key takeaways from the talks:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>The talks send a positive signal and indicate a willingness to resolve the issue through peaceful means and dialogue.</li>
    <li>The situation has regional and global implications, and a peaceful resolution is in the interest of both nations and the international community.</li>
    <li>The talks are the first step towards de-escalation, and more such talks are needed to resolve the border conflict and restore peace and stability in the region.</li>
