  <h1>EU Pushes Alternative Model to China in Global Race for Raw Materials</h1> <img src="images/EU-Pushes-Alternative-Model-to-China-in-Global-Race-for-Raw-Materials.jpeg" alt="+EU-Pushes-Alternative-Model-to-China-in-Global-Race-for-Raw-Materials+">
  <p></p>
  <p>In recent years, the global competition for raw materials has intensified, with China emerging as a dominant player. The EU, however, is taking a different approach. Rather than relying solely on imports, it is developing a new model that prioritizes sustainability, circular economy, and local sourcing. This alternative model promises to not only secure the EU's access to vital raw materials, but also deliver environmental and social benefits.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>A Story of Innovation and Collaboration</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In 2013, the European Commission launched the Raw Materials Initiative, aimed at securing reliable and sustainable access to raw materials for the EU. One of the key pillars of the initiative is innovation in the field of raw materials, which includes finding new ways to extract, process, and use them.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One such innovation is the Circular Economy Action Plan, which proposes a shift from a linear "take-make-dispose" model to a circular one that minimizes waste and maximizes resource efficiency. This would reduce the EU's dependence on imports and boost its competitiveness.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another innovation is the European Battery Alliance, which seeks to develop a home-grown battery industry that can compete with China and other global players. This collaboration between the public and private sector aims to pool resources and expertise to develop a sustainable and secure supply chain for battery raw materials.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable Examples</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The EU's alternative model is already paying dividends. According to a report by the European Commission, the EU is now the world's largest producer of refined nickel, accounting for 41% of global production. It is also the second largest producer of refined copper, with a 17% share of global production.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Moreover, the EU is making progress in recycling and recovering critical raw materials, such as cobalt, lithium, and rare earth elements, which are used in many high-tech applications. For example, the EU is currently recycling only 5% of its lithium-ion batteries, but this is expected to increase to 35% by 2025, thanks to new regulations and investments.</p>
  <p></p>

  <p>EU's Alternative Model: A Sustainable and Circular Approach to the Global Race for Raw Materials</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. The global competition for raw materials is intensifying, but the EU is taking a new approach that prioritizes sustainability, circular economy, and local sourcing.</p>
  <p>2. The EU's alternative model is already delivering environmental and social benefits, as well as securing its access to vital raw materials.</p>
  <p>3. Innovation and collaboration, such as the Circular Economy Action Plan and the European Battery Alliance, are key to the success of the EU's alternative model.</p>
