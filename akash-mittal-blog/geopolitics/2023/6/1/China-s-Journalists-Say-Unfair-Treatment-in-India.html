    <p>It was a bright Monday morning in June when Li Mei, a journalist with China Daily, was denied entry into India. She had already applied for a visa and was looking forward to reporting on India's growing economic ties with China.

    <p>Li Mei's case is not unique. Many Chinese journalists have reported facing similar challenges while trying to report from India.
