   <p>India and China held in-person diplomatic talks in New Delhi after months of tension and military build-up at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Eastern Ladakh.

   <p>The border dispute between India and China in Eastern Ladakh began in May 2020 when both countries accused each other of violating the LAC. This led to a military stand-off between the two countries with troops from both sides facing each other at several points along the LAC. The situation had escalated to the point where both countries had deployed thousands of troops, tanks, and artillery guns along the border.</p>
   <p>After several rounds of talks at the military and diplomatic level, both countries had agreed to disengage their troops from Pangong Tso, one of the major flashpoints in the border dispute. This was seen as a positive step towards resolving the border impasse, but tensions remained high as both countries continue to hold a large number of troops and military equipment along the LAC.</p>
   <p>The in-person diplomatic talks in New Delhi were seen as a crucial step towards finding a permanent solution to the border dispute. The talks were held amidst strict COVID-19 protocols with the foreign secretary of India and China discussing several issues related to the border dispute. Both countries expressed their commitment to resolving the issue peacefully through dialogue and consultation.</p>
