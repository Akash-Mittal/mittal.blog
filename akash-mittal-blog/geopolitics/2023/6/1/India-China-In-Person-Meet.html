    <h4>An Interesting Story</h4>
    <p>India and China, the two largest nations in the world, share a long history together. However, their relationship has not always been cordial. In recent years, tension has been brewing between the two countries along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Himalayan mountains.</p>
    <p>Last year, a violent clash between the Indian and Chinese forces in Galwan Valley resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers and an unknown number of Chinese troops. This marked the first such incident in over 45 years. Tensions have been high ever since, with both sides engaging in military build-up and strategic maneuvers.</p>
    <p>However, in a historic move, India recently hosted China for an in-person meeting to discuss the ongoing border dispute. This move is seen as a positive sign towards resolving the conflict and improving the bilateral relationship between the two countries.</p>

    <h4>Quantifiable Examples</h4>
    <p>The LAC conflict has taken a toll on both countries' economies. India-China trade relations have been negatively affected, with the total trade between the two countries seeing a decrease of 18.63% in 2020. For instance, in April 2020, India banned Chinese investment in Indian companies to reduce dependence on China and reduce trade deficit.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the geographical proximity of the two nations and the sizable military presence along the LAC increases the risk of future conflicts that could escalate to a full-blown war. Hence, resolving the border dispute is crucial for both countries to maintain regional peace and stability.</p>
