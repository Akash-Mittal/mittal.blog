  <p>Meet Julie, a frozen food enthusiast who enjoys keeping her freezer stocked with various types of frozen products. Recently, she heard that the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) was conducting a review of several frozen products to determine whether to continue imposing anti-dumping and countervailing duties on them. Concerned about the impact that this might have on her favorite frozen products, Julie decided to do some research. In this article, we will highlight what Julie found out about USITC's determinations on frozen products in five year sunset reviews.</p>

  <p>Quantifiable Examples:</p>
  <p>According to USITC's determinations, certain types of frozen fruits, vegetables and seafood from several countries have been found to be causing injury to the US industry and continue to be subject to anti-dumping and countervailing duties.

As a result, USITC countries to continue imposing anti-dumping duties on imported Chinese crawfish for another five years.
