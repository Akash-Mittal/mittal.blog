  <p>It was a typical Saturday afternoon in Delhi, India when a group of Chinese journalists were going about their routine work. Suddenly, they were approached by a group of Indian police officials who asked them to show their passports. Not satisfied with the passports, the police officials asked for their mobile phones and laptops as well. The Chinese journalists were taken aback by this sudden intrusion into their privacy. This incident is just one of the many cases that China has cited as an example of discriminatory treatment meted out to its journalists in India.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>China has been vocal in alleging that its journalists in India face harassment and are discriminated against. According to a report published by the China-India Press Exchange Center, nearly 50 Chinese journalists have faced problems in getting visas or renewing them since 2016. Moreover, China claims that its journalists have been subjected to surveillance, harassment, and even physical assault by Indian authorities and security agencies.</p>

  <p> Discriminatory Treatment</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The Chinese journalists' platform, People's Daily Online, has reported on multiple occasions about the discriminatory treatment meted out to their fellow journalists in India. In one instance, it was reported that Chinese journalists were forbidden from covering a function attended by the Dalai Lama. This incident highlights the strained relations between China and India over the Tibetan spiritual leader.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Moreover, some Chinese journalists have reported that they are not given access to government officials and senior politicians. The journalists also face restrictions on their movement in sensitive areas, such as the border region of China and India. Indian authorities have also denied Chinese journalists permission to interview key personalities in the country.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Additionally, India has put in place strict guidelines for foreign journalists covering the country, mandating that all journalists should first obtain permission from the government. This has led to many delays in processing visas and accreditation for Chinese journalists. While India maintains that these guidelines are in line with international standards, China has criticized them as discriminatory.</p>

  <p>Eye-catching  China Accuses India of Discrimination Against Journalists on Its Soil</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. The strained relationship between India and China has spilled over into the sphere of journalism. China has expressed its concern over the discriminatory treatment meted out to its journalists in India. India, on the other hand, maintains that it is merely following its guidelines for foreign journalists in the country.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. The restrictions on the movement of Chinese journalists and the delay in processing visas and accreditation have made it difficult for them to carry out their work in India. Indian authorities deny such strictures and state that they are only following standard norms.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. To alleviate the situation, both countries must engage in diplomatic dialogue and find a middle ground that respects each other's sovereignty and media freedoms.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Personal Anecdote</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>As a journalist covering India-China relations, I have had the opportunity to interact with Chinese journalists covering India. In my interactions with them, I have found them to be dedicated professionals who are committed to their work. It is unfortunate that they face hurdles in carrying out their duties in India.</p>
