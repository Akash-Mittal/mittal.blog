  <p>It was the winter of 2013 when Tenzin Wangmo along with her husband and two children decided to migrate to India. Tenzin hails from Tsewang Village in Chumar Sector along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh, where the current India-China standoff is taking place. Her village lies on the India-China border where the Indian Army had secured its position in 1962. Tenzin, a farmer, had lost her cattle, livelihood, and property to the Chinese incursion that year. She had fought and won back her ancestral land from the Chinese in a legal battle in the early 2010s. Tenzin is still hopeful that she will get justice, and the Chinese will finally vacate her land.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The current standoff between India and China along the LAC is the most serious in decades, and the biggest challenge in the bilateral relationship. The stand-off that began in May 2020 between Indian and Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley turned violent, and there were casualties on both sides. Since then, the two sides have been trying to negotiate for disengagement and removing the military build-up from the border.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>While the diplomatic engagement has been going on, the situation on the ground remains volatile. There has been no breakthrough in talks between the two countries, and the troops remain deployed, waiting for orders. Meanwhile, the winter has set in, and the temperatures in the high-altitude region are dipping to minus 40 degrees Celsius, making the situation worse.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The India-China standoff has raised concerns globally, as both countries are nuclear-armed, and the tension on the border could trigger a full-scale war. The situation has also affected the lives of people living along the LAC, who face the threat of displacement and loss of livelihood.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Proposals for Disengagement</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>To resolve the standoff, multiple proposals have been made by experts and policymakers. Here are a few proposals that can be considered for disengagement along the LAC:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Negotiation at the Military Level:</p>
  <p>The two countries should engage in a negotiation at the military level to de-escalate the tension and disengage the troops. The military talks have been going on, but there has been no significant outcome. The two sides have to find a middle ground, restore the status quo as of April 2020, and pull back their troops.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Confidence-Building Measures:</p>
  <p>The two countries can take confidence-building measures to reduce the tension along the LAC. These measures can include pulling back heavy equipment, reducing military exercises on the border, and avoiding patrolling in the sensitive areas. The CBMs can help build trust between the two sides and reduce the probability of a conflict.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Third-Party Mediation:</p>
  <p>The two countries can consider third-party mediation to resolve the standoff. The UN or a neutral country can act as a mediator between India and China. The mediator can help bridge the gap between the two sides and offer a solution that is acceptable to both. However, this proposal has not been accepted by either of the two countries.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The standoff between India and China has affected the lives of people along the LAC, and the situation remains volatile. The two countries have to find a solution to the problem because the escalation of tension could lead to a war. The above proposals can help de-escalate the tension and disengage the troops along the LAC. India and China have to show flexibility, engage in constructive dialogue, and find common ground to resolve the issue.</p>
