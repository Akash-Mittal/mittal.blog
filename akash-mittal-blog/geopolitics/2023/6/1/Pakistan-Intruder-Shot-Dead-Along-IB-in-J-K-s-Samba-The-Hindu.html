  <h1>An Intriguing Incidence - Pakistan Intruder Shot Dead Along IB in J K's Samba</h1> <img src="images/Pakistan-Intruder-Shot-Dead-Along-IB-in-J-K-s-Samba-The-Hindu.jpeg" alt="+Pakistan-Intruder-Shot-Dead-Along-IB-in-J-K-s-Samba-The-Hindu+">
  <p>It was a typical evening for the security personnel at the International Border (IB) in Jammu and Kashmir's Samba district. They were patrolling around, keeping an eye on every suspicious activity. Suddenly, they spotted a man trying to cross the border from the Pakistani side. Without a second thought, they challenged him and asked him to stop. However, the man ignored the warning and kept moving towards them. In response, the security personnel had to open gunfire, which ultimately led to his death.</p>
  <p>Instances like these are not uncommon in Jammu and Kashmir, which has been facing cross-border terrorism for decades now. However, in recent years, there has been a decrease in such activities. According to data published by the Ministry of Home Affairs, while there were 2,518 incidents of cross-border terrorism in 2002, it reduced to 168 in 2020, showing a significant decline.</p>
  
  <p>One of the essential reasons for the decline is the measures taken by the security forces. For instance -</p>
  <ul>
   <li>In 2016, the Indian Army conducted a surgical strike on militant camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) in response to the Uri terror attack.</li>
   <li>In 2019, the Indian Air Force carried out air strikes on a Jaish-e-Mohammed camp in Balakot, Pakistan, as a retaliation of the Pulwama terror attack.</li>
   <li>The Indian government also revoked Article 370, which gave Special Status to Jammu and Kashmir and passed the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Act, bifurcating the state into two Union Territories - Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. This led to the removal of several hurdles in the development of the region, leading to people being more inclined towards peace and prosperity.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These measures not only took a strict stand on terrorism but also showed the world that India is not going to tolerate it anymore. It has played a significant role in neutralizing terrorist activities and promoting tranquillity in the region.</p>
  <h2>An  - The Threat That Lurks Beyond the Borders - The Hindu</h2>
  <p>The title emphasizes the fact that the security forces in Jammu and Kashmir are always on high alert, as they never know when and where the threat will emerge. It also defines that the threat not only comes from within but also from beyond the borders, indicating cross-border terrorism.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion in Three Points</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>The decline in cross-border terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir can be attributed to several reasons, such as surgical strikes, air strikes, and revocation of Article 370.</li>
   <li>The security forces have been vigilant in keeping the borders safe, and they have succeeded in doing that to a large extent. They always keep an eye out for any suspicious activities and respond with armed force when necessary.</li>
   <li>Jammu and Kashmir is a beautiful region with immense potential for development. The government and the people are working hard to create a peaceful and prosperous environment for everyone to live in.</li>
  </ol>
