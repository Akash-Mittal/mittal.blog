  <h1>India and China Hold First In-Person Meeting Since LAC Flare-Up</h1> <img src="images/India-and-China-Hold-First-In-Person-Meeting-Since-LAC-Flare-Up.jpeg" alt="+India-and-China-Hold-First-In-Person-Meeting-Since-LAC-Flare-Up+">
  <p>It was a warm summer evening when I first met Mr. Wang, a Chinese businessman, at a networking event in Delhi. He was curious about India and our rich culture, and we hit it off immediately. Over drinks, he asked me if I knew anything about the ongoing tensions between India and China.</p>
  <p>Little did we know that our conversation was a microcosm of the broader relations between our countries. India and China have had a strained relationship for decades, with various border disputes leading to armed conflicts. However, the recent LAC flare-up in 2020 was the worst in decades, leading to a military standoff and heightened tensions.</p>
  <p>Fortunately, there seems to be hope on the horizon. Recently, India and China held their first in-person meeting since the flare-up, raising hopes of a thaw in relations between the two nations.</p>
  <h2> Progress</h2>
  <p>The recent meeting between the foreign ministers of India and China shows that both nations are willing to engage in diplomacy and dialogue to resolve their differences. The meeting took place on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, on 14 July 2021.</p>
  <p>The meeting is significant as it is the first in-person meeting between the two sides since the military standoff in eastern Ladakh began in May 2020. While the meeting did not lead to any immediate breakthrough, it was a positive step towards resolving the ongoing tensions.</p>
  <p>Additionally, both sides have made some progress in disengaging troops and weapons from several disputed areas along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). In February 2021, India and China completed the disengagement process at the Pangong Tso lake area, which was a major flashpoint during the LAC flare-up.</p>
  <p>Moreover, both sides have expressed a desire to maintain peace and stability in the region, with Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar stating that "if there is ebb in tensions, it is because both sides have shown responsible behaviour".</p>
