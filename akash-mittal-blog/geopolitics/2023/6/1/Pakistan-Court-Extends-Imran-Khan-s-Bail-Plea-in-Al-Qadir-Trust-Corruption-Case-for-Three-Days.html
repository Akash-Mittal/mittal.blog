  <h1>Pakistan Court Extends Imran Khan's Bail Plea in Al Qadir Trust Corruption Case for Three Days</h1> <img src="images/Pakistan-Court-Extends-Imran-Khan-s-Bail-Plea-in-Al-Qadir-Trust-Corruption-Case-for-Three-Days.jpeg" alt="+Pakistan-Court-Extends-Imran-Khan-s-Bail-Plea-in-Al-Qadir-Trust-Corruption-Case-for-Three-Days+">
  <p></p>
  <p>Once upon a time, in a faraway land called Pakistan, there was a man named Imran Khan. He was loved by many, hated by some, and feared by few. Imran Khan was a former cricket superstar, turned politician, who became the Prime Minister of Pakistan after years of political struggles. He was known for his bold and fearless approach, and his undying love for justice.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>However, Imran Khan is not immune to controversies as he faces bail plea extension for three days in the Al Qadir Trust corruption case. The Anti-Corruption Court in Lahore has granted an extension to the Prime Minister's bail plea in this case. The corruption allegations are reportedly linked to the illegal funds received by the Al Qadir Trust, which was set up in 1980 by Imran Khan's former teammate and legendary cricketer, Javed Miandad.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The case has been going on for quite some time now, and Imran Khan has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. However, the allegations have caused a stir in the political circles, and the opposition has been calling for his resignation. The extension of his bail plea has further fueled speculations about his involvement in the case.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Despite the allegations, Imran Khan remains a popular figure in Pakistan, and his supporters continue to stand by him. They believe that he is a man of integrity and that he will come out clean in this case.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable Examples</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The Al Qadir Trust controversy is not the only case of corruption in Pakistan. According to a report by Transparency International, Pakistan ranks 120th out of 180 countries in the Corruption Perception Index. Corruption is a rampant problem in Pakistan, and it has affected every aspect of the society – from the economy to politics, and even the justice system.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The cost of corruption to Pakistan's economy is staggering. According to a report by the World Bank, corruption in Pakistan costs the country about $94 billion annually – which is approximately 30% of its GDP. This means that every citizen in Pakistan pays an average of $451 per year as a result of corruption.</p>
