   <p>How China's response to India's expulsion of Chinese journalists has sparked a new round of tensions between the two countries</p>
  </header>
  <div class="container">
   
   <p>In September 2020, India expelled two Chinese journalists working for state-run media companies after they were found to have violated their visa regulations. China criticized the move as unjustified and retaliated by expelling two Indian journalists based in Beijing. This was just the latest escalation in a longstanding conflict between the two countries over territorial disputes and trade imbalances.</p>
   
   <ul>
    <li>In 2019, India banned Chinese mobile apps such as TikTok and WeChat, citing national security concerns and unfair competition for Indian startups.</li>
    <li>In 2020, India began using more stringent criteria for allowing Chinese companies to invest or take part in government contracts, further limiting their participation in India's economy.</li>
    <li>In the first nine months of 2020, China's exports to India fell by 16.3% year-on-year, reflecting the impact of the pandemic and the deteriorating relationship between the two countries.</li>

   <ol>
    <li>China's response to India's expulsion of Chinese journalists shows how high tensions are between the two countries.</li>
    <li>India's actions against China, such as banning Chinese mobile apps and limiting Chinese investment, reflect its desire to protect its national interests and reduce its trade deficit with China.</li>
    <li>The conflict between China and India is likely to continue unless both sides can find a way to resolve their differences and prevent future flare-ups.</li>
