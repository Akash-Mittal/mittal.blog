  <h1><strong>The Story behind India-China High-Level Military Dialogue on Eastern Ladakh Row</strong></h1> <img src="images/The-Story-behind-India-China-High-Level-Military-Dialogue-on-Eastern-Ladakh-Row.jpeg" alt="+The-Story-behind-India-China-High-Level-Military-Dialogue-on-Eastern-Ladakh-Row+">
  <p>With the increasing tension between India and China over the eastern Ladakh row, the two countries have agreed to schedule a high-level military dialogue soon to find a solution to the ongoing conflict. This move comes after several rounds of diplomatic talks and military-level engagements failed to ease tensions.</p>
  <p>The ongoing tension between India and China started in May 2020, when China reportedly intruded into the Indian territory of Pangong Tso in eastern Ladakh. India accused China of deploying troops and construction activity across the LAC (Line of Actual Control). Though several rounds of talks have happened since then, the situation only escalated, leading to violent clashes between the two armies in June 2020, which resulted in casualties on both sides.</p>
  <p>The situation has since then remained tense, with frequent patrolling from both sides, leading to several instances of face-offs between the armies. The situation has also led to a ban on Chinese apps in India, concerns about Chinese investments in the Indian market, and calls to boycott Chinese products.</p>
  <h2><strong> the Tension between India and China</strong></h2>
  <h3><strong>Increased Patrols along the LAC</strong></h3>
  <p>The Indian and Chinese armies have increased patrolling along the LAC in Eastern Ladakh over the past year. According to reports, Indian forces have been patrolling the area in greater numbers than before to show their control over the land, which China claims as its own. These patrols have often led to confrontations between the two armies, with both sides accusing each other of violating the LAC.</p>
  <h3><strong>Face-Offs between the Armies</strong></h3>
  <p>The increased patrolling and construction activity by the Chinese army have led to several instances of face-offs with Indian troops. In May 2020, Indian and Chinese soldiers clashed in the Galwan Valley, which resulted in casualties on both sides. Since then, there have been several instances of face-offs, with both sides accusing each other of violating the LAC.</p>
  <h3><strong>Boycott of Chinese Apps, Products, and Investments</strong></h3>
  <p>The tension between the two countries has led to a ban on several Chinese apps in India, including TikTok, WeChat, and more. There have also been calls to boycott Chinese products and investments in India. Many Indians have been deleting Chinese apps and actively trying to avoid Chinese products, affecting the Chinese market and economy.</p>
