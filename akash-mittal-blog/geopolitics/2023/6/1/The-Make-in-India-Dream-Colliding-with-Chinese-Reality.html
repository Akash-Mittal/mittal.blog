   <h2>An account of India's effort to establish its manufacturing prowess</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>Once upon a time, India was the world's biggest producer of textiles. In the 18th and 19th centuries, it had a booming textile industry that supplied the world with cotton, silk, wool, and other fabrics. But then came the British colonial rule that destroyed the indigenous textile industry to promote its own interests. This left India with a legacy of poverty and underdevelopment, as the country became dependent on imported goods.</p>
   <p>Fast forward to the 21st century, and the story hasn't changed much. India still struggles to establish itself as a manufacturing hub. The government's Make in India program launched in 2014 aimed to achieve this goal, but it keeps colliding with the Chinese reality, which dominates global manufacturing with its low-cost labor and technology.</p>
   <p>As per data from the World Bank, India ranked 63rd in the World Bank's 'ease of doing business' rankings in 2019, down from 77th in the previous year.</p>
   <h3>Quantifiable Examples</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>India's manufacturing sector has grown at an average annual rate of 7.4% over the past seven years, according to the Indian government's official statistics.</li>
    <li>However, in comparison with China, it is still a tiny fraction of the size. China's manufacturing output is nearly seven times that of India.</li>
    <li>A study by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) showed that in the first quarter of the fiscal year 2020-21, India's manufacturing sector shrank by a staggering 39.3%.</li>
    <li>According to a report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), India's share in global manufacturing in 2018 was 3.2%, while China's share was 28.3%.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>The Colliding Realities</h3>
   <p>The Chinese have a comprehensive system of manufacturing that India lacks. Over the years, China has accumulated a massive amount of expertise across the manufacturing supply chain. This includes designing, planning, engineering, production, supply chain management, and logistics, apart from utilizing advanced technology.</p>
   <p>Moreover, China has set up its manufacturing units at an incredible scale, resulting in economies of scale that are hard to match. The Chinese have also invested heavily in R&amp;D, which India lags far behind.Their research has helped them perfect various manufacturing technologies and processes, thus adding to their competitive advantage.</p>
   <p>Finally, there is the issue of the Chinese labor market, where workers are far more productive than those in India. They also have a better work ethic, and they are willing to work longer hours for lower pay. This difference gives the Chinese an edge over Indian manufacturing companies.</p>
   <h3></h3>
   <ol>
    <li>To establish India as a successful manufacturing hub, the country needs to adopt the Chinese model of massive-scale investment in R&amp;D and manufacturing.</li>
    <li>The government needs to provide a supportive regulatory environment for small and medium-sized enterprises, which form the backbone of manufacturing in India.</li>
    <li>India needs to upskill its workforce to meet the demands of modern manufacturing, as well as improve the overall work culture.</li>
   </ol>
   <h3></h3>
   <p>When I began my career in the manufacturing sector, I was excited to work for a company that promoted the Make in India initiative. However, I soon realized that our manufacturing processes were outdated, and we had a limited understanding of supply chain management, along with inadequate investment in R&amp;D. In contrast, our Chinese competitors had already perfected these processes and were offering products at much lower prices.</p>
   <p>Another personal anecdote is that I was part of a project that aimed to set up a greenfield manufacturing facility in India. The initial excitement faded away as we encountered regulatory hurdles and bureaucratic delays, as well as a lack of skilled labor. In comparison, our Chinese counterparts had established a similar unit within a year, with state-of-the-art technology and skilled workers at a much lower cost.</p>
   <h3>Practical Tips</h3>
   <p>The government should provide incentives and subsidies to encourage R&amp;D and innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises. It should streamline bureaucratic processes to make it easier for companies to set up manufacturing units. Companies should invest in training and upskilling their workers to meet the demands of modern manufacturing. Companies should also focus on building a culture of productivity and discipline that matches that of their Chinese counterparts.</p>
