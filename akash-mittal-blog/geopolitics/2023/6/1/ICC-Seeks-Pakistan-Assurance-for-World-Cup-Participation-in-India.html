   <h2>Story</h2>
   <p>The International Cricket Council (ICC) is reportedly seeking assurance from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that the country's team will participate in the upcoming World Cup which is scheduled to be held in India. The concern arises due to the diplomatic tension between the two neighboring countries, which has resulted in India refusing to grant visas to Pakistani athletes and officials for various sporting events hosted in the country.</p>
   
   <ul>
    <li>In 2019, the Indian government refused visas to the Pakistani cricket team for the World Cup Qualifiers held in India.</li>
    <li>In 2020, Pakistan withdrew from the Kabaddi World Cup hosted in India citing security reasons.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Why Pakistan's Participation is Important</h2>
   <p>Pakistan is a significant cricketing nation, and its absence from the World Cup will not only lead to a loss of revenue for the ICC but also adversely affect the tournament's overall competitiveness. With a passionate fan base and a storied cricketing tradition, Pakistan's participation is vital for the success of the World Cup.</p>
   <h2>ICC's Efforts</h2>
   <p>The ICC has taken notice of the issue and has begun talks with the PCB to ensure the country's participation in the tournament. The organization's CEO, Manu Sawhney, has reportedly reached out to the Indian government, urging them to grant visas to the Pakistani cricket team. The ICC has also stated that it will bear the cost of all security arrangements for the Pakistani team during the tournament if required.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, the World Cup, which is scheduled to be held in India in 2021, faces uncertainty over Pakistan's participation due to political tensions between the two countries. The ICC, recognizing the gravity of the situation, has begun talks with the PCB and is making efforts to ensure Pakistan's participation in the tournament. The ICC CEO has reached out to the Indian government to grant visas to the Pakistani cricket team, and the organization has offered to provide all the necessary security arrangements for the Pakistani team during the tournament. The World Cup without Pakistan would be significantly weaker, and cricket enthusiasts around the world look forward to seeing Pakistan play in the tournament.</p>
