    <p class="intro">Imagine a foreign power gaining control of American companies critical to our national security. It sounds like the plot of a spy thriller, but it's a real threat the United States faces today. Amid fears of Chinese influence, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has taken measures to protect our country from hostile foreign takeovers.</p>
    <p>CFIUS is an interagency committee of the U.S. government that reviews foreign investment in the United States and makes recommendations to the President regarding national security concerns. In recent years, CFIUS has become increasingly focused on Chinese investment, which has been growing rapidly in the United States.</p>
    <ul>
     <li>In 2015, Chinese investors put $15.7 billion into the United States, more than triple the amount invested in 2010.</li>
     <li>In 2016, Chinese buyers spent a record $46 billion on U.S. assets, including high-profile acquisitions such as the Waldorf Astoria hotel and the Chicago Stock Exchange.</li>
     <li>In 2017, Chinese investment in the United States dropped for the first time in more than a decade as Chinese regulators pulled back on overseas deals.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Despite the recent decline, Chinese investment in the United States remains a significant concern for CFIUS. Here are three ways the committee is working to counter Chinese influence:</p>
    <h2>1. Tightening Regulations</h2>
    <p>CFIUS has the power to block foreign investment in the United States if it poses a national security risk. In 2018, Congress passed legislation expanding CFIUS's powers to review a broader range of investments, including those involving critical technology and infrastructure. The new law also gives CFIUS expanded authority to scrutinize real estate transactions near military installations.</p>
    <p>These changes reflect growing concerns about Chinese investment in American technology companies, which could give China access to critical national security information. In 2018, CFIUS forced Chinese tech company Kunlun to sell gay dating app Grindr, which it had acquired in 2016, citing national security concerns.</p>
    <h2>2. Engaging with Allies</h2>
    <p>CFIUS is not just concerned about Chinese investment in the United States – it's worried about China's global ambitions. To counter those ambitions, CFIUS is working with other governments to ensure that Chinese companies don't gain control of critical infrastructure overseas.</p>
    <p>In 2018, CFIUS worked with Australia to block the sale of Australian company APA Group to Hong Kong-based CK Infrastructure, citing national security concerns. CFIUS also worked with European governments to prevent Chinese telecom companies from gaining a foothold in the continent's 5G networks.</p>
    <h2>3. Raising Awareness</h2>
    <p>CFIUS is not just focused on blocking specific investments – it's also raising awareness about the threat of Chinese influence. The committee has been holding outreach events around the country to educate businesses and academic institutions about the risks posed by Chinese investment. CFIUS has also released a fact sheet for small businesses outlining the ways in which foreign investment can pose a national security threat.</p>
    <p>In addition to these measures, CFIUS is working to improve its own operations, including streamlining the review process and increasing the resources it has available to conduct investigations.</p>
    <p>Despite these efforts, the threat of Chinese influence remains a complex and evolving challenge for the United States. But with the work of CFIUS and other government agencies, the country is taking steps to protect itself against malicious foreign actors.</p>
