   <p>According to a recent report by UBS, the multinational investment bank, the current global geopolitical climate is the top concern for Asia family offices. The second and third largest concerns were noted as market volatility and geopolitics in Asia, respectively.</p>
   <p>This report is based on a survey of 70 family offices across Asia. The results show that these offices are increasingly worried about how the global geopolitical climate will impact their investments. This includes concerns about rising tensions between the US and China, as well as the unpredictability of other global actors such as North Korea, Russia, and the Middle East.</p>
   <p>These worries are not surprising given the current state of the world. However, what is interesting is the potential impact this could have on investment strategies. Family offices are taking an increasingly cautious approach, with a focus on diversification and risk management. For example, some are looking to alternative investments such as private equity and real estate to mitigate risk while still achieving growth.</p>
   <p>One example of a family office that is taking this approach is the Chinachem Group, a Hong Kong-based property development firm. According to a recent interview with the South China Morning Post, the company plans to expand its real estate portfolio in Europe over the next few years. This move is seen as a way to diversify their investments and mitigate the risks associated with the current geopolitical climate.</p>
   <p>Another example comes from the Taipei-based Cathay Financial Holdings, which has increased its holdings of private equity and real estate as a result of concerns about market volatility. According to a recent interview with the Taiwan News, the company is also looking to expand its alternative investments into areas such as infrastructure and renewable energy.</p>
   <p>These examples illustrate the current trend of family offices looking for ways to balance growth potential with risk management. While geopolitical concerns are certainly causing worry, it is also serving as a motivator for these offices to seek out innovative investment strategies that can help weather uncertain times.</p>
