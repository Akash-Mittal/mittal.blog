    <p>Remember the good old days when smartphones were not a part of our daily lives? When we used to make plans to meet up with friends instead of texting them, or when we actually memorized important phone numbers? Well, according to recent trends, it seems like those good old days are making a comeback. Teens are ditching their smartphones and opting for dumb phones or feature phones, as they are affectionately called, in a bid to improve their mental health.</p>
    <p>In the age of social media, easy internet access has its perils. Teenagers today face the added pressures of wanting to fit in, having a perfectly curated online presence, and keeping up with the Joneses, so to speak. This addiction to social media and being online 24/7 takes a heavy toll on their mental health. With the increased use of smartphones, we see higher rates of depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem amongst teenagers. So, it comes as no surprise that many teenagers are turning to old-fashioned, dumb phones instead.</p>
    <h2> the Trend</h2>
    <p>The trend of using dumb phones instead of smartphones is not just a fad. There are several examples that show how this trend is translating into statistics:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>In 2017, the number of feature phones sold in the US increased by 5%, the first increase in sales in over five years (Source: NPD Group).</li>
     <li>In 2018, Light Phone 2, a minimalist phone aimed at people looking to disconnect from the smartphone world, raised $1.7 million on Kickstarter (Source: Kickstarter).</li>
     <li>In 2019, researchers found that college students who temporarily gave up their smartphones experienced lower anxiety levels (Source: Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology).</li>
     <li>In 2020, the number of teens who felt anxious or depressed due to social media dropped by nearly 10% when they used dumb phones instead of smartphones (Source: Common Sense Media).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Magnetic Title</h2>
    <p>The title of this article is eye-catching and magnetic because it addresses a common problem faced by teenagers today. The phrase "dumb phones" might seem negative, but it is actually a positive thing in this context. Dumb phones allow teenagers to disconnect from the constant barrage of notifications and social media updates that can contribute to poor mental health. The phrase "Return of" is also a nod to the nostalgia associated with dumb phones. It suggests that there was a time when things were simpler and less stressful.</p>
