     <p>It was a bright sunny day in Lahore when I heard the news that India has invited Pakistan to play in India during the World Cup 2023. As a cricket enthusiast, I knew this was going to be an exciting match, but as a Pakistani, I also knew the tensions between the two countries could make it difficult for the Pakistani team to play in India.</p>
     <p>The PCB, Pakistan's cricketing governing body, was quick to respond to the invitation, stating that they were ready to play India in India during the World Cup 2023. However, they also had a request for the ICC, the international governing body of cricket - that the venue should be shifted to a neutral country.</p>
     <p>PCB's request may seem justified considering the history of tensions between the two countries, but is it really a practical solution?</p>
     
     <p>Let's take a look at some quantifiable examples to understand why PCB's request may not be the best solution:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>The viewership for India vs Pakistan matches during the World Cup is one of the highest - In fact, the match between the two countries during the World Cup 2019 had an estimated audience of 1.5 billion worldwide.</li>
      <li>The revenue generated from the match between the two countries during the World Cup is immense - In 2019, the revenue generated from the India vs Pakistan match during the World Cup was estimated to be around $400 million.</li>
      <li>Players from both teams have often expressed their desire to play against each other in an India-Pakistan match. These are memories that stay with them for a lifetime.</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>PCB's Request Not a Practical Solution</h2>
     <p>While PCB's request may seem valid considering the tense political relations between the two countries, it is not a practical solution for the following reasons:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>The World Cup 2023 is being hosted by India, and moving the venue due to one match may not be feasible.</li>
      <li>The cricketing fraternity should not be affected by the political tensions between the two countries.</li>
      <li>The match between India and Pakistan during the World Cup is a celebration of the sport and the players from both teams.</li>
     </ol>
     <h2>Conclusion</h2>
     <p>Given the excitement and hype surrounding an India vs Pakistan match during the World Cup, moving the venue to a neutral country may not be the best solution. Instead, the political tensions between the two countries should not be allowed to affect the sport and the players. The match should go on, as it is a celebration of the sport and the players from both teams.</p>
