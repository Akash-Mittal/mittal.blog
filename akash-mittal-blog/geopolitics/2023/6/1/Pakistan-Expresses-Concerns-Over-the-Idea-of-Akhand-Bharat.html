  <p></p>
  <p>Pakistan and India share a long and tumultuous history, one that is marked by wars, border disputes, and a deep-rooted sense of animosity. In recent times, the idea of Akhand Bharat, a unified India that includes Pakistan and other neighbouring countries, has gained momentum within India. This has sparked concerns in Pakistan about the implications of such an idea and its impact on the region's stability.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The Origins of Akhand Bharat</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The idea of Akhand Bharat, or undivided India, is not a new one. It has its roots in the Hindu nationalist movement, which emerged in the early 20th century in response to the British colonial rule. The movement, which is largely centred around the idea of a Hindu Rashtra (Hindu nation), seeks to revive India's ancient Hindu culture and traditions and to create a nation that is culturally and religiously homogenous.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The idea of Akhand Bharat gained prominence in the 1950s and 60s, during the aftermath of India's independence and partition. The notion of a divided India, with Pakistan carved out as a separate Muslim-majority state, was seen as a betrayal of India's territorial and cultural integrity. This belief was compounded by the fact that the partition resulted in widespread violence, displacement, and loss of life on both sides of the border.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In recent years, the idea of Akhand Bharat has seen a resurgence, particularly among the Hindu nationalist groups and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The party's leader, Narendra Modi, has openly spoken about his vision of a unified India, which includes Pakistan and other neighbouring countries.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Implications for Pakistan</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The idea of Akhand Bharat has sparked concerns in Pakistan about the implications of such an idea for the region's stability. There are several reasons for this.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Firstly, Pakistan was created as a separate state for the Muslim-majority areas of British India, and its creation was based on the belief that Muslims and Hindus could not coexist within a single unified state. If India were to become unified again, it would raise questions about the status and legitimacy of Pakistan as a separate state.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Secondly, the idea of Akhand Bharat is largely promoted by Hindu nationalist groups, who have a history of anti-Muslim and anti-Pakistan sentiment. These groups have been responsible for several acts of violence against Muslims in India, including the 2002 Gujarat riots, in which over 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed. The prospect of these groups gaining more power and influence in a unified India is a cause for concern for Pakistan.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Thirdly, the potential merger of Pakistan into Akhand Bharat would have significant implications for the Kashmir dispute. The disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir is currently divided between India and Pakistan, and both countries claim it in its entirety. The integration of Pakistan into India would mean that the Indian claim to Kashmir would become stronger, and it may lead to increased tensions and conflict in the region.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable Examples</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The concerns raised by Pakistan are not baseless. There have been several instances in recent years that highlight the growing hostility between the two countries and the implications of the idea of Akhand Bharat.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In 2019, the Indian government revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, which had given the region a degree of autonomy. This move was accompanied by a crackdown on political dissent and civil liberties in the region. Pakistan accused India of violating international law and threatening regional stability.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In February 2019, a suicide bomber attacked an Indian military convoy in Indian-administered Kashmir, killing over 40 soldiers. India responded with airstrikes against alleged terrorist camps in Pakistan, and both countries engaged in a military standoff. The situation was resolved after intense diplomatic efforts by other countries, but it highlights the fragility of the relationship between the two countries.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In August 2020, India and China engaged in a military standoff in the disputed region of Ladakh. Pakistan expressed concern about the escalation of tensions in the region and the potential impact on regional stability.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The idea of Akhand Bharat is a contentious one, and it has the potential to exacerbate the already fragile relationship between India and Pakistan. Pakistan's concerns about the implications of such an idea for the region's stability are valid and need to be taken seriously.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, the following key points need to be emphasised:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>- The idea of Akhand Bharat has its roots in the Hindu nationalist movement and seeks to create a culturally and religiously homogenous India.</p>
  <p>- The idea has gained momentum in recent years, particularly among Hindu nationalist groups and the ruling BJP.</p>
  <p>- Pakistan's concerns about the implications of such an idea for the region's stability are valid and need to be taken seriously.</p>
  <p>- The potential merger of Pakistan into Akhand Bharat would have significant implications for the Kashmir dispute.</p>
  <p>- The hostility between India and Pakistan is a cause for concern for the region.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p> or Case Studies</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The idea of Akhand Bharat is not just a political issue; it has personal implications for the people living in the region. A case in point is the story of a family that was separated by the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Nasir Ali, a Pakistani citizen, was born in the Indian city of Amritsar in 1935. When the partition of India took place in 1947, his family was forced to flee their home and move to Pakistan. Nasir was separated from his sister, who remained in India. He never saw her again.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Nasir's family was not alone in their suffering. The partition of India resulted in widespread violence, displacement, and loss of life on both sides of the border. The memory of that trauma still lingers in the minds of many people in the region.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Practical Tips</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Promote dialogue: It is essential to promote dialogue between India and Pakistan to address their differences and find common ground. Any effort to resolve the issues between the two countries must start with dialogue and engagement.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Foster economic cooperation: Economic cooperation can be a powerful tool to promote peace and stability in the region. The two countries should explore the possibility of greater economic cooperation and integration.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Promote people-to-people contact: People-to-people contact can help build bridges between the two countries and promote understanding and empathy. The two countries should encourage greater exchange and interaction between their citizens.</p>
