  <section>
   <p>On May 15th, 2018, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Nepalese Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli met in Nepal's capital, Kathmandu. The two leaders discussed ways to deepen cooperation between the two countries in areas such as trade, energy, and connectivity. This meeting is significant in the context of China's growing influence in the region and India's efforts to counter it.</p>
   <p>China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) aims to connect China with Europe, Asia, and Africa through a network of infrastructure projects. One of its key components is the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a $62 billion project that seeks to connect China's western province of Xinjiang with Pakistan's Gwadar port. CPEC passes through the disputed territory of Gilgit-Baltistan, which India claims as part of its territory, and has raised concerns in India about China's strategic intentions in the region.</p>
   <p>In response, India has been seeking to deepen ties with its neighbors, including Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh, through initiatives such as the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), the Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal (BBIN) initiative, and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC).</p>
