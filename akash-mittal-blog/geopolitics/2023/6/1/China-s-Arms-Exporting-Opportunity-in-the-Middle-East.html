   <p>It was a tense moment in the Middle East when the United States first announced the sale of $23 billion worth of military equipment to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2019. Reports of civilian casualties and human rights abuses in Yemen caused criticism from lawmakers and the public. However, another country saw this as an opportunity: China.</p>
   <p>China has been increasing its arms sales to the Middle East in recent years, taking advantage of a rift between the United States and some of its traditional allies in the region. The trade war between the US and China has also allowed China to gain a foothold in the Middle East defense market.</p>
   
   <p>The numbers speak for themselves. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), China is now the fifth largest arms exporter in the world, with a 6.2% share of the global arms market. Its arms exports have increased by 195% between 2010 and 2019.</p>
   <p>China's arms exports to the Middle East have also increased significantly. According to SIPRI, China's arms exports to the Middle East increased by 87% between 2010 and 2019, with Saudi Arabia being its biggest customer in the region.</p>
   <p>China has also been involved in joint ventures with Middle Eastern countries for arms production. For example, China and Saudi Arabia have established a joint venture that will produce armed drones. This move is seen as a direct competitor to the United States, which currently dominates the armed drone market.</p>
   <h2>China's Middle East Diplomacy</h2>
   <p>It's not just about the arms sales, though. China has been using its diplomatic relationships in the Middle East to also establish itself as a major player in the region. China has become a major foreign investor in countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and has also been providing economic and infrastructural support to countries in the region.</p>
   <p>China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a major part of its investment strategy in the Middle East. The BRI is a global infrastructure development program that aims to connect China with other countries through land and maritime routes. The BRI has been gaining traction in the Middle East, with many countries in the region signing up for the program.</p>
   <h2>The Importance of Middle East to China's Geo-political Interests</h2>
   <p>The Middle East is strategically important to China for several reasons. First, the Middle East is a major supplier of oil to China. Second, China sees the Middle East as a key player in its efforts to counterbalance the power of the United States. Third, the Middle East provides China with a market for its goods and services.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, China sees the Middle East as an important part of its One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative. OBOR is a development strategy that seeks to connect the economies of Asia, Europe, and Africa via land and maritime routes. The Middle East is located at the center of these routes and is therefore essential to the success of OBOR.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>As the US continues to face criticism over its arms sales to the Middle East, China has seen an opportunity to fill the gap. Its increasing arms exports to the region, combined with its diplomatic relationships and investment strategies, have allowed China to establish itself as a major player in the region. The Middle East is strategically important to China, and its efforts to strengthen its presence in the region are likely to continue in the coming years.</p>
