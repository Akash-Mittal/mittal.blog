   <p>On Monday, 9 more members of ex Pakistan PM Imran Khan's party, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), were referred to military courts to be tried under the Army Act. This comes after a series of corruption investigations and charges against members of Khan's party.</p>
   <h2> Corruption</h2>
   <p>According to a report by Transparency International, Pakistan ranks 124 out of 180 countries on the Corruption Perceptions Index. This indicates that corruption is a pervasive issue in Pakistan.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>In 2018, former PM Nawaz Sharif was sentenced to 7 years in prison on corruption charges.</li>
    <li>In 2019, former PM Shahid Khaqan Abbasi was arrested on corruption charges.</li>
    <li>In 2020, former PM Imran Khan's advisor on aviation, Sardar Mehtab Ahmad Khan, resigned amid allegations of corruption.</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>The Army Act in Pakistan</h2>
   <p>The Army Act is a law in Pakistan that allows military courts to try civilians in certain circumstances. These circumstances include terrorism, sabotage, and sedition in relation to the armed forces. This law has been controversial, with critics arguing that it erodes civilian rule and undermines the independence of the judiciary.</p>
   <p>However, supporters of the law argue that it is necessary to ensure that those who commit crimes against the armed forces are brought to justice quickly and effectively, especially in times of conflict or national emergency.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>The prevalence of corruption in Pakistan is a significant issue that has led to high-profile convictions and charges against politicians.</li>
    <li>The Army Act in Pakistan is a controversial law that allows military courts to try civilians in certain circumstances.</li>
    <li>The referral of 9 more members of the PTI to military courts highlights ongoing issues of corruption in the party and the use of the Army Act to address these issues.</li>
