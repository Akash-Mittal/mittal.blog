  <p>As the world becomes more unpredictable due to global events, container ship owners are turning to friendly countries for help. The concept of friend shoring allows container ship owners to store their goods in another country that has a good relationship with their own. This allows them to mitigate the risks of trading in an uncertain world and take advantage of new trade opportunities.</p>
  <h2>How Friend Shoring Works</h2>
  <p>Friend shoring is a simple concept. Instead of relying on a single country to store their goods, container ship owners can store their products in multiple countries. These countries are typically friendly with one another and have a good trading relationship. By storing their products in different countries, container ship owners can reduce the risks associated with unpredictable events, such as political unrest or a natural disaster.</p>
  <h2>The Benefits of Friend Shoring</h2>
  <p>Friend shoring offers a range of benefits to container ship owners. Perhaps the biggest benefit is risk mitigation. By storing products in different countries, container ship owners can reduce the risk of losing products due to trade disputes or other unexpected events. Additionally, friend shoring allows container ship owners to take advantage of new trade opportunities. If a new trade agreement is signed between two countries, container ship owners can quickly adjust their supply chain to take advantage of the new agreement.</p>
  <p>Friend shoring also offers financial benefits. By storing products in multiple countries, container ship owners can avoid costly tariffs and duties. Additionally, if a country experiences an economic downturn or currency devaluation, container ship owners can quickly move their products to a more stable country without incurring huge costs.</p>
  <h2> Friend Shoring</h2>
  <p>Friend shoring has become increasingly popular in recent years, particularly as global events create uncertainty in the world of trade. Some of the largest container ship owners have implemented friend shoring strategies to mitigate risks and take advantage of new trade opportunities. For example, Maersk Line, the world's largest container ship company, has shifted some of its supply chain to Vietnam, where it has established a major hub. This move has allowed Maersk Line to take advantage of Vietnam's growing economy and strengthen its position in Southeast Asia.</p>
  <p>Another example can be seen with the Suez Canal crisis of 2021. When the Ever Given ran aground and blocked the canal, container ship owners turned to alternate routes and friend shoring strategies. Shipping companies such as MSC and CMA CGM diverted their ships to other ports and countries. For example, CMA CGM diverted some of its ships to the Port of Durban in South Africa, where it has a strong relationship with the South African government and can quickly move its products to other African countries.</p>
  <h2>Conclusions</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, friend shoring offers a range of benefits to container ship owners, including risk mitigation and increased flexibility. As global events continue to create uncertainty in the world of trade, container ship owners are turning to friend shoring strategies to protect their supply chain and take advantage of new opportunities. In summary, the three main benefits of friend shoring are:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Risk mitigation</li>
   <li>New trade opportunities</li>
   <li>Financial benefits</li>
  </ol>
