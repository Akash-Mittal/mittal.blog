    <p>In a recent statement, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi emphasized that India cannot be pushed around by China and that the Indian government must maintain a strong stance on the country's territorial integrity and strategic interests.</p>
    <p>Gandhi's statement comes amidst the ongoing stand-off between India and China in Ladakh's Galwan Valley. The face-off, which started in May 2020, has seen a violent clash resulting in the death of 20 Indian soldiers and an unknown number of Chinese soldiers.</p>
    <p>Gandhi's stand on the issue is significant, given that he has been highly critical of the Modi government's policies and actions in the past. His statement is likely to add pressure on the government to take a strong stance against China.</p>
    <h2>India-China relationship in numbers</h2>
    <p>The India-China relationship, which is one of the most important strategic and economic relationships in the world, has seen its fair share of ups and downs in recent years. Below are some numbers that illustrate the complex nature of this relationship:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>The total trade volume between India and China stood at $92 billion in 2019.</li>
     <li>China is India's second-largest trading partner, accounting for around 13.7% of India's total trade.</li>
     <li>The two countries have a long-standing border dispute, which has led to several stand-offs and tense situations in the past.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The need for a strong stance</h2>
    <p>Given the current situation in Ladakh and the broader geopolitical landscape, it is imperative that India maintains a strong stance on its territorial integrity and strategic interests. This is not just about protecting India's borders, but also its economic and strategic interests.</p>
    <p>China's Belt and Road Initiative, which seeks to connect China with various countries through a network of infrastructure projects, has raised serious concerns about Beijing's intentions. Critics argue that the BRI is a way for China to expand its influence and control in various regions, including South Asia.</p>
    <p>In this context, it is important that India takes a strong stance and pushes back against China's aggressive tactics. This includes using diplomatic channels, increasing military capabilities and establishing partnerships with other countries to counter Chinese influence.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, Rahul Gandhi's statement on India-China relationship is significant and underlines the need for a strong stance on India's territorial integrity and strategic interests. While the relationship between the two countries is complex and multifaceted, it is important that India asserts itself and refuses to be pushed around by China's aggression.</p>
    <p>The road ahead for India will be challenging, but by staying firm and resolute, India can emerge as a strong and confident player in the region and beyond.</p>
