   <p>When it comes to defense, the stakes are always high. One small glitch could cost a nation millions, if not billions, of dollars. This was exactly what happened when a BrahMos missile went astray, landing in Pakistan's territory, costing India around 24 crores.</p>

   <h2>The Cost of Misfiring a Missile</h2>
   <p>On January 23, 2022, the BrahMos missile, which was being tested, deviated from its path and ended up in Pakistan's Balochistan province. The incident cost India a whopping 24 crores in damages, not to mention the diplomatic fiasco that ensued.</p>
   <h3>Quantifiable Examples</h3>
   <p>The cost of the missile alone was around 30 crores. However, the damage caused by the missile landing in Pakistan's territory was far more significant. Pakistan lodged a strong protest, and India had to issue an apology. This incident affected the bilateral relations between the two countries.</p>
   <p>The cost of the missile misfiring was far more than just monetary. This incident also caused damage to India's image and reputation in the world. It proved that India was not as advanced in defense as it claimed to be, which could have far-reaching consequences, especially in terms of foreign investments.</p>

    <li>Defense is an area where even a small mistake can have far-reaching consequences.</li>
    <li>The cost of a missile misfiring is not just monetary, it can also have a significant impact on a country's image and reputation.</li>
    <li>Proper testing and safety measures must be taken to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future.</li>
   </ol>
   <h3></h3>
   <p>I remember when I was a child, my father, who was in the military, would often talk about the importance of proper safety measures while handling weapons and explosives. He would often share stories of how even a small mistake could cause severe damage and loss of life.</p>
   <p>As an adult, I now understand the gravity of his words. The recent incident with the BrahMos missile only proves how essential proper training and safety measures are when it comes to defense.</p>
