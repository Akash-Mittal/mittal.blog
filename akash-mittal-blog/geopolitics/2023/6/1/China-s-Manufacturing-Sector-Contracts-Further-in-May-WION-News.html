    <p>China's manufacturing sector has been a cause of concern for the world economy for a while now. The sector has been showing signs of a contraction for the past few months, but the slump reached a new low in May, contracting at a pace not seen in over a decade.</p>
    <p>The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the manufacturing sector, which is a widely used measure of the health of the sector, fell to 49.4 in May from 50.1 in April. This is the lowest reading in over 10 years and below the important 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction.</p>
    <p>The cause of this slump is a combination of both domestic and international factors. The ongoing trade war with the United States has had a significant impact on China's exports, which have been one of the key drivers of the country's economic growth in the past few decades. In addition, China's domestic demand has also been slowing down, which has added to the woes of the manufacturing sector.</p>
    <p>One of the biggest problems facing the manufacturing sector is the overcapacity in many industries. The country has built up a huge production capacity in several industries, like steel, cement and glass, which has led to a glut in the market. This, coupled with the lack of demand, has resulted in factories cutting back production and laying off workers.</p>
    <p>This contraction in the manufacturing sector has a ripple effect on the rest of the economy as well. The services sector, which has been one of the bright spots in China's economy, is also starting to show signs of weakness as the lower demand for manufacturing products affects the supply chains of other industries.</p>
    <p>The Chinese government has been taking several measures to boost the economy, such as cutting taxes and increasing spending on infrastructure. However, these measures will take some time to show their effects, and the manufacturing sector is likely to remain weak in the near future.</p>
