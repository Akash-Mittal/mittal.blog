   <p>The scorching heat in Asia has set new records this May, causing widespread discomfort and putting millions of lives at risk. In Delhi, the capital city of India, the temperature soared to 47 degrees Celsius, the highest ever recorded in the month of May. People are forced to stay indoors to avoid the heat, and many are suffering from heat-related illnesses.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile, in Bangladesh, the country is facing a severe heatwave with temperatures hovering around 42 degrees Celsius, causing power cuts and water shortage. The situation is similar in Pakistan, where the temperature has crossed the 50-degree mark in some cities, making it the hottest May in decades.</p>
   <p>The scorching heat is not only causing discomfort, but it's also taking a toll on the environment and the economy. The prolonged dry spell is leading to crop failure and water scarcity, affecting the livelihoods of millions of farmers. The heat is also exacerbating air pollution, creating a hazardous breathing environment for people.</p>
   <p>The situation is alarming, and urgent action is needed to tackle the climate crisis before it's too late.</p>

    <li>In Sri Lanka, the temperature soared to 39.5 degrees Celsius, the highest ever recorded in the country in May.</li>
