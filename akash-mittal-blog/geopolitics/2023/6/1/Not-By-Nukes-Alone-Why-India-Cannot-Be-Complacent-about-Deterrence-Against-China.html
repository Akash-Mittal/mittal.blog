   <p><em>"It was the early hours of a chilly January morning in 2016 when the Indian Navy's nuclear submarine INS Arihant slipped its moorings and disappeared into the Bay of Bengal. Its mission was simple: to complete India's nuclear triad - the ability to fire nuclear missiles from land, air and sea. It was a milestone in India's quest for a credible nuclear deterrent against its arch-rival Pakistan, and more ominously, against China."</em></p>

   <h2>India's Nuclear Arsenal</h2>
   <p>Since conducting its first nuclear test in 1974, India has come a long way in developing a credible nuclear deterrent against its adversaries. Today, India's nuclear arsenal consists of nuclear-capable missiles, bombers and submarines, giving it a triad of nuclear delivery options that can strike targets deep inside enemy territory.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Missiles - India has developed a range of nuclear-capable missiles that can be launched from land, air and sea. The most formidable of these is the Agni-V, an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) with a range of over 5,000 km that can reach the whole of China and most of Europe.</li>
    <li>Bombers - India has a fleet of Sukhoi Su-30MKI fighter jets that can be modified to carry nuclear bombs. These bombers provide India with a tactical nuclear option to respond to any Pakistani aggression on the border.</li>
    <li>Submarines - India currently operates one nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN), INS Arihant, that can carry up to 12 nuclear-tipped missiles. Two more SSBNs are under construction, which will add to India's sea-based nuclear deterrence.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>The China Factor</h2>
   <p>While India's nuclear arsenal is designed primarily to deter Pakistan, it is becoming increasingly clear that China is also a target of Indian nuclear deterrence. The two Asian giants have a long-standing territorial dispute over the Himalayan border, which has led to several military stand-offs in recent years.</p>
   <p>In addition, China's growing military might - especially its naval capabilities and infrastructure projects in India's vicinity - have raised concerns in India about its security. China's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to connect Asia, Europe and Africa through a network of ports, railways and highways, has been viewed with suspicion by India, which sees it as an attempt to encircle and isolate India.</p>
   <p>However, India's nuclear deterrence against China cannot be solely reliant on its nuclear weapons. First, India's nuclear arsenal is still in its infancy compared to China's vast nuclear program, which includes ICBMs, multiple warhead systems, and a sophisticated missile defense system. Second, relying on nuclear weapons alone to deter China could lead to a dangerous and destabilizing nuclear arms race in the region.</p>
   <h2>Other Forms of Deterrence</h2>
   <p>India cannot be complacent about deterrence against China and needs to explore other forms of deterrence as well. Some of these could include:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Economic - India can use its economic leverage to deter China, by limiting Chinese investments in India and diversifying its own trade and investment relationships.</li>
    <li>Military - India can continue to modernize its armed forces and develop smarter military strategies to counter China's military might. This could include developing a strong navy to challenge China's dominance of the Indian Ocean, and investing in space and cyber capabilities to counter China's advancements in these areas.</li>
    <li>Diplomatic - India can use diplomatic channels to assert its interests and gain greater support from its allies, particularly the United States, Japan and Australia.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <div id="conclusion">
    <h2>In summary, India's nuclear deterrence against China cannot be solely reliant on its nuclear weapons program. Other forms of deterrence - economic, military and diplomatic - need to be explored to ensure a stable and peaceful relationship between the two Asian giants.</h2>
