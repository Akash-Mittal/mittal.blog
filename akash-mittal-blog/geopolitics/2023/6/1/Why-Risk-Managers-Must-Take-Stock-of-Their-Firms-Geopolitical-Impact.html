   <h2>The Consequences of Ignoring Geopolitical Risks</h2>
   <p>Jonathan, the CEO of an MNC, was ecstatic. His company, which had operations in multiple countries, was doing well financially. He had just received the news that the company had reported a profit for the last quarter. However, the news was short-lived. A week later, his financial controller informed him that the company's investment in a South American country was under risk due to political unrest caused by the government's policies. Jonathan did not take the geopolitical risks into account when he decided to invest in that country. Now he was facing a loss of millions of dollars, and he had learned a hard lesson that geopolitical risks should not be ignored.</p>
   <p>Jonathan's story is not unique. Many companies have failed to account for geopolitical risks, resulting in financial losses or reputational damage. The rise of populism, trade wars, civil unrest, and terrorism are a few examples of geopolitical risks that can affect a company's bottom line or reputation.</p>
   <h2>The Importance of Identifying Geopolitical Risks</h2>
   <p>Geopolitical risks can cause significant financial losses to businesses. However, they are often overlooked or ignored by decision-makers who are focused on the day-to-day operations of their businesses. By failing to account for geopolitical risks, companies can find themselves facing significant financial losses or reputational damage that can take years to recover from.</p>
   <p>A 2017 survey of 1,000 global executives conducted by McKinsey &amp; Company found that geopolitical risks were among the top three concerns for businesses. Despite this, only 13 percent of the respondents said their companies had a process in place to address geopolitical risks.</p>
   <p>Identifying geopolitical risks begins with analyzing the countries and regions where a company does business. Companies should consider factors such as political stability, corruption, human rights, and economic conditions in those countries. By analyzing these factors, companies can identify potential risks and take steps to mitigate them.</p>
   <h2>The Role of Risk Managers</h2>
   <p>Risk managers play a critical role in identifying and mitigating geopolitical risks. They are responsible for developing strategies that assess and manage a company's risks, including those related to geopolitical threats.</p>
   <p>Risk managers should work closely with decision-makers to ensure that geopolitical risks are taken into account when making investment decisions. They should develop risk management strategies that take into account the potential impact of geopolitical risks on a company's operations. This includes developing contingency plans in case of political or economic instability in a country where a company does business.</p>
   <p>Additionally, risk managers should keep up to date with geopolitical events and trends. This will enable them to identify emerging risks before they become a threat to a company's operations or reputation. By being proactive in identifying and addressing geopolitical risks, risk managers can help businesses avoid financial losses and reputational damage.</p>
