  <h1>The Growing Economic Ties Between Australia, New Zealand, China, and India</h1> <img src="images/Australia-and-New-Zealand-s-Trade-Round-Up.jpeg" alt="+Australia-and-New-Zealand-s-Trade-Round-Up+">
  <p>Trade has always been an integral part of the global economy. But with the increasing interconnectedness of nations, it has become even more important. In this article, we will look at how Australia and New Zealand are strengthening their economic ties with China and India.</p>
  <h2>The Story of Kiwi Fruits</h2>
  <p>One example of a successful partnership between New Zealand and China is in the export of kiwi fruits. New Zealand has been exporting kiwi fruits to China for over a decade. In 2019, New Zealand exported 59 million trays of kiwi fruits to China, worth NZD 1.18 billion. This was up from 19 million trays in 2010.</p>
  <p>The Chinese market is particularly important for New Zealand's kiwi fruit exports, as it is the largest market for kiwi fruits in the world. This success can be attributed to the free trade agreement between New Zealand and China, which was signed in 2008. This agreement has helped to reduce tariffs on New Zealand kiwi fruits, making them more affordable for Chinese consumers.</p>
  <h2>China and India Links</h2>
  <p>In recent years, China's economic ties with India have also been growing. According to the Ministry of Commerce of China, bilateral trade between China and India exceeded USD 100 billion in 2018. This is a significant increase from the USD 73.9 billion in 2017. China is now India's largest trading partner, while India is China's 11th largest trading partner.</p>
  <p>The two countries have been working together to increase bilateral trade even further. In 2019, the two countries held their first high-level mechanism to discuss trade and investment cooperation. They also agreed to set up a new mechanism to discuss trade issues and to establish a high-level economic and trade dialogue. India and China are also exploring the possibility of starting direct flights between their two countries to boost tourism.</p>
  <h2>Australia-India Trade Talks</h2>
  <p>Australia and India have also been working to strengthen their economic ties. In June 2020, the two countries held their first-ever virtual summit, where they discussed ways to increase trade and investment. They also agreed to work together to mitigate the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
  <p>One of the key areas of focus for Australia and India is in the export of agricultural products. India is a major market for Australian pulses, with exports worth AUD 1.4 billion in 2018-19. Australia is also looking to increase its exports of dairy products to India.</p>
  <h2>The Future of Trade</h2>
  <p>As we can see, the economic ties between Australia, New Zealand, China, and India are becoming stronger. This is a positive development, as increased trade can help to boost global economic growth. It is also important for countries to diversify their trading partners, as this can help to reduce their reliance on any one country or region.</p>
  <p>The future of trade is uncertain, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, one thing is clear â€“ the need for international cooperation and trade will continue to be essential in the years to come.</p>
