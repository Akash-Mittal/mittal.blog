  <p>India's virtual participation in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit held last month was an interesting move that conveyed the country's stance on its strained relationships with China and Pakistan.</p>
  <p>Amidst the ongoing border disputes with China and Pakistan's hostile attitude, India chose to join the SCO Summit virtually, which was held in a hybrid format in Tajikistan. India was represented by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar who delivered a speech via video link.</p>
  <p>This year's SCO Summit was crucial as it marked the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the intergovernmental organisation. Leaders of SCO member states, including China, Russia, Pakistan, and Central Asian nations, participated in the summit to discuss regional security, counter-terrorism, and economic cooperation.</p>
  
  <p>The virtual participation by India in the SCO Summit may seem like a symbolic gesture, but it has significant implications. Here are some quantifiable examples:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>India's move to participate virtually in the SCO Summit indicates New Delhi's efforts to maintain a balance between its strategic interests and regional security.</li>
   <li>The virtual summit saved India a significant amount of resources, including time and money.</li>
   <li>India's virtual presence at the SCO Summit helped it maintain a diplomatic relationship with the SCO member nations despite the current tensions with China and Pakistan.</li>
