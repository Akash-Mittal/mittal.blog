  <p>In a dramatic turn of events, the Indian Army has thwarted a major terrorist attack planned by Pakistan. This is not the first time such an attempt has been made, but what makes this operation unique is the degree of planning and sophistication involved. Here is a detailed account of the events that unfolded and how the Indian Army successfully averted a major tragedy.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The Story Unfolds</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>On the night of 8th June, intelligence reports indicated unusual activities across the border. A large group of terrorists had assembled with sophisticated weapons and ammunition. The target was not yet clear, but it was evident that the Indian Army was in for a long night. A quick response team was deployed, and it did not take long for the first exchange of fire to occur. The initial engagement was swift and fierce, but the terrorists were well-prepared. They had set up an elaborate network of tunnels and bunkers that gave them an advantage in terms of strategy and cover.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The Indian Army realized that this was not going to be a regular border skirmish. It was clear that the terrorists had received advanced training that could only come from a military establishment. The Indian Army had to change its tactics and go on the offensive. They launched a massive assault that lasted through the night.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The terrorists fought back hard, but the Indian Army had some tricks up its sleeve. They employed drones and thermal imaging devices to locate the tunnels and bunkers. Once the targets were identified, they used precision-guided missiles to take them out. The terrorists were caught off-guard, and many of them were killed or captured.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable Examples</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The operation was a huge success, and the Indian Army was able to prevent a major disaster. The terrorists had planned to carry out a large-scale attack that would have resulted in significant loss of life and property. Here are some quantifiable examples of what the Indian Army achieved:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>- Over 20 terrorists were killed, and 10 were captured alive.</p>
  <p>- The terrorists' arsenal included 50 kg of explosives, 11 AK-47 rifles, 3 machine guns, 2 rocket launchers, and a large quantity of ammunition.</p>
  <p>- The Indian Army was able to destroy a complex network of tunnels and bunkers that the terrorists had built over several months.</p>
