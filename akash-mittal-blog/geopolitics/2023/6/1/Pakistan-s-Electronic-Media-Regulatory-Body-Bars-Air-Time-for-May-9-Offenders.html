  <p></p>
  <p>It was a typical day in Pakistan's northern region. The sun was shining bright, and the birds were chirping merrily in the trees. Little did the residents of this region know that a fateful day was about to unfold. As the day progressed, news started to filter in that there had been an attack on a school. It was a horrifying incident and one that would be etched in the nation's memory for years to come. On May 9, 2019, a terrorist attack took place at an elite school in Pakistan, resulting in the deaths of over a dozen people, including children.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The attack was a stark reminder of the fragility of life and the ever-present threat of terrorism. As the nation mourned, the government vowed to take serious action to prevent such incidents from happening again. One of the significant steps taken in this regard was by the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA).</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>PEMRA, Pakistan's primary regulatory body for electronic media, issued a public notice on May 13, 2019, stating that no television channel or radio station would be allowed to broadcast or re-broadcast any content related to the May 9 attack. The notice also prohibited any coverage of banned organizations or individuals promoting their agenda.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>PEMRA's decision came as a shock to many media outlets, but it was an essential measure to control and prevent the dissemination of inflammatory material. Broadcasting such content could have incited violence. However, the ban did not go down well with some media outlets, primarily those affiliated with the opposition party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The PTI, led by Imran Khan, was vehemently opposed to the decision. The party believed that the ban was a violation of press freedoms and a curb on the right to information. However, despite their opposition, PEMRA's ban remained in place.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The decision was a bold move and one that had a significant impact on the media industry. Still, it was a necessary measure to prevent any further incidents of violence and promote a safe and peaceful environment in the country.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable Examples</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The ban on May 9 offenders was not a new concept. PEMRA had imposed similar bans in the past. In 2014, the regulatory body had banned a TV channel for airing provocative content, which could have incited sectarian violence. Similarly, in 2016, PEMRA banned TV channels from airing news items promoting sectarianism and intolerance.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>While the move to ban such content was controversial, it had a significant impact on reducing violence in the country. According to a report by the Pakistan Institute of Peace Studies (PIPS), there was an overall reduction in activities by banned sectarian organizations in 2016. The report also noted that incidents of sectarian violence decreased by 45% in 2016 compared to the previous year. These statistics clearly indicate the positive impact of PEMRA's ban on reducing violence and promoting a safe environment.</p>

  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion in 3 points</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. PEMRA's ban on broadcasting content related to the May 9 attack was a crucial step in promoting a safe and peaceful environment in the country.</p>
  <p>2. The ban was essential to prevent the dissemination of inflammatory material that could have incited violence.</p>
  <p>3. PEMRA's past bans have had a positive impact in reducing violence and promoting tolerance in the country.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p>As a Pakistani citizen, I have personally witnessed the impact of violence on daily life. It is not just the loss of life that is devastating but the fear that it instils in people. The measures taken by PEMRA are essential to reduce violence and promote a safe environment. While it may seem like a limitation of freedom of speech, it is a necessary measure to prevent further incidents of violence.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Practical Tips</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. As media consumers, we need to be mindful of the content we watch. It is our responsibility to ensure that we do not encourage or promote violence through the material we consume.</p>
  <p>2. News outlets need to be cautious about the content that they broadcast. They should refrain from sensationalizing news stories that could incite violence.</p>
  <p>3. The government needs to continue its efforts to promote tolerance and a safe environment. PEMRA's actions are a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done to address the root causes of violence in the country.</p>
