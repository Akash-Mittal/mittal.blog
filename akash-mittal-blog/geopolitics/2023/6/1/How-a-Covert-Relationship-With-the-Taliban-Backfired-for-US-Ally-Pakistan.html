    <p>It was a sunny day when Mohammad, a small businessman in Peshawar, Pakistan, got a phone call from his boss. He was instructed to shut down his small electronics store on the crowded market street and evacuate the area immediately. Confused, he asked for the reason, but his boss didn't give any explanation and hung up the phone. Later that day, Mohammad learned that a suicide bomber had detonated an explosive device just a few blocks away, killing and injuring dozens of people.</p>
    <p>Such incidents were unfortunately common in Pakistan during the late 2000s and early 2010s, when the country was grappling with a wave of terrorism that claimed thousands of lives and cost billions of dollars in losses. At the time, the Taliban - a radical Islamic group that ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 - had regrouped in the tribal areas along Pakistan's border, using the ungoverned territory as a launchpad for attacks on both Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as planning international terrorist plots.</p>
    <p>While Pakistan officially opposed the Taliban, its intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), secretly maintained a relationship with the group, hoping to exert influence in Afghanistan and protect its own interests. However, this strategy backfired in many ways and turned into a liability for Pakistan's economy and international relations.</p>

    <h2>The cost of terrorism</h2>
    <p>Pakistan's relationship with the Taliban resulted in a vicious cycle of violence that took a heavy toll on its citizens, businesses, and government. According to estimates by the Global Terrorism Database, Pakistan experienced more than 41,000 terrorist attacks between 2001 and 2018, resulting in over 74,000 deaths and 123,000 injuries. The attacks targeted a wide range of targets, from military and police installations to religious sites, marketplaces, schools, hospitals, and public transport.</p>
    <p>The attacks had a significant impact on Pakistan's economy, as they scared away foreign investors, disrupted trade, and caused widespread damage to infrastructure and property. The Pakistan Institute of Development Economics estimated in 2017 that the cumulative economic cost of terrorism from 2000 to 2017 was about $126 billion, or around 6% of the country's GDP. The report also noted that the terrorist violence had reduced the lifespan of an average Pakistani citizen by about five years.</p>

    <h2>The repercussions on international relations</h2>
    <p>Pakistan's covert ties with the Taliban also strained its relations with other countries, especially the United States, which was leading a coalition of forces in Afghanistan to fight the Taliban and other militant groups. The U.S. government repeatedly accused Pakistan of providing safe havens and other support to the Taliban, and threatened to cut off aid and launch military strikes on Pakistani soil. The tensions between the two countries worsened after the U.S. raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011, which embarrassed and angered the Pakistani government and military.</p>
    <p>The deteriorating relations with the U.S. and other Western countries also hurt Pakistan's international standing and credibility. Many Western governments and media outlets portrayed Pakistan as an unreliable partner in the fight against terrorism and a source of instability in the region. As a result, Pakistan found it harder to get foreign aid, attract foreign tourists and investors, and participate in multilateral diplomacy.</p>

    <h2>The need for a new approach</h2>
    <p>After years of denying or downplaying its links with the Taliban, the Pakistani government has started to acknowledge the need for a new approach. In recent years, it has launched military operations against Taliban strongholds in the tribal areas and implemented a National Action Plan that includes measures to counter terrorism financing, extremism, and hate speech.</p>
    <p>Pakistan also seeks to normalize its relations with Afghanistan and the U.S., with which it signed a peace deal in February 2020. The deal aims to end the Afghan war and bring the Taliban into a power-sharing agreement with the Afghan government. Many analysts see this as an opportunity for Pakistan to play a more constructive role in resolving the Afghan conflict and improving its ties with the U.S. and other Western countries.</p>
    <p>However, the challenges facing Pakistan are still daunting. The country still faces threats from other militant groups, such as the Islamic State and domestic sectarian organizations. Its democratic institutions and human rights record are also under scrutiny, with accusations of censorship, corruption, and draconian laws. To overcome these challenges and regain its economic and political stability, Pakistan needs to continue its fight against terrorism and extremism, while also promoting social and economic development and democratic reforms.</p>
