    <p>It was supposed to be a covert relationship that would help the US ally Pakistan gain the upper hand in the war against terrorism. Pakistan had long been suffering from the spillover effects of the terrorist activities in its neighbourhood and had sought US and global support in its fight against terrorism. However, Pakistan's decision to play a double game ended up being a nightmare, ultimately resulting in the rise of the very extremist groups it had sought to silence.</p>

    <p>One of the main examples of Pakistan's covert support for the Taliban was through its intelligence agency, the ISI, which provided training, intelligence, and even funds to the extremist group. The ISI was using the Taliban as a proxy in its regional power struggle with India, which was supporting the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan.</p>
    <p>This covert relationship resulted in years of violence and bloodshed in Afghanistan, and the rise of extremist groups that went on to threaten Pakistan's own security. The US, which had been a key ally of Pakistan, ultimately had to step in and take action against Bin Laden and other terrorists hiding in Pakistan, leading to a strain in the relationship between the two countries.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, Pakistan's support for the Taliban was directly responsible for the rise of the Pakistani Taliban, a faction that goes against the Pakistani state and government, and has carried out numerous deadly attacks, including the infamous attack on a school in Peshawar in 2014, which killed more than 140 people, most of them children.</p>

    <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
    <p>One of the most striking examples of how Pakistan's support for the Taliban backfired is the case of Malala Yousafzai, the young activist who defied the Taliban's ban on education for girls and was shot in the head. The Taliban's violent actions against Malala sparked a global outcry and forced Pakistan to confront its own role in supporting extremist groups.</p>
    <p>Another example is the case of refugees fleeing violence and instability in Afghanistan. Pakistan, which shares a long border with Afghanistan, has been a major destination for refugees, but its own support for extremist groups has contributed to the insecurity and violence that drives people to flee the region.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, the case of Pakistan's covert relationship with the Taliban is a cautionary tale of how playing a double game with extremist groups can have disastrous consequences. It is a lesson that other countries can learn from as they seek to confront the threat of terrorism and extremism in their regions.</p>
