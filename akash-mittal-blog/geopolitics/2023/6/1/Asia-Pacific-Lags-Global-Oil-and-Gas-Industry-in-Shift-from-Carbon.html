  <h1>Asia Pacific Lags Global Oil and Gas Industry in Shift from Carbon</h1> <img src="images/Asia-Pacific-Lags-Global-Oil-and-Gas-Industry-in-Shift-from-Carbon.jpeg" alt="+Asia-Pacific-Lags-Global-Oil-and-Gas-Industry-in-Shift-from-Carbon+">
  <p>Once upon a time, an oil and gas company in the Asia Pacific region saw a shift in the global market. As they looked around, they realized that many of their competitors were beginning to transition towards renewable and sustainable energy sources. However, this company remained stagnant and continued to rely on fossil fuels as their primary source of energy.</p>
  <p>This story is not unique. Many companies in the Asia Pacific region are falling behind in the global race to reduce carbon emissions and shift towards sustainable energy sources. This lag is concerning as the region is home to some of the largest energy consumers in the world. Furthermore, the shift to sustain energy sources is not only essential to reduce carbon emissions but also crucial for business success.</p>
  <h2> Asia Pacific Lagging</h2>
  <p>According to a report by the International Energy Agency, the Asia Pacific region accounts for more than half of global energy consumption, with China and India alone accounting for almost 40 percent. Despite this, the region has been slow to transition towards sustainable energy sources. As per the 2020 Global Energy Review by the IEA:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Renewables represented just 7.7 percent of Asia Pacific's energy mix in 2019, compared to the global average of 11.8 percent.</li>
   <li>In India, the share of coal in the power sector continued to decline in 2019, but it still accounted for almost three-quarters of total electricity generation.</li>
   <li>In Southeast Asia, coal accounted for 32 percent of primary energy supply in 2019, with the region's carbon emissions expected to increase by 60 percent by 2040.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>The Importance of Sustainability for Business Success</h2>
  <p>While the shift to sustainable energy sources is crucial for reducing carbon emissions and protecting the environment, it is also vital for business success. Companies that fail to adapt to new environmental regulations and market trends risk losing market share and access to capital. Furthermore, companies that invest in sustainable energy sources are often able to save costs in the long run through energy efficiency and reduced waste.</p>
  <p>For example, in 2015, the Indian multinational conglomerate, Tata Group, pledged to derive 41 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2025. The company has since invested heavily in renewable energy projects, such as wind and solar power, and has reduced its carbon footprint significantly. Furthermore, the company has been able to save costs through energy efficiency, resulting in improved profitability.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion: Three Points to Consider</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, the Asia Pacific region must prioritize the shift towards sustainable energy sources to reduce carbon emissions, protect the environment, and ensure business success. Here are three points to consider:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Embrace Renewable Energy Sources: The region must invest heavily in renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind energy, to reduce carbon emissions and ensure sustainability.</li>
   <li>Adapt to New Regulations and Market Trends: Companies must adapt to new environmental regulations and market trends and invest in sustainable energy sources to remain competitive in the long run.</li>
   <li>Collaborate: Collaboration among governments, private sector companies, and civil society is essential to enable the shift towards sustainable energy sources.</li>
  </ol>
