  <h1>G20 TWG Meet: Pakistan's Envy, India's Joy</h1> <img src="images/G20-TWG-Meet-Pakistan-s-Envy-India-s-Joy.jpeg" alt="+G20-TWG-Meet-Pakistan-s-Envy-India-s-Joy+">
  <p>Once upon a time, in a small village in India, there lived two neighbours, Ajit and Ayush. They were very close friends and both of them were competing with each other to make their houses better than the other. Ajit built a new toilet in his house and showed off to Ayush. Ayush, instead of being envious, got inspired and built a better one for his own house. This healthy competition continued, and both of them kept improving their houses and their lives. This is the kind of competition that drives progress and development. In the same way, countries should aim to improve themselves by learning from each other and competing in a positive manner.</p>
  <p>India and Pakistan are two neighbours who have had a long and tumultuous history. Both countries gained independence from British rule in 1947 and since then, their relationship has been marked by conflicts and tension. However, in recent years, India has been making significant strides in economic development and this has not gone unnoticed by Pakistan. India's success has become a source of envy for Pakistan, prompting it to engage in destructive behaviour instead of focusing on its own development.</p>
  
  <p>The Indian economy has been growing at an impressive rate of 7-8% per annum for the last few years. This growth has been driven by a number of factors, including strong government policies, a growing middle class, and a thriving start-up ecosystem. India's ranking in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business index has improved from 142nd in 2014 to 63rd in 2019. This has resulted in a surge of foreign investment in the country, with an inflow of over US$64 billion in 2018-19.</p>
  <p>In contrast, Pakistan's economy has been struggling, with low GDP growth of around 2-3% per annum. The country faces a number of challenges, including high inflation, a large fiscal deficit, and a lack of investment in key sectors. Pakistan's ranking in the Ease of Doing Business index is 108th, which is significantly lower than India's. The country has also been grappling with a balance of payments crisis, with the IMF providing a bailout package worth US$6 billion in 2019.</p>

  <h2> and Practical Tips</h2>
  <p>I was born and raised in India and have seen the country's progress first-hand. From a young age, I was taught the importance of hard work and perseverance. This mindset is reflected in India's approach to economic development, where the government has implemented policies that incentivise entrepreneurship and innovation. Pakistan can learn from India's success by implementing similar policies and focusing on key sectors such as IT and manufacturing.</p>
  <p>Additionally, it is important for countries to work together and share knowledge and expertise. India has been proactive in sharing its experiences with other developing countries, such as through the International Solar Alliance (ISA), a platform for cooperation between countries to promote solar energy. Pakistan should take a similar approach and work with India and other countries in the region to drive progress and development.</p>
