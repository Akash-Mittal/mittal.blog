   <p>Imagine you're driving your car on a crowded highway, and suddenly your car alerts you to a potential collision ahead, prompting you to immediately take preventative action. Or perhaps you're a doctor diagnosing a patient, and a machine learning algorithm helps you to accurately identify the disease and prescribe the best treatment. These scenarios are no longer the predictions of a sci-fi novel - they're the reality of a world where artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming every aspect of our lives.</p>

  <h2>The AI Supercycle is Here</h2>

   <p>One of the biggest industries to be impacted by AI is healthcare. AI-enabled medical devices are projected to save $150 billion annually for the healthcare industry by 2026, while also improving patient outcomes. Another industry that's seeing major AI adoption is finance, with AI-powered fraud detection systems projected to save banks $40 billion annually by 2023.</p>
