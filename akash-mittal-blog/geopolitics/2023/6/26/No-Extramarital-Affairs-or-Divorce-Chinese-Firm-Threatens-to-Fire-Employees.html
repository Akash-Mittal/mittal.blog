   <p>What do you do in your personal life is your own business? Not if you work for a Chinese company! A firm in China has issued a new rule threatening to fire employees if they have extramarital affairs or file for a divorce. The company stated that these actions would "cause harm to the company's reputation" and "affect the work environment."</p>
   <h2>Examples of Strict Workplace Policies Around the Globe</h2>
   <p>It's not just this Chinese company that has strict workplace policies. Here are some other examples:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>In Japan, it is common for companies to have a ban on visible tattoos. Employees are often required to cover up tattoos with clothing or makeup.</li>
    <li>In the United States, many companies have a zero-tolerance policy for drug and alcohol use. Employees are often subject to random drug tests.</li>
    <li>In Dubai, it is illegal for unmarried couples to live together. This law extends to the workplace, and companies can require proof of marriage before providing housing to employees.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Case Studies of Employers' Interference in Employees' Personal Lives</h2>
   <h3>Case Study 1: US Company Fires Employee for Legal Marijuana Use</h3>
   <p>In 2018, a US company fired an employee who had a legal prescription for medical marijuana. The company argued that the marijuana use violated its drug-free workplace policy. The employee sued the company for discrimination, but the case was dismissed by the courts.</p>
   <h3>Case Study 2: Chinese Company Requires Employees to Seek Spouse Approval</h3>
   <p>In 2017, a Chinese company required employees to seek approval from their spouse before pursuing a promotion. The company stated that the policy was aimed at promoting "family harmony."</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>While employers are within their rights to set workplace policies, it is important to consider the impact these policies may have on employees' personal lives. Additionally, companies should ensure that their policies are not discriminatory and do not violate employees' rights. In summary, workplace policies should:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Be reasonable and fair to all employees</li>
    <li>Not discriminate against any employee based on personal characteristics</li>
    <li>Not interfere unnecessarily with employees' personal lives</li>
   </ol>
