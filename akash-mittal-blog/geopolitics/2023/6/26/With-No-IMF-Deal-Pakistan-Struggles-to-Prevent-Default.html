    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>In August 2018, Pakistan reached an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a $6 billion bailout loan to help stabilize the economy. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent economic downturn, Pakistan failed to meet the IMF's conditions for the loan. As a result, Pakistan is now struggling to prevent default.</p>
    <p>Without this financial support, Pakistan is facing a severe financial crisis with looming debt payments, a plunging currency, and high inflation rates. The country's economy is in a perilous state, and the situation is exacerbating poverty and unemployment rates, leading to social unrest and political instability.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>The impact of Pakistan's financial crisis is not just limited to the economy but is also affecting its people.</p>
    <ul>
     <li><strong>Inflation:</strong> With the fall of the Pakistani rupee, the cost of imports has increased, and this is leading to a rise in inflation rates in the country. Basic necessities like food, petrol, and electricity are becoming unaffordable for many people. As a result, Pakistanis are finding it difficult to make ends meet.</li>
     <li><strong>Jobs:</strong> Due to the economic downturn, many businesses are shutting down, leading to a significant loss of jobs. With unemployment rates soaring, people are finding it difficult to sustain their livelihoods.</li>
     <li><strong>Education:</strong> As a result of the financial crisis, many schools and universities are facing financial difficulties, leading to a deteriorating quality of education in the country.</li>
    </ul>
