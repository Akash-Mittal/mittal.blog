  <h1>The Terror of Religious Extremism: Killing of Sikh Man in Pakistan by ISIS</h1></br> <img src="images/The-Terror-of-Religious-Extremism-Killing-of-Sikh-Man-in-Pakistan-by-ISIS.jpeg" alt="+The-Terror-of-Religious-Extremism-Killing-of-Sikh-Man-in-Pakistan-by-ISIS+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.voanews.com/a/islamic-state-group-claims-killing-sikh-man-in-pakistan-s-northwest/7152428.html" target="_blank" href="https://www.voanews.com/a/islamic-state-group-claims-killing-sikh-man-in-pakistan-s-northwest/7152428.html" rel="noopener">https://www.voanews.com/a/islamic-state-group-claims-killing-sikh-man-in-pakistan-s-northwest/7152428.html</a></span></h5>
  <p>It was a regular day for Jagjit Singh and his family in Pakistan's northwest region. Jagjit was a respected and successful businessman and a practicing Sikh. He was looking forward to attending his niece's wedding that day. The family was getting ready when suddenly a group of masked men entered their home. Jagjit was dragged out of his house and was never seen again.</p>
  <p>Soon after, the ISIS claimed responsibility for the brutal murder of Jagjit Singh. This incident highlighted the increasing religious extremism in the country and the growing threat it poses to minorities like Sikhs.</p>
  <h2>The Rise of Extremism in Pakistan</h2>
  <p>Pakistan has a history of religious extremism dating back to the 1970s when the country saw a surge in the growth of Islamist parties and movements. Their success was due to the policies of the military dictator General Zia-ul-Haq, who introduced strict Islamic laws and encouraged the growth of Islamist militias.</p>
  <p>The situation worsened in the 1980s when Pakistan supported the Afghan Mujahideen during their war against the Soviet Union. This led to the growth of various Islamist militant groups in Pakistan, which were funded and supported by foreign countries. These groups later turned against the Pakistani state, and the country saw a wave of terrorist attacks and sectarian violence in the 2000s.</p>
  <h2>The Plight of the Minority Communities in Pakistan</h2>
  <p>The religious extremism in Pakistan is not limited to a certain sect or religion. Minority communities like Christians, Hindus, and Sikhs are often targeted and discriminated against. Many have been forced to flee the country or live in constant fear.</p>
  <p>An example of this is the Christian community in Lahore, who have been facing increasing violence and discrimination. In 2015, two suicide bombers targeted two churches in Lahore, killing 17 people and injuring dozens. In 2019, a blasphemy case against a Christian man, Asia Bibi, garnered international attention as violent protests erupted across the country. The case highlighted the misuse of blasphemy laws against religious minorities in Pakistan.</p>
  <h2>The Plight of the Sikhs in Pakistan</h2>
  <p>The Sikh community in Pakistan has also been facing discrimination and violence for decades. The community was once thriving in the country with many temples and gurdwaras, but now it is gradually diminishing.</p>
  <p>In 2018, a Sikh girl, Jagjit Kaur, was kidnapped and forcibly converted to Islam in Nankana Sahib, which is considered the holiest site for Sikhs in Pakistan. The incident sparked outrage among the Sikh community worldwide.</p>
  <p>The killing of Jagjit Singh in 2020 was another blow to the Sikh community in Pakistan. The ISIS claimed responsibility for the murder, stating that it was a message to the Indian government for their treatment of Muslims in Kashmir.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The rise of religious extremism in Pakistan has had a devastating effect on minority communities. The government must take urgent steps to protect them from violence and discrimination.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The government needs to take strict action against groups promoting religious extremism and terrorism.</li>
   <li>The country's judiciary and police must work towards ensuring justice for all individuals irrespective of their religion.</li>
   <li>The government must promote interfaith harmony and tolerance to counter the extremist ideology.</li>
