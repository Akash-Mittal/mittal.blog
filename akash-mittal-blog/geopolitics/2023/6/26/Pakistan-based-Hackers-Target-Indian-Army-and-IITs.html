    <p>According to recent reports, Pakistan-based hackers have been targeting Indian Army and IITs, using various techniques to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. One particular technique that has been used by these hackers is the use of chat apps.</p>
    <p>Several Indian Army officers and IIT faculty members had reported receiving messages from unknown numbers on WhatsApp, inviting them to click on a link. Unsuspecting users who had clicked the link were directed to a fake login page, where they were asked to enter their credentials. Once the hackers obtained these credentials, they could easily access the victim's email and other sensitive data.</p>
    <p>Another technique used by these hackers is the use of dangerous file names. In some cases, the hackers would send a file with an innocent-sounding name, such as "my_resume.docx" or "family_photos.zip", which, when opened, would execute a malware or Trojan to infect the system.</p>
    <p>These attacks have not only targeted individuals but also entire organizations. In one case, a Pakistani hacker group had launched a cyber attack on the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 2018. The hackers had targeted the email accounts of ISRO employees and tried to obtain sensitive information related to the country's space program.</p>
    <p>Such cyber attacks not only pose a threat to national security but also to business continuity and individual privacy.</p>
    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <h3>Indian Army</h3>
    <p>In early 2021, several Indian Army officers had reported receiving messages on WhatsApp from unknown numbers, inviting them to click on a link. The link directed them to a fake login page, which looked like the official login page of the Indian Army website. The fake login page was created by Pakistani hackers to steal sensitive information such as email IDs and passwords from the Indian Army personnel.</p>
    <p>The Indian Army issued a warning to all its personnel to be cautious while using social media and chat apps and to refrain from clicking on suspicious links or downloading suspicious attachments.</p>
    <h3>Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)</h3>
    <p>In 2020, IIT Kanpur had reported a cyber attack on its email system. The hackers had gained unauthorized access to the IIT email system and had sent phishing emails to various IIT faculty members. The emails were designed to look like official emails from IIT authorities and had asked the recipients to click on a link. The link, when clicked, directed them to a fake login page, which was used by the hackers to steal sensitive information.</p>
    <p>The IIT Kanpur authorities promptly informed the affected faculty members about the cyber attack and advised them to immediately change their passwords.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
