    <h2>The Unbearable Heat</h2>
    <p>It was a typical summer day in New Delhi, India. The sun was shining brightly, and the temperature was soaring. Suresh, a construction worker, had been working for hours in the scorching heat. He felt lightheaded and dizzy and collapsed on the ground. His colleagues rushed him to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with heat exhaustion. Suresh was lucky to survive, but not everyone does. The ongoing heatwave in India and other parts of Asia is pushing humans to the limits of their survivability.</p>

    <h2>The Impact of Heatwaves</h2>
    <p>Heatwaves are not just uncomfortable; they can be life-threatening. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), extreme heat can cause heat exhaustion, heatstroke, and dehydration, which can lead to organ failure and even death. In addition, extreme heat can worsen existing health conditions, such as heart and respiratory diseases. Children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing health conditions are particularly vulnerable to the effects of heatwaves.</p>
    <p>Heatwaves also have economic consequences. The agriculture and livestock sectors are affected, as crops and animals are unable to tolerate extreme temperatures. Workers in outdoor jobs, such as construction, suffer from reduced productivity and increased absenteeism due to heat-related illnesses.</p>

   <section id="casestudies">
    <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
    <p>India is currently experiencing one of its worst heatwaves on record, with temperatures exceeding 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country. The heatwave has already claimed hundreds of lives, with many more suffering from heat-related illnesses. The city of Chennai has been hit particularly hard, with hospitals overwhelmed by patients suffering from dehydration and heatstroke.</p>
    <p>Other parts of Asia are also experiencing the heatwave. In Pakistan, temperatures reached 51 degrees Celsius (123.8 degrees Fahrenheit) in the city of Nawabshah. In Japan, more than 20,000 people have been hospitalized due to the heatwave, with dozens of deaths reported. In Iran, dozens of cities have experienced temperatures exceeding 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>

    <h2>Surviving the Heatwave</h2>
    <p>The ongoing heatwave in Asia is a stark reminder of the impact of climate change on human health and livelihoods. Governments and individuals alike need to take action to mitigate the effects of heatwaves and adapt to a changing climate. Here are three key takeaways:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Stay hydrated and avoid prolonged exposure to the sun during heatwaves.</li>
     <li>Invest in measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change.</li>
     <li>Adapt to the changing climate by implementing policies to protect vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, children, and outdoor workers.</li>
    </ol>
