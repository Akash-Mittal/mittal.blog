  <p>China has been making huge strides towards the electrification of its vehicle fleet, accounting for more than half of global electric vehicle sales today. Recently, Italy has also joined the bandwagon to push for electric cars, but its efforts are being clouded by concerns over China's involvement.</p>
  <h2>The Story</h2>
  <p>China's presence in Italy's electric car market has come to the fore with Matteo Salvini, Italy's far-right leader, warning against the 'China-gate' affair. According to him, China is looking to extend its influence in Italy by investing in the country's electric car market.</p>
  <p>Salvini, also the leader of the anti-immigrant League party, has been critical of the Chinese government in the past. Now, he is voicing his concern over the Chinese-backed acquisition of one of Italy's biggest battery manufacturers, Nidec ASI.</p>
  <p>The deal has raised eyebrows because Nidec ASI makes power conversion systems for electric vehicles and renewable energy. Given China's dominance in the production of EV batteries, critics fear that this move could offer China an edge in Europe's EV market.</p>
  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p>The issue is not limited to just one deal. China's presence in Europe's electric car industry is already well-established, with companies like BYD, CATL, and Tianjin Lishen investing heavily in battery production for electric cars in Europe.</p>
  <p>Italian carmaker, Fiat Chrysler, is also looking to tap into China's EV battery market. The company has announced a joint venture with China's GAC Group to develop electric cars and vehicles fitted with autonomous driving features.</p>
  <p>In Germany, BMW has also entered into a partnership with Chinese company, Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), to supply batteries for its future electric vehicles. The deal is worth around €4 billion ($4.5 billion) and is set to strengthen BMW's position in the EV market.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>One of the biggest concerns is that China's presence in Europe's electric car market could lead to a monopoly on the production of EV batteries. As the demand for EVs continues to grow, it is vital that Europe retains control over the key technologies that power them.</p>
  <p>For example, in 2010, China accounted for just 0.02% of global lithium-ion battery manufacturing. By 2018, the figure had risen to over 70%. This has led to concerns that Europe could become dependent on China for the supply of EV batteries unless it invests heavily in domestic production.</p>
  <p>Another concern is the transfer of key technologies from Europe to China. European companies are partnering with Chinese firms to gain access to China's huge market potential, but in doing so, they risk undermining their own competitiveness.</p>
  <p>For example, BMW's partnership with CATL involves the transfer of battery technology to China. This could potentially undermine Europe's position in the EV market, as China could undercut European firms by producing cheaper EVs using European-developed technology.</p>
