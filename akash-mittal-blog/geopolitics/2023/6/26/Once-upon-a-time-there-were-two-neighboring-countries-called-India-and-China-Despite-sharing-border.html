  <p>Mir, also known as Masood Azhar, is the founder and leader of Jaish-e-Mohammed, a terrorist organization based in Pakistan. The group has been responsible for several attacks in India, including the 2019 Pulwama attack in which 40 Indian soldiers lost their lives. In the aftermath of the attack, India proposed to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to designate Mir as a 'global terrorist.' However, China vetoed the move, citing 'technical reasons.'</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This incident is not an exception but a part of a larger pattern of China's reluctance to cooperate with India on matters of global security. China has also been blocking India's entry into the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) and obstructing India's efforts to bring Masood Azhar to justice. The reason behind China's behavior is rooted in its strategic interests in the region.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>China sees Pakistan as a valuable ally in its ambition to expand its influence in South Asia and counter India's growing hegemony in the region. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a flagship project of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), runs through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), a disputed territory claimed by both India and Pakistan. China's support to Pakistan's position on the issue undermines India's efforts to claim the region. China also views India's growing ties with the United States and Japan as a threat to its regional dominance.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This petty geopolitics has severe implications for global security. Terrorist groups like Jaish-e-Mohammed thrive on the support of state actors, and China's reluctance to act against them enables them to operate with impunity. It also undermines the credibility of the UNSC, which is entrusted with maintaining international peace and security. The UNSC's inability to designate a terrorist like Masood Azhar as a 'global terrorist' despite overwhelming evidence and support from the international community raises questions about its effectiveness.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The international community needs to recognize the severity of this issue and take steps to address it. The following case studies highlight the impact of China's behavior on India's efforts to counter terrorism and its regional ambitions.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case Study 1: India's efforts to bring Masood Azhar to justice</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The Indian government has been trying to bring Masood Azhar to justice for several years. It has provided substantial evidence of his involvement in terrorist activities, but China has been blocking India's efforts at every step. In 2016, China vetoed India's proposal to designate Masood Azhar as a 'global terrorist' at the UNSC. India tried again in 2019 after the Pulwama attack, but China blocked it again. This obstruction enables Masood Azhar and his group to carry out attacks on Indian soil without fear of repercussions. It also undermines India's efforts to counter terrorism and promotes a sense of impunity among terrorist groups.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case Study 2: India's bid for NSG membership</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>India has been trying to become a member of the NSG, a group of countries that regulates the global trade of nuclear materials and technology, for several years. India has a strong nuclear program and a good track record of nuclear safety and security. Its inclusion in the NSG would enhance global security. India's application has received overwhelming support from the international community, except for China, which has been blocking India's bid. China's reason for blocking India's entry is based on the fact that India is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). However, China's own record of proliferation and its support to Pakistan's nuclear program raise questions about the validity of its argument.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The China-India rivalry has taken a dangerous turn, with China's reluctance to cooperate with India on matters of global security. This reluctance is rooted in China's strategic interests in the region, which is preventing it from recognizing the severity of the problem. The international community needs to take steps to address this issue and ensure that terrorist groups do not operate with impunity. The UNSC needs to be reformed to make it more effective in maintaining international peace and security.</p>
  <p></p>
