    <p>When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Apple CEO Tim Cook in May 2016, he made a pitch for the technology giant to start manufacturing in India. Fast forward to 2021, and Apple not only manufactures iPhones in India, but also exports them to European markets. This development is an example of how the world's largest democracy is becoming an increasingly attractive destination for foreign companies looking to pivot their operations to Asia.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>Tesla also recently announced plans to enter India, setting up a subsidiary in the country to launch sales of its electric cars by 2021. The move comes as part of Tesla's larger strategy to expand into emerging markets. India, with its growing middle class and government push toward electrification, presents a huge growth opportunity for Tesla.</p>
    <p>Other big U.S. companies like Walmart, Amazon, and Microsoft have also made significant investments in India in recent years, capitalizing on the country's potential to become one of the world's largest consumer markets.</p>

    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <h3>Apple</h3>
    <p>India has become an increasingly important market for Apple, with the country's smartphone sales projected to surpass the U.S. by 2021. In 2017, Apple began manufacturing iPhones in India, partnering with Taiwanese company Wistron to produce the iPhone SE model at a plant in Bengaluru. The move allowed Apple to avoid high import tariffs and make its products more affordable in India, where the majority of consumers buy lower-priced smartphones. In 2020, Apple expanded manufacturing to include the iPhone 11 model and also started exporting iPhones made in India to European markets.</p>
    <h3>Tesla</h3>
    <p>Tesla's entry into India has been a long time coming, with the company first registering an office in Bengaluru in 2016. However, the luxury electric car maker has faced challenges in navigating India's bureaucratic infrastructure, as well as a lack of charging infrastructure and government incentives for electric vehicles. Despite these hurdles, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly expressed his interest in bringing Tesla to India, citing the country's vast potential for solar energy and his personal connections to the country. With India's push toward electrification and a growing demand for luxury vehicles, Tesla's entry into the market is expected to be a game-changer.</p>
