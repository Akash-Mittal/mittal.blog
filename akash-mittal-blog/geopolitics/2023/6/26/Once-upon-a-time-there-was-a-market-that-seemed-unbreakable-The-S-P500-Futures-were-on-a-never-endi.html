  <p></p>
  <p>As the world was battling the pandemic, the global economy was taking a hit. The S&amp;P500 Futures was no exception and took a massive fall in March 2020, with the market hitting its lowest level since December 2018. Mass sell-offs led to a drop of more than 5% in just one day, and investors were left wondering what had gone wrong.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Despite the cautious optimism surrounding China and Russia's economies, the S&amp;P500 Futures seemed to be licking its wounds, unable to bounce back. Yields dribbled, and the market was struggling to regain its footing. Let's delve deeper into what's happening in the market and why it's causing such chaos.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Examples of the Situation:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One of the possible reasons for the turbulence in the market is the pandemic. The coronavirus has caused chaos worldwide, and the U.S. has been no exception. The country has been in lockdown for a while, and this has resulted in stocks taking a massive hit. The irony is that the markets are mostly disconnected from the broader economy. As of August 2021, the S&amp;P500 futures have hit new all-time highs even with national lockdowns still ongoing.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The second reason for the market's turbulence could be the U.S. election. The U.S. election was one of the most polarizing in history, and it had a significant effect on the markets. Investors were uncertain about whether the incumbent president would return or if the government would see significant changes. This uncertainty led to a lot of volatility in the market, and the yields suffered greatly.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case Studies:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The market's impact on the pandemic and presidential elections can be seen in the cases of various companies. For instance, McDonald's Corporation stock fell sharply by more than 25% between January and March 2020 as the coronavirus started to spread rapidly. Marriott International's stock experienced a similar drop, and the company furloughed tens of thousands of employees due to the pandemic's impact.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>As for the election, companies like Amazon and Facebook saw their shares fluctuate after the U.S. election was announced. While Facebook's shares fell, Amazon's shares increased, indicating that investors were uncertain about the market's future.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, the S&amp;P500 Futures' struggles despite cautious optimism about China and Russia's economies have left investors scratching their heads. With the pandemic and the U.S. election still affecting the market, it remains uncertain when the market will return to its previous glory. However, we can still derive some key conclusions from the current scenario.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Three key takeaways from the current scenario are:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant effect on the stock market, and the future of the market remains uncertain.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Political instability, such as the U.S. election, can also have a significant impact on the market, leading to uncertainty for investors.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Investing in the stock market remains a risk, with no guaranteed results even if the economy is doing well.</p>
