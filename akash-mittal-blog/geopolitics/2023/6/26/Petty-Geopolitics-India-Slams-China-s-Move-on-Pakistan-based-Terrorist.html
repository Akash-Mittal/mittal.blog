    <p>India has called out China for its "petty geopolitics" after it supported Pakistan-based terrorist Masood Azhar in a UN Security Council meeting recently. Masood Azhar is the founder and leader of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), a terrorist organization responsible for several attacks in India, including the 2019 Pulwama attack in which 40 Indian soldiers were killed.</p>
    <p>This move by China has not gone down well with India, which has been trying hard to get Masood Azhar designated as a global terrorist by the UN since 2009. The Indian government has accused China of blocking its attempts on several occasions in the past.</p>
    <h2>Examples of China's Support to Masood Azhar</h2>
    <p>In 2019, China was the only member of the 15-nation Security Council to block a proposal by the US, France, and the UK to designate Masood Azhar as a global terrorist. This move was widely criticized by the international community, including India and the US.</p>
    <p>In 2017, China again blocked India's proposal to ban Masood Azhar and his organization JeM, citing "lack of consensus" among the Security Council members. India had also submitted a dossier to the UN containing evidence of JeM's involvement in terrorist attacks in India.</p>
    <h2>Case Studies of China's Geopolitical Tactics</h2>
    <p>This incident is not the first time China has used its geopolitical influence to support rogue states and terrorist organizations. Here are a few examples:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>China has been supporting North Korea's nuclear weapon program despite international sanctions. It is North Korea's largest trading partner and provides it with food, fuel, and other essentials.</li>
     <li>China has been accused of supporting the Taliban in Afghanistan by providing them with arms, intelligence, and financial aid. China's support to the Taliban is seen as a way to counterbalance US influence in the region.</li>
     <li>China has been involved in territorial disputes in the South China Sea and the East China Sea, where it has claimed sovereignty over several islands and maritime territories. This has led to tensions with neighboring countries like Japan, Vietnam, and the Philippines.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion: India's Reaction and Three Key Points to Note</h2>
    <p>India has strongly condemned China's move to support Masood Azhar and called it a "disservice to the international community in the common fight against terrorism." India's Ministry of External Affairs issued a statement saying, "We hope China will reverse its position and join the international consensus on combating terrorism."</p>
    <p>Here are three key points to note from this incident:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>China's support to Masood Azhar is a clear indication of its double standards when it comes to the fight against terrorism. It is a major setback to India's efforts to bring Masood Azhar to justice.</li>
     <li>China's geopolitical tactics are increasingly becoming a threat to global stability and security. Its support to rogue states and non-state actors undermines the efforts of the international community to maintain peace and order.</li>
     <li>India needs to step up its diplomatic efforts to counter China's influence in international forums like the UN. It cannot afford to let China dictate the terms of the global agenda.</li>
