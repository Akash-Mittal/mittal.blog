   <h2>An Interesting Story on IndiGo Srinagar-Jammu Flight</h2>
   <p>On a bright sunny day, an IndiGo Srinagar-Jammu flight was on its way to reach the destination while crossing the border that separates India and Pakistan. Everything seemed to go well until the airplane crossed Pakistan airspace. Suddenly, the pilot received some alarming signals from the communication system. While trying to establish connections with the Pakistani Aviation Authority, the pilot realized that the airplane had entered Pakistan airspace without proper clearances and permissions. The incident sent a wave of shock in the aviation industry as the intrusion of one country's air territory into another can lead to serious geopolitical disputes.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Trespassing Airspaces</h2>
   <p>There have been several instances in the past where different countries have been involved in airspace violations. One of the most recent examples is the intrusion of Turkish fighter jets in Greek airspace in 2020. According to Greek authorities, Turkish jets violated the airspace over the Aegean Sea at least 31 times in a single day. Another example of violating airspace is the Indian Air Force attack on the Pakistani terror camps in Balakot in 2019. The Indian fighters entered the Pakistani airspace without any prior approvals, and the incident triggered a military conflict between the two neighboring countries.</p>
   <h2>A Case Study on Aviation Disputes Between India and Pakistan</h2>
   <p>The conflict between India and Pakistan over the air territory is not new. There have been several instances in the past where airspace has become a bone of contention between the neighboring countries. One such example is the hijack of Indian Airlines Flight 814 in 1999 by the Pakistan-based terror outfit, Jaish-e-Mohammed. The incident led to a 7-day standoff between India and Pakistan, and the Indian government had to release three terrorists to secure the release of 176 passengers and crew members.</p>
