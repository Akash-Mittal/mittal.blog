  <h1>When Obama Goes Low, Modi Goes High: The Art of Diplomacy</h1></br> <img src="images/When-Obama-goes-low-Modi-goes-high-The-New-Indian.jpeg" alt="+When-Obama-goes-low-Modi-goes-high-The-New-Indian+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://newindian.in/when-obama-goes-low-modi-goes-high/" target="_blank" href="https://newindian.in/when-obama-goes-low-modi-goes-high/" rel="noopener">https://newindian.in/when-obama-goes-low-modi-goes-high/</a></span></h5>
  <p>They say that politicians are some of the best actors. They can make us believe in their words, even if their actions speak louder. But there are some politicians who stand out in the way they execute their diplomatic strategies. One of them is former US President Barack Obama, and the other is the current Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi. They are both known for their unique approach to handling conflicts and achieving their goals. But when Obama goes low, Modi goes high.</p>
  <p>During the 2016 US Presidential elections, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton had a heated debate, with each one throwing mud at the other. In response, Obama said, "When they go low, we go high." This statement sent a powerful message to the American people, urging them to take the high road and choose integrity over mudslinging. And when it comes to diplomacy, Modi seems to have taken a page out of Obama's book.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Modi's Diplomatic Approach</h2>
  <p>Modi's style of diplomacy is often characterized by his ability to turn adversity into opportunity. Take, for instance, the Doklam standoff between India and China in 2017. China had sent its forces to build a road in Indian territory, causing tension between the two nations. Instead of escalating the situation, Modi decided to engage in a diplomatic approach, using quiet diplomacy to resolve the conflict. Eventually, China withdrew its troops, and India emerged as the winner.</p>
  <p>Another example of Modi's diplomacy can be seen in his approach towards Saudi Arabia, a country that has not always been friendly towards India. Modi reached out to Saudi Arabia, recognizing its strategic importance in the region. He showed respect for the country's culture and traditions, and in turn, was able to secure a $44 billion investment from Saudi Arabia in the Indian economy. This move not only strengthened India's economic ties with the Middle East but also helped to secure its energy security.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies of Modi's Diplomatic Strategies</h2>
  <p>One case study of Modi's diplomatic strategies can be seen in the way he handled the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA). The organization, which had been dormant for years, was reactivated under Modi's leadership. He saw an opportunity to bring the countries around the Indian Ocean together and work towards mutual goals. His approach of peaceful cooperation and joint development was well received by the nations, and the IORA was able to make significant progress under Modi's guidance.</p>
  <p>Another case study of Modi's diplomatic strategies can be seen in his approach towards Pakistan. Modi's government has taken a strong stance against cross-border terrorism and has made it clear that India will not tolerate any such attacks. However, instead of escalating the situation, Modi has been engaging in quiet diplomacy with Pakistan. This approach has been successful in preventing further escalation of the conflict and has allowed the two nations to work towards building a better relationship.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, Modi's diplomatic approach is a testimony to the fact that diplomacy can achieve better results than aggression. His approach of quiet diplomacy, respect for other cultures, and seeking opportunities in adversity has proved to be successful in achieving his goals. To sum up, here are three important points to remember:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Quiet diplomacy can be more effective than aggressive confrontation.</li>
   <li>Respect for other cultures and traditions can go a long way in building relationships.</li>
   <li>Turning adversity into opportunity is a hallmark of successful diplomacy.</li>
  </ol>
