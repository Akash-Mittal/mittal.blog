  <h1>Once upon a time, there was a land of peace and prosperity known as India. The land was known for its culture, traditions, and hospitality. However, as time passed, a neighboring country named Pakistan emerged as a threat to India's sovereignty. To add fuel to the fire, China, yet another neighboring country, has started showing its cozy relationship with Pakistan by deploying artillery to LoC and building bunkers opposite Indian army posts in PoK. This article will shed light on the current situation, provide case studies, and draw conclusions on how India can protect its borders.</h1></br> <img src="images/Once-upon-a-time-there-was-a-land-of-peace-and-prosperity-known-as-India-The-land-was-known-for-its.jpeg" alt="+Once-upon-a-time-there-was-a-land-of-peace-and-prosperity-known-as-India-The-land-was-known-for-its+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpsFEAQ6lho" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpsFEAQ6lho" rel="noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpsFEAQ6lho</a></span></h5>
  <p></p>
  <p>China's move to deploy artillery to LoC is not just a mere strategic move, it reveals that China stands with Pakistan against India. The LoC (Line of Control) is the de facto border between India and Pakistan that runs through Jammu and Kashmir. The deployment of artillery by China is a clear message that it wants Pakistan to showcase its aggressiveness towards India. Not to mention, Pakistan has intensified its activities in the valley of Kashmir. It has been reported that Pakistan has deployed an additional 50,000 troops to PoK (Pakistan-occupied Kashmir) to carry out its nefarious activities.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>If we talk about building bunkers opposite Indian army posts in PoK, it is a step taken by China to protect its interest in the region. The region in question is known for its rich natural resources and is a gateway to central Asia. With China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), it wants to expand its influence in the region at any cost.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In light of the current situation, India has to take steps to safeguard its sovereignty. India has several options to counter China's aggression. One option could be to increase its military presence in the region. Another option could be to look out for allies to counter the growing influence of China in the region.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>To understand the gravity of the situation, let's take an example of Doklam. In 2017, China tried to forcefully construct a road in Doklam, a region claimed by both China and Bhutan. India, being an ally of Bhutan, intervened and sent its troops to the region. The move resulted in a standoff between India and China for over 70 days. India showed its military might and stood firm on its stand, resulting in China withdrawing its troops from the region.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another case study is of the Galwan valley clash that took place in June 2020. Both India and China lay claim over the region. The clash between the two armies resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese soldiers. It was a stark reminder that China will go to any extent to protect its interests in the region.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Going forward, India needs to show its military might and increase its presence in the region. India should also engage other countries to counter the influence of China in the region. India has already formed QUAD, an alliance of countries such as India, Japan, Australia, and the United States, to counter the growing influence of China in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>China's aggression towards India is not just a territorial dispute, it is a power struggle in the region. With China showing its support towards Pakistan, India needs to remain vigilant and take strong steps to protect its sovereignty. To sum up, India needs to follow the following three-point agenda to counter China's aggression:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Increase its military presence in the region.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Look out for allies to counter the growing influence of China in the region.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Make strategic diplomatic moves to safeguard its sovereignty.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, China's move to deploy artillery to LoC and building bunkers opposite Indian army posts in PoK is a clear indication that China wants to protect its influence in the region. India needs to remain vigilant and take strong steps to safeguard its sovereignty. India can take cues from the Doklam standoff and Galwan valley clash to counter China's aggression. India needs to form alliances, increase its military presence, and make strategic diplomatic moves to protect its sovereignty.</p>
