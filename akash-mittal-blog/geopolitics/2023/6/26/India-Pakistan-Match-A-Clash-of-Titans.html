  <p>It was the year 1996, and the two neighboring countries, India and Pakistan, were to face each other in the Cricket World Cup quarter-finals. The hype and excitement were palpable among both sets of fans, and it was expected to be a fiercely contested game. I remember watching the match with my family, and as each wicket fell, the tension mounted. With just one over remaining, Pakistan required nine runs to win the game. However, the Indian captain threw the ball to an inexperienced bowler, and what followed was a stunning display of batting by the Pakistani batsman. They scored the required runs in just four balls, crushing the hopes of millions of Indian fans.</p>
