   <div class="story">
    <p>On a regular day, passengers on board a flight from Srinagar to Delhi were taken by surprise when their IndiGo flight entered Pakistan airspace. The situation was unbelievable, but it was happening right before their eyes. The flight, which had been cleared for takeoff from Srinagar airport, was now flying over a different country.</p>
    <p>The passengers were fearful and unsure of what was happening. However, the flight crew informed them that the situation was under control, and the flight would be landing in Amritsar, India shortly.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="examples">
    <h2>Examples of Similar Incidents</h2>
    <p>Although rare, similar incidents have happened in the past. In 2019, Pakistan had closed its airspace to all commercial flights following military tensions with India. A flight from New Delhi to London, which usually flies over Pakistan, had to be rerouted over the Arabian Sea, causing a significant delay.</p>
    <p>In 2020, an AirAsia flight from Malaysia to India had to make an emergency landing in Kolkata after entering Bhutanese airspace. The flight, which was carrying over a hundred passengers, had landed safely, and all passengers were uninjured.</p>
    <p>These incidents show that aviation, despite its strict safety protocols, can still face unforeseeable situations. However, it is the responsibility of the airline company to make sure passengers are safe and kept informed of all developments.</p>

   <div class="case-studies">
    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <h3>IndiGo Airlines</h3>
    <p>IndiGo Airlines is India's largest airline by passengers carried and fleet size. It has a rigorous safety protocol that includes regular training of flight crew, ground staff, and maintenance personnel. In this incident, IndiGo Airlines immediately informed the Air Traffic Control in Amritsar and was rerouted, making an emergency landing to ensure passenger safety.</p>
    <h3>AirAsia</h3>
    <p>AirAsia is a Malaysian airline with the motto 'Now Everyone Can Fly.' It has won numerous awards for its safety protocols and has a policy of absolute transparency with its passengers. When the flight from Malaysia to India encountered trouble, it had immediately informed the passengers and crew onboard, making an emergency landing, and providing necessary support and aid.</p>
    <h3>British Airways</h3>
    <p>British Airways is the national airline of the United Kingdom and one of the largest airlines in the world. It has a commendable safety record, and its flight crews are trained to handle various unforeseeable situations. In May 2013, a British Airways flight was forced to make an emergency landing in London Heathrow after an engine caught fire mid-air. The flight crew managed to land the plane safely, and all passengers were evacuated without any injuries.</p>
