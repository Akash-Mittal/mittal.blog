   <p>It was a warm day in March 2021 when the world woke up to the news that the Chinese government had committed a heinous act of human rights violation against the Uighur Muslims living in the Xinjiang region. The news spread like wildfire and soon the world was outraged at China's action. People all over the world condemned China and called for a boycott of Chinese products and services. Formula 1, the most popular motor racing sport in the world could not remain aloof to these developments and soon announced that it is looking to boycott China.</p>
   <p>The news was welcomed by many and criticized by others. Some people felt that sports should not be used for political purposes, while others felt that sports and politics are intertwined and that boycotting China is the right thing to do. Formula 1 had to make a difficult choice, and it decided to stand on the side of human rights and boycott China.</p>
   <h2>Why Qatar and Saudi then?</h2>
   <p>The decision to boycott China had huge ramifications for Formula 1. The Chinese Grand Prix, which was supposed to be held in April 2021 had to be cancelled. The sport needed to find a replacement for the event, and it turned to Qatar and Saudi Arabia. The two countries were more than happy to step in, and they soon became the venues for the Formula 1 racing events.</p>
   <p>Qatar and Saudi Arabia are two countries that are not new to Formula 1. Both countries have hosted Formula 1 events in the past and are known for their love for the sport. Qatar has hosted events in 2004 and 2005, while Saudi Arabia hosted the first-ever Formula E race in 2018. Thus, it was not surprising that Formula 1 turned to these two countries to replace China.</p>
   <h2>Formula 1 Boycott China: Case Studies</h2>
   <p>The decision of Formula 1 to boycott China is not the first time that sports have been used for political purposes. In the past, several countries have been boycotted by sports teams and athletes. Some of the famous cases are:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>The 1980 Moscow Olympics:</strong> Several countries including the USA, Canada, and Japan boycotted the Moscow Olympics in protest against the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan.</li>
    <li><strong>The 1996 Atlanta Olympics:</strong> Several countries including Cuba, North Korea, and Iran boycotted the Atlanta Olympics in protest against the USA's anti-Cuba policies.</li>
    <li><strong>The 2018 Winter Olympics:</strong> Several countries including Russia were banned from participating in the 2018 Winter Olympics due to the country's involvement in doping scandals.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>These cases show that sports and politics are intertwined, and that sports can be used as a means to promote political agendas.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion in 3 points</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Formula 1's decision to boycott China is a bold and courageous move that highlights the sport's commitment to human rights.</li>
    <li>Qatar and Saudi Arabia have stepped in as replacements, and they are known for their love for the sport, making them ideal candidates for the events.</li>
    <li>The decision to boycott China is not the first time that sports have been used for political purposes, and it is likely that such boycotts will continue in the future.</li>
