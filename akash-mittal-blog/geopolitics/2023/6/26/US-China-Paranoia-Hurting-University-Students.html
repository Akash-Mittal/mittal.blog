  <h1>US-China ‘Paranoia' Hurting University Students</h1></br> <img src="images/US-China-Paranoia-Hurting-University-Students.jpeg" alt="+US-China-Paranoia-Hurting-University-Students+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/us-china-paranoia-hurting-universities-and-students" target="_blank" href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/us-china-paranoia-hurting-universities-and-students" rel="noopener">https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/us-china-paranoia-hurting-universities-and-students</a></span></h5>
  <p>According to recent reports, around 300,000 Chinese students are studying in universities across the United States. However, in recent years, the US-China rivalry has been a cause for concern among many of these students. They are worried that this growing "paranoia" between the two countries could have a negative impact on their educational opportunities, career prospects, and even mental health.</p>
  <p>There have been several instances where Chinese students have been accused of spying and stealing US intellectual property, which has led to increased scrutiny and uncertainty in their daily lives. For instance, in March this year, a Chinese student at the University of California was sentenced to prison for stealing next-generation tech from a US-based company. This case further fueled the paranoia surrounding Chinese students, and many of them have started feeling targeted and unfairly treated.</p>
  <p>The situation is even worse for those students studying STEM subjects. A survey conducted by the Committee of 100, a non-profit Chinese-American organization, found that 20% of Chinese-Americans working in STEM fields have experienced discrimination at work. Such incidents not only affect the students' academic performances but also cause them tremendous mental stress, which can lead to serious mental health issues in the long run.</p>

   <h2>Case Study: Tianwei Wei</h2>
   <p>Tianwei Wei, a Chinese student studying at the University of Michigan, is one of many students who have been affected by this "US-China paranoia." He says he was once pulled aside by airport security officials who questioned him about his intentions in the US. His background and past experiences were thoroughly scrutinized, and he was only allowed to proceed after several hours of questioning.</p>
   <p>Wei says such incidents are not new to him. He has faced racism and discrimination several times while studying in the US. He feels that his educational opportunities and career prospects are being limited because of his Chinese background. He says it's not fair that he has to prove his innocence repeatedly, just because of where he comes from.</p>
   <p>Wei's story is just one of many such cases. The paranoia surrounding US-China relations is hurting many talented students who are simply trying to fulfill their academic dreams and achieve their career goals. It is high time that both countries take concrete steps to address these concerns and create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for international students.</p>

   <h2>Case Study: Xinyue Liu</h2>
   <p>Xinyue Liu, a graduate student at the University of California, says that the overall atmosphere on campus has become increasingly tense and hostile towards Chinese students. She recalls an incident where a professor asked her about her political views just because she was from China. Liu says she was shocked and did not know how to respond.</p>
   <p>She further adds that many Chinese students are afraid to voice their opinions about sensitive issues, such as the Hong Kong protests or the Uighur crisis, for fear of being targeted. This has led to a sense of isolation and exclusion among Chinese students, who feel like they are being treated as second-class citizens.</p>
   <p>According to Liu, the US administration's policies towards China and the ongoing trade war have only exacerbated the situation. She feels that US-China relations are at a tipping point, and it's the students who are suffering the most.</p>
