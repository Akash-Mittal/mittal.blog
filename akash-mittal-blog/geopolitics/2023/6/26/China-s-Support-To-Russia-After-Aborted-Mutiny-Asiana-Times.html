    <p>On the night of June 16, 2021, a group of Russian army officers attempted a mutiny against the government. The plan was to overthrow President Vladimir Putin and install a provisional government. However, the coup was foiled, and the officers were arrested.</p>
    <p>After the news spread, the world was on the edge, with many nations trying to understand the situation and what it meant for them. China, on the other hand, was quick to show its support for Russia.</p>
    <h2>Examples of China's Support</h2>
    <p>China's support for Russia came in different forms. Some of these included:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Sending a message of support to Putin: After the aborted mutiny, China's President, Xi Jinping, sent a message of support to President Putin. In the message, he expressed his country's full support for Russia's sovereignty and political stability.</li>
     <li>Not condemning Russia: Many countries, including the US and EU, condemned Russia's actions. However, China chose not to follow suit. This move showed its solidarity with Russia, even when most of the world was against it.</li>
     <li>Offering to help: China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that it was willing to offer Russia any assistance it needed. This help could be in the form of mediation between Russia and the West or any other support that Putin might need.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>China's support for Russia is not new. The two nations have a long history of diplomatic and economic cooperation. Some of the case studies that show the depth of their friendship include:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Energy cooperation: China is the world's largest energy consumer, and Russia is one of the largest producers of oil and gas. The two countries have thus worked together to strengthen their energy ties. One example of this is the construction of the Power of Siberia pipeline, which transports gas from Russia to China.</li>
     <li>Military cooperation: China and Russia have also cooperated on military matters. The two countries have conducted joint naval drills and signed several arms deals. This cooperation has helped both countries to strengthen their defense capabilities.</li>
     <li>Bilateral trade: In 2020, China became Russia's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $107 billion. This trade relationship has helped both countries to boost their economies and create jobs.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, China's support for Russia after the aborted mutiny shows the strength of their friendship and the depth of their cooperation. Despite pressure from other countries to distance itself from Russia, China chose to stand by its friend. This move has further strengthened the bond between the two countries and will have long-lasting geopolitical implications.</p>
