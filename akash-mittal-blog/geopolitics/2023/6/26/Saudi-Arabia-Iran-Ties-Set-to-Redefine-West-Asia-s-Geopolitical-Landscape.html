   <p>In 2015, Saudi Arabia and Iran were embroiled in a diplomatic spat that had the potential to destabilize the entire region. It all began when Saudi Arabia executed a prominent Shia cleric, causing outrage and protests in Iran. The Saudi embassy in Tehran was ransacked and Saudi Arabia broke off diplomatic ties with Iran. This event marked a turning point in the relationship between these two Islamic powerhouses. However, recent developments suggest that a rapprochement may be in the works.</p><!--Add some examples-->
   <h2>Examples of Changing Dynamics</h2>
   <p>In early September 2021, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman stated in an interview that he wanted to "build good relations with Iran". This was a significant departure from previous statements where he had called Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei "the new Hitler of the Middle East". Iran also responded positively, with Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh stating that Iran welcomed "serious talks" with Saudi Arabia. Another example of changing dynamics is the recent report of secret meetings between high-level officials from both countries. These meetings, held in Iraq, were reportedly facilitated by Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi.</p><!--Add case studies-->
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <h3>Syria</h3>
   <p>One of the main areas where Saudi Arabia and Iran have been in direct competition is Syria. Saudi Arabia has been a major supporter of the Syrian opposition while Iran has been backing the Assad government. This has led to a protracted conflict that has killed countless civilians and displaced millions of people. However, a potential rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran could lead to a resolution of the Syrian conflict.</p>
   <h3>Yemen</h3>
   <p>Another area of direct competition between Saudi Arabia and Iran is Yemen. Saudi Arabia has been leading a coalition of Arab countries against the Iran-backed Houthi rebels. This conflict has also resulted in significant loss of life and widespread destruction. A resolution of the conflict would require the involvement of Iran, which Saudi Arabia has been reluctant to accept. A potential rapprochement between these two countries could provide a path towards resolving the Yemeni conflict.</p><!--Add conclusion in 3 points-->
