    <p>It was a sunny day in New York. Tens of thousands of people were gathered in the Madison Square Garden to hear India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, speak. The atmosphere was electric. The ground was shaking with loud chants of "Modi, Modi"</p>
    <p>Modi was the first Indian Prime Minister ever to visit the United States, and his visit was highly anticipated. He was there to address the United Nations General Assembly and to meet with President Obama. But, it was not just the Indian diaspora that was excited about Modi's visit. China was too, for all the wrong reasons.</p>

    <h2>Everything China Hates</h2>
    <p>Modi's US visit was everything China hates. China hates India's growing diplomatic clout and its efforts to counterbalance China in the region. China sees India as a rival and has always been wary of India's growing ties with the United States.</p>
    <p>During Modi's visit, India and the United States signed several agreements on defense cooperation, clean energy, and the economy. These deals are critical to India's national security and economic growth, but they also demonstrate India's commitment to the United States, something China cannot ignore.</p>

    <h2>China's Response</h2>
    <p>China's response to Modi's US visit was predictable. It criticized the agreements, calling them "concerning" and accused India of "having a Cold War mentality". The Chinese media was quick to point out that these deals were part of a larger plan by the United States to encircle China.</p>
    <p>China also called Joe Biden's speech at the University of Pennsylvania, where he praised India's democracy and Modi's leadership, "wishful thinking".</p>

    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <h3>South China Sea Dispute</h3>
    <p>The South China Sea dispute is one of the biggest geopolitical issues in Asia. China claims almost the entire South China Sea, including territory claimed by other countries such as the Philippines and Vietnam. India, which has its own disputes with China over border issues, has been vocal in its support for all countries to have freedom of navigation and peaceful resolution of disputes.</p>
    <p>The United States has also provided support to countries such as the Philippines and Vietnam, both militarily and economically, to counter China's aggressive stance on the disputed islands. India's support in this matter is seen as critical as it has the potential to change the balance of power in the region.</p>
    <h3>Quad Alliance</h3>
    <p>The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad, is an informal strategic forum comprising India, the United States, Japan, and Australia. It was established in 2007 but was disbanded in 2008 due to Chinese pressure.</p>
    <p>However, in recent years, the Quad has gained momentum as a means to counter China's growing influence in the region. India, which sees itself as a rising power in Asia, has been an important partner in this effort. The Quad has held several meetings to discuss security issues, including the pandemic, the South China Sea, and the 5G network.</p>
