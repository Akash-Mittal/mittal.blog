   <p>It was a cloudy day in New York City when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived for his official visit to the United States. The visit was high-profile, with discussions between Modi and US President Joe Biden expected to revolve around China. Both countries share concerns about China's role in the global economy, its human rights record, and its militarization of the South China Sea. But the visit would turn out to be more fruitful than expected, with the two leaders announcing important agreements in other areas, including climate change and cyber security.</p>
   <p>The Modi-Biden meeting marked the first in-person summit between leaders of the two countries since the COVID-19 pandemic began. In the months leading up to the meeting, both sides had been working to strengthen their bilateral relationship amid rising pressure from China. Indian officials had expressed concerns about China's aggressive military posture on the country's northern and eastern borders, while US officials had been worried about China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region, which has been underscored by its expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea.</p>
   <p>Modi's visit to the United States was a reflection of India's growing importance on the global stage. In recent years, India has emerged as a key player in the Indo-Pacific region, with its strategic location between China and Southeast Asia giving it an important role in the region's security and economic affairs. At the same time, India has sought to deepen its ties with other countries, including the United States, in an effort to counterbalance China's growing power.</p>
   <h2>Examples of India-US Alignment on China</h2>
   <p>During Modi's visit, the two leaders announced several agreements that demonstrated the growing alignment between India and the United States on matters related to China. Notably, the leaders announced the Quad's first in-person summit, which would include the Japanese Prime Minister and the Australian Prime Minister. Quad is a strategic coalition between four countries- India, Japan, the United States, and the Australia intended to counter Chinese expansionism in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
   <p>In addition, the two countries agreed to deepen cooperation on climate change, which is an issue of global concern. Modi and Biden announced the launch of a new partnership on climate resilience and adaptation, which is aimed at helping vulnerable countries cope with the impacts of climate change. The leaders also agreed to strengthen their cooperation on cybersecurity, an area of growing concern as more and more activities move online.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies: How India is Countering Chinese Influence</h2>
   <p>India is not the only country looking to counter China's growing influence in the region. Several other countries in the Indo-Pacific, including Japan and Australia, have also been working to strengthen their strategic ties with one another and with the United States. In recent years, these efforts have taken on a greater sense of urgency as China has become more assertive in the region, particularly in the South China Sea.</p>
   <p>One example of how India is countering Chinese influence is its efforts to improve its connectivity with other countries in the region. India has invested in a variety of infrastructure projects, including the International North-South Transport Corridor, which aims to connect India with Iran, Russia, and other Central Asian countries. India is also working with Japan to develop infrastructure projects in Southeast Asia, with the goal of improving connectivity and reducing dependence on China.</p>
   <p>Another way India is countering Chinese influence is by deepening its economic ties with other countries. India has been working to enhance its trade and investment relationships with Japan, South Korea, and other countries in the region. This strategy is aimed at diversifying India's economic partnerships and reducing its dependence on China, which is currently India's largest trading partner.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion: Three Key Takeaways</h2>
   <p>Modi's visit to the United States has underscored the growing importance of the India-US relationship in the Indo-Pacific region. With China's rise changing the regional dynamics, India and the United States have found it necessary to deepen their ties and work together on issues of common concern. Here are three key takeaways from the Modi-Biden meeting:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>India is emerging as a key player in the Indo-Pacific region, with its strategic location giving it an important role in the region's security and economic affairs.</li>
    <li>The United States and India are working to deepen their strategic partnership, including on issues related to China.</li>
    <li>The Quad's in-person summit and the launch of the partnership on climate resilience and adaptation are both significant developments that underscore the growing alignment between India and the United States on matters related to China.</li>
