  <h1>Beijing looms large as Modi visits White House</h1></br> <img src="images/Beijing-looms-large-as-Modi-visits-White-House.jpeg" alt="+Beijing-looms-large-as-Modi-visits-White-House+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/india-us-relations-06222023162455.html" target="_blank" href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/india-us-relations-06222023162455.html" rel="noopener">https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/india-us-relations-06222023162455.html</a></span></h5>
  <p>Many world leaders have visited the White House over the years, but the recent visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has captured the world's attention. The reason for this is not necessarily because of Modi's visit, but because of the larger geopolitical tensions in the region.</p>
  <p>China, which is India's neighbor to the north, has been a major focus of Modi's visit. Although there is no formal alliance between the US and India, both countries have a shared interest in countering China's growing influence.</p>
  <p>China is the world's second-largest economy and is rapidly expanding its military and technological power. It has also been using its economic strength to influence other countries and regions, such as Southeast Asia and Africa. This has led to concerns among other world powers, including the US and India, about China's geopolitical ambitions.</p>
  <h2>Examples of China's growing influence</h2>
  <p>One example of China's growing influence can be seen in the Indian Ocean region. China has been building its naval presence in the region and has established a military base in Djibouti, which is located near India's western coast. This has raised concerns among Indian officials about the potential for China to disrupt shipping and other key economic activities in the region.</p>
  <p>Another example of China's influence can be seen in Central Asia, where Beijing has established a major economic presence. China has invested heavily in oil and gas exploration in the region and has also built a major transportation network linking Central Asia to its eastern provinces. This has given China greater access to key resources, while also allowing it to expand its economic and political influence in the region.</p>
  <h2>Case studies</h2>
  <h3>India-Japan-US trilateral partnership</h3>
  <p>One example of international cooperation to counter China's growing influence is the trilateral partnership between India, Japan, and the US. This partnership aims to promote economic growth, freedom of navigation, and security in the Indo-Pacific region. By working together, these countries hope to balance China's power and prevent it from becoming too dominant in the region.</p>
  <h3>China-India border dispute</h3>
  <p>The ongoing border dispute between China and India is another example of the challenges presented by China's rise. The two countries have been engaged in a long-standing territorial dispute in the Himalayan region, which has led to military clashes and tensions in recent years. This dispute highlights the challenges faced by other countries in the region as they seek to balance their own interests with China's growing power and influence.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>China's growing power and influence is a major concern for many countries in the region, including India and the US.</li>
   <li>International cooperation and partnerships, such as the India-Japan-US trilateral partnership, may be necessary to counterbalance China's influence.</li>
   <li>The ongoing border dispute between China and India highlights the challenges faced by other countries in the region as they seek to balance their own interests with China's growing power and influence.</li>
