   <p>In today's world of diplomacy, words are often used to build relationships and strengthen ties between countries. However, in the case of China-U.S. relations, actions speak louder than words.</p>
   <p>Let's explore some examples:</p>
   <h2>Example 1: Trade</h2>
   <p>For years, the U.S. has accused China of unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft. Meanwhile, China has been accusing the U.S. of using trade as a tool to contain China's rise in the global economy.</p>
   <p>In 2020, China and the U.S. signed phase one of a trade agreement aimed at reducing tensions in the trade relationship. The deal included commitments from China to increase its purchases of American goods and services, and the U.S. agreed to reduce some tariffs on Chinese imports. However, soon after, the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and tensions rose once again.</p>
   <p>With the pandemic still ongoing, both countries have been struggling to maintain their economies. China's trade surplus with the U.S. has been rising, and the U.S. has been placing restrictions on Chinese companies, such as Huawei, citing national security concerns.</p>
   <p>The actions of both countries show that trade tensions have not subsided, and that words alone cannot resolve them.</p>
   <h2>Example 2: COVID-19</h2>
   <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire world, and China was no exception. In the early stages of the outbreak, the Chinese government faced criticism for not being transparent about the severity of the virus and for suppressing information.</p>
   <p>However, China also took decisive action to control the spread of the virus, including placing entire cities under lockdown and building new hospitals in record time. When the virus began to spread beyond China's borders, China started sending medical supplies and equipment to affected countries, including the U.S.</p>
   <p>Despite these actions, the U.S. has continued to blame China for the pandemic and has accused China of not doing enough to prevent the virus from spreading. Meanwhile, China has accused the U.S. of using the pandemic to stoke anti-China sentiment and as an excuse to restrict Chinese companies from doing business in the U.S.</p>
   <p>These actions suggest that while China took action to help fight the pandemic, the U.S.-China relationship has not improved, as both countries continue to blame each other for the crisis.</p>
   <h2>Case Study: Taiwan</h2>
   <p>The issue of Taiwan has been a sensitive one in China-U.S. relations. China claims Taiwan as a part of its territory and has been pushing for reunification, while the U.S. has been providing support to Taiwan, including selling arms.</p>
   <p>In 2018, the U.S. passed the Taiwan Travel Act, which encouraged high-level visits between Taiwan and the U.S. government. This move angered China, which sees Taiwan as a red line and a non-negotiable issue.</p>
   <p>More recently, China has been conducting military drills near Taiwan, and the U.S. has been sending military ships and planes through the Taiwan Strait. These actions suggest that the issue of Taiwan remains a potential flashpoint in China-U.S. relations.</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Actions are more important than words in building relationships between countries.</li>
    <li>The examples of trade and COVID-19 show that the U.S.-China relationship remains tense, despite efforts to improve it.</li>
    <li>The issue of Taiwan remains a potential source of conflict between China and the U.S.</li>
   </ol>
