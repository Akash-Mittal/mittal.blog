   <p>Once upon a time in Italy, Giorgia Meloni, the leader of the far-right party Brothers of Italy, was known for her anti-immigrant rhetoric, pro-life stance, and Euroscepticism. She was seen as a rising figure in the Italian political scene, challenging the established parties and appealing to a growing number of voters who felt disenchanted with the mainstream politics.</p>
   <p>But then something happened. Meloni started to change her tone. She softened her rhetoric on immigration, supported vaccination campaigns, and even expressed her willingness to join forces with the mainstream parties. Many of her supporters were confused and disappointed. They felt like their leader had betrayed them.</p>
   <p>But what had caused Meloni's transformation? Was it just a matter of political opportunism, or were there other factors at play?</p>

   <h2>Neoliberalism, Geopolitics, and Ideology</h2>
   <p>In order to understand what happened to Giorgia Meloni, we need to examine the broader socio-political context in which she operates. Specifically, we need to look at the role of neoliberalism, geopolitics, and ideology.</p>
   <h3>Neoliberalism</h3>
   <p>Neoliberalism is an economic ideology that emphasizes free market capitalism, privatization, deregulation, and austerity. It is often associated with the policies of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which have promoted a neoliberal agenda in developing countries through structural adjustment programs.</p>
   <p>In the case of Italy, neoliberalism has been embraced by the mainstream parties, especially the center-left Democratic Party. This has led to the privatization of public services, the erosion of workers' rights, and the widening of social inequality.</p>
   <p>However, neoliberalism has also created economic opportunities for some individuals and groups, such as entrepreneurs and investors. These groups tend to support the parties and politicians that promote neoliberal policies.</p>
   <p>Giorgia Meloni, as a leader of a far-right party, was initially critical of neoliberalism. She presented herself as a defender of the working class and the national economy against the tyranny of global capital. However, as she became more politically ambitious, she started to realize that she needed to appeal to the neoliberal elites if she wanted to gain power.</p>
   <h3>Geopolitics</h3>
   <p>Geopolitics is the study of the relationship between politics and geography. It examines how the distribution of power and resources across different regions of the world affects global politics.</p>
   <p>In the case of Italy, geopolitics is shaped by its location at the crossroads of Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. Italy has been a major gateway for immigrants and refugees from these regions, which has led to tensions with its European partners and neighboring countries.</p>
   <p>Giorgia Meloni, as a leader of a far-right party, was initially vocal about her opposition to immigration and her desire to protect the Italian identity. However, as she became more politically savvy, she realized that Italy needed to maintain good relations with its neighbors and allies if it wanted to achieve its geopolitical goals.</p>
   <h3>Ideology</h3>
   <p>Ideology is a set of beliefs and values that shape a person's worldview and political preferences. It includes ideas about justice, freedom, democracy, and equality.</p>
   <p>Giorgia Meloni, as a leader of a far-right party, was initially associated with a populist and nationalist ideology that emphasized the primacy of the nation over global institutions. However, as she became more politically ambitious, she started to embrace a more moderate and pragmatic ideology that emphasized the need for compromise and cooperation.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <p>To illustrate how neoliberalism, geopolitics, and ideology have influenced Giorgia Meloni's political trajectory, we can examine some of her recent actions and statements.</p>
   <h3>Softening Rhetoric on Immigration</h3>
   <p>Giorgia Meloni has recently expressed her support for legal immigration, arguing that it can be beneficial for the Italian economy. She has even praised the government's decision to grant citizenship to the children of immigrants who were born and raised in Italy.</p>
   <p>This marks a significant shift from her earlier stance, which was highly critical of immigration and refugees. This change can be attributed to the influence of neoliberal elites, who recognize the economic benefits of immigration, and the geopolitical realities of Italy's relationship with its neighbors.</p>
   <h3>Supporting Vaccination Campaigns</h3>
   <p>Giorgia Meloni has recently expressed her support for vaccination campaigns, arguing that they are necessary to protect public health. This is a departure from her previous anti-vaxxer stance, which was based on her skepticism of the scientific community and her belief in individual freedom.</p>
   <p>This change can be attributed to the influence of mainstream politicians and public health experts, who recognize the importance of vaccinations in preventing the spread of diseases and ensuring public safety.</p>
   <h3>Expressing Willingness to Join Forces with Mainstream Parties</h3>
   <p>Giorgia Meloni has recently expressed her willingness to join forces with the mainstream parties, especially the center-right Forza Italia, in order to form a coalition government. This marks a significant shift from her earlier stance, which was highly critical of the establishment and its political correctness.</p>
   <p>This change can be attributed to the influence of pragmatic politicians and political insiders, who recognize the need for compromise and cooperation in order to achieve political goals.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>Giorgia Meloni's transformation from a far-right firebrand to a more moderate, pragmatic politician can be attributed to the influence of neoliberalism, geopolitics, and ideology. As she becomes more politically ambitious, she recognizes that she needs to appeal to the interests of different groups and adjust her stance accordingly.</p>
   <p>However, this transformation has also alienated some of her original supporters, who feel like she has betrayed their beliefs and values. This highlights the tension between political expediency and political authenticity, and raises questions about the role of ideology in contemporary politics.</p>
