  <p>It is no secret that the mainstream media all over the world has a significant impact on shaping public perception. Announcements, news, and reports disseminated by media outlets can either create or break economies, policies, global relationships, or even decide how an average person thinks about opposing nations. Therefore, people believe what they hear, read, or see in the media. However, media's role in spreading lies, propaganda, and unverified information is not unknown.</p>
  <p>Recently, the world witnessed a significant probe that unveiled Indian media's fabrication of news on Pakistan and China. The inquiry proved that Indian media channels, newspapers, and digital portals ran propaganda and misinformation campaigns regarding the neighboring countries. This report exposed the vulnerabilities of media's power to shape opinions and decisions.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Indian Media Fabrication of News</h2>
  <p>Indian media's hate-filled reports on Pakistan and China need no introduction, but the fabricated news spread by Indian media on these countries, which was thought to be genuine, is what the probe revealed. Following are some instances of Indian media's fabricated news:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>The Bogus News of IAF Shooting Down Pakistan's F-16</strong><br>
     In 2019, after the Balakot skirmish, Indian media and government announced that the Indian Air Force (IAF) shot down Pakistan's F-16 fighter jet. However, the USA's case study on the incident revealed that no Pakistani F-16 was shot down that day. Nevertheless, Indian media continued to publish articles and run shows propagating the statement.</li>
   <li><strong>False Information on Chinese Products</strong><br>
     During the Galwan Valley skirmish, the Indian government and media ran news that people should avoid buying Chinese products. For instance, in June 2020, Indian media reported that Chinese-made condoms were too small for Indian men and wouldn't be effective. However, the report was found to be inaccurate, and the condom manufacturer said that they don't even market their products in India.</li>
   <li><strong>Misinformation on Pakistan's COVID-19 Situation</strong><br>
     In early 2020, when the world was grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, Indian media ran a report stating that Pakistan had five times more cases than officially reported, and the country was under-reporting cases to avoid criticism. However, the report had no basis, and the numbers were fake.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Case Studies of Indian Media's Fabrication of News</h2>
  <p>Below are some case studies to demonstrate how some Indian media outlets spread propaganda regarding Pakistan and China:</p>
  <h3>Coronavirus Outbreak Blamed on the Muslims of Tablighi Jamaat</h3>
  <p>In April 2020, the Indian media channels and newspapers blamed Tablighi Jamaat, an Islamic missionary organization for the rapid rise in COVID cases and deaths in the country. They accused the organization of spreading the virus deliberately. The news resulted in outbreaks of hate and harassment towards the Muslim community in India.</p>
  <p>However, the news was found to be fabricated, and the Delhi Police filed an FIR against several media channels for their false news reporting. Furthermore, an inquiry report by the Ministry of Health also showed that Tablighi Jamaat was not the source of the virus's spread.</p>
  <h3>Fake News on China's Involvement in Nepal's Political Crisis</h3>
  <p>In May 2021, Indian media channels and newspapers reported that China was meddling with Nepal's political crisis, where the Nepalese Prime Minister was removed from power. The Indian media accused China of creating unrest in Nepal and intervened in the political matters of the country.</p>
  <p>The news was found to be completely baseless, and the Chinese embassy in Kathmandu called the report "nonsense." The Nepalese foreign ministry also issued a statement saying that their relations with China were bilateral and non-interfering in each others' affairs.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion in 3 points</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, the probe on Indian media's fabrication of news on Pakistan and China showed that media outlets can't be relied upon for accurate information, and their reporting shouldn't be taken as gospel truth. The investigation evidenced that:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Media's power to create opinions and narratives can be dangerous and malicious.</li>
   <li>Media should be held accountable for spreading fake and fabricated news and their repercussions.</li>
   <li>People should cross-check and verify any news before accepting it as facts.</li>
  </ol>
