    <p>As Prime Minister Narendra Modi gets ready for his much-awaited visit to the United States, one issue is dominating the conversation - the US-China equation. With tensions between the two superpowers at an all-time high, and with India trying to navigate its relationship with both countries, will the US-China equation be the elephant in the room during Modi's visit?</p>
    <p>The answer is a resounding yes.</p>
    <p>But before we delve into the details of the US-China equation, let's start with an interesting story about the relationship between India and the US.</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>In 1998, India conducted nuclear tests that caused an uproar around the world. The US, which was trying to forge closer ties with India at the time, imposed economic sanctions on India in response.</p>
     <p>Fast forward to 2005, when President George W. Bush visited India. During a joint press conference with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, a reporter asked Bush about the sanctions and whether they had hurt the US-India relationship. Bush replied:</p>
     <blockquote>
      "The people of India are united in their determination not to have their sovereignty, or their security, or their economic progress threatened. I think it is important for the United States administration to recognize that the Indian people have made a sovereign decision to exercise what is their right."
     </blockquote>
     <p>This statement marked a turning point in the US-India relationship, and set the stage for the strong partnership that exists between the two countries today.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>The US-China equation has been a major issue for India in recent years, and there are several examples that illustrate this point:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>The US-China trade war has impacted India's economy, particularly its manufacturing sector. With China facing tariffs on its exports to the US, it has begun to look elsewhere to sell its goods, including India.</li>
     <li>The US-China rivalry in the Indo-Pacific region has put pressure on India to choose sides. The US has been urging India to join its efforts to counter China's growing influence in the region, while China has been trying to lure India into its own sphere of influence.</li>
     <li>The US has also been trying to convince India to reduce its imports of oil from Iran and instead buy more from the US. However, India has been reluctant to do so, as it depends heavily on Iranian oil.</li>
    </ul>

   <section id="case-studies">
    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>Two recent events highlight the challenges that India faces in navigating the US-China equation:</p>
    <h3>Case Study 1: India's Decision on Huawei</h3>
    <p>In May 2019, the US government blacklisted Chinese tech giant Huawei, alleging that it posed a threat to national security. The move was seen as part of the broader US-China trade war, and it put pressure on other countries to follow suit. India, which is a major market for Huawei's smartphones, was faced with a difficult decision. Should it support the US and ban Huawei from doing business in India, or should it continue to work with Huawei and risk angering the US?</p>
    <p>In the end, India decided to allow Huawei to participate in 5G trials in the country. This decision was seen as a signal to the US that India would not simply do its bidding, and that it had its own interests to consider.</p>
    <h3>Case Study 2: India's Response to the Quad</h3>
    <p>The Quad is a grouping of four countries - the US, Japan, India, and Australia - that was formed in 2007 to promote regional cooperation. In recent years, the Quad has gained new significance as a way to counter China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region. However, India has been cautious about taking a confrontational approach towards China, and has been reluctant to be seen as part of an anti-China coalition.</p>
    <p>During the 2020 Quad summit, India's External Affairs Minister, S. Jaishankar, emphasized that the Quad should not be seen as a military alliance, and that India did not see it as a group that was targeted against any particular country.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>So, what can we expect from Modi's visit to the US, and how will the US-China equation impact India?</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Modi is likely to emphasize India's strategic importance as a counterweight to China in the Indo-Pacific region. He may also seek to deepen economic ties with the US, particularly in areas such as technology and defense.</li>
     <li>India will continue to balance its relationship with the US and China, and will seek to maintain its independence and autonomy in foreign policy decision-making.</li>
     <li>The US-China equation will remain a major challenge for India, and will require careful diplomacy and strategic thinking to navigate.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In conclusion, as India seeks to assert itself on the global stage, it will need to engage with both the US and China in a nuanced and thoughtful way. The US-China equation may be the elephant in the room during Modi's visit, but India has the potential to emerge as a key player in this changing geopolitical landscape.</p>
