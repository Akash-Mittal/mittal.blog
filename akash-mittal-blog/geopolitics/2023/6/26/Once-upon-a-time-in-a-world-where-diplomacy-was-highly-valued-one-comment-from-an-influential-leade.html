  <p></p>
  <p>This development has raised concerns amongst political pundits all over the world. Some believe that this may trigger a diplomatic war that could have widespread economic, social, and political implications across the globe. In light of this recent development, this article unravels what led to Joe Biden's statement, reactions from China, implications, and what other countries should expect from both countries.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Why Biden labelled Xi Jinping a dictator?</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>On 16 February 2021, Joe Biden, while addressing a CNN town hall meeting, referred to Xi Jinping as a dictator. In his statement, he said, "Chinese president Xi Jinping is a guy who is determined to become the most powerful president in history ... and he's getting there, according to the likes of Putin and others."</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Biden's comments were a reaction to Xi Jinping's expanding influence and power consolidation in the Chinese Communist Party. In 2018, the Chinese Communist Party abolished the Presidential term limit, allowing Xi Jinping to rule indefinitely. Since then, Xi Jinping has moved to strengthen his grip on China's economic, political, and social policies. This has led to China's increasing crackdown on dissent, curbing of civil society, and persecution of minority groups.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>China's reaction to Biden's statement</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Soon after Biden's comment, China hit back, calling it a ‘slanderous' and ‘malicious attack.' China's foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, said in his statement, "We hope the United States can respect the facts, stop smearing the Communist Party of China and China's political system, and stop interfering in China's internal affairs."</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Chinese media outlets also criticised Biden's remarks. The Global Times, a state-run media outlet, ran an editorial, warning the US not to "underestimate China's determination to defend its sovereignty, security and development interest."</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Implications on US-China relations</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>US-China relations have been at an all-time low for the past few years. Issues such as trade, human rights, and territorial disputes in the South China Sea have fuelled tensions between the two superpowers. Biden's comment on Xi Jinping further strains the already complicated relationship.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>China has become increasingly assertive in the Indo-Pacific region, and US allies have called on Biden to take a firmer stance against China's actions. It remains to be seen how China will react should Biden follow through with his promises of a strong diplomatic approach towards Beijing.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The impact of US-China relations extends beyond economic and political realms. The recent conflicts have already triggered a geopolitical shift in the Indo-Pacific region. Increased tensions may lead to new alliances being formed, or existing ones being strengthened, in the region.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case studies on US-China relations</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The ongoing conflict between the US and China has had far-reaching effects. Some noteworthy cases are discussed below.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Trade war</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The US-China trade war began in 2018 when Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese imports. The move was a reaction to China's alleged unfair trade practices, including intellectual property theft and technology transfers.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Both countries continued to impose tariffs on each other, leading to a significant decrease in global trade. The International Monetary Fund estimated that the trade-war could cost the global economy up to $700 billion.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Territorial disputes in the South China Sea</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The South China Sea is home to several shipping lanes, and trillions of dollars worth of goods pass through the region annually. China claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea, and has built military bases on artificial islands in the region. The US has frequently conducted freedom of navigation operations in the region, leading to tensions with China.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>These disputes have implications beyond the region as the US has pledged to continue to protect freedom of navigation in the region. It also highlights the importance of international law in resolving such conflicts.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, Biden's comment on Xi Jinping has the potential to exacerbate tensions between the US and China. US-China relations have far-reaching implications and may impact other nations beyond these two superpowers. In light of the above, the following are the three points that other countries should expect from both countries:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1) Scrutiny on China's internal affairs: China's crackdown on human rights and civil society may come under increased scrutiny from international observers.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2) Increased focus on US-China relations: The US-China trade war and territorial disputes in the South China Sea will continue to be important diplomatic issues.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3) New alliances in the Indo-Pacific region: Increased tensions between the two countries may lead to the formation of new regional alliances.</p>
