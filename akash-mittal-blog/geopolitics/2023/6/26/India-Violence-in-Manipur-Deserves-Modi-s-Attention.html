    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>It was a normal day in Imphal, the capital city of Manipur, a northeastern state in India. Ram was going to his workplace when he saw a group of people protesting against the government. He didn't pay much attention to it and continued on his way. But suddenly, he heard gunshots and people started running in panic. Ram was also taken aback and started running for his life. He managed to take shelter in a nearby shop, which was also filled with scared people, waiting for the violence to subside.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>Violence in Manipur is not a rare occurrence. The state has been reeling under the shadow of insurgency for many years. Bomb blasts, shootings, kidnappings, and extortions are some of the common incidents that happen almost on a daily basis. The violence has not only affected the people of Manipur but also the neighboring states, as many of the extremist groups operate from across the border.</p>
    <p>The government has tried to tackle the problem through various measures, such as deploying more security forces, initiating peace talks with the insurgent groups, and implementing development projects. However, none of the efforts have been able to bring lasting peace to the state.</p>
    <p>The people of Manipur have also suffered due to the violence. Many have lost their lives, their homes, and their livelihoods. Women are particularly vulnerable to the violence, as they are often targeted for rape and other forms of abuse. Children have also been affected, as they are unable to attend schools regularly due to the frequent bandhs and curfews.</p>

    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>One of the worst incidents of violence in Manipur was the 2015 massacre of 18 army personnel by the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Khaplang). The incident had a huge impact on the morale of the security forces, who felt betrayed by the ceasefire agreement they had signed with the group. Many of the soldiers were young and had joined the army to serve their country, but were killed mercilessly in the line of duty.</p>
    <p>Another case is that of Irom Sharmila, a civil rights activist who went on a hunger strike for 16 years to protest against the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, which gives sweeping powers to the security forces to deal with insurgency. She was force-fed by the government for all those years and was finally released in 2016, but her struggle did little to change the situation on the ground.</p>
    <p>Yet another case is that of the border trade between India and Myanmar, which was started in 1995 to boost the economy of the region. However, the trade has suffered due to the frequent disruptions caused by the extremist groups. The traders have to pay hefty bribes to the groups to pass through the border, which has led to an increase in the prices of the goods and has also affected the quality of the products.</p>

   <section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>The government needs to take a more proactive role in resolving the issue of violence in Manipur. It should initiate dialogue with all the stakeholders, including the civil society organizations, the tribal leaders, and the insurgent groups. It should also encourage the participation of women in the peace process, as they are the ones who suffer the most.</li>
     <li>Security forces should adopt a more humane approach while dealing with the people of Manipur. They should be trained to respect human rights and should be held accountable for any excesses they commit. The government should also review the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act and consider its repeal, as it has been criticized by human rights organizations for giving arbitrary powers to the security forces.</li>
     <li>The infrastructure of Manipur should be improved to create more employment opportunities and to provide better education and healthcare facilities. This would not only address the grievances of the people but would also make them less vulnerable to the extremist propaganda.</li>
