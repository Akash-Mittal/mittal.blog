   <p>On November 26, 2008, Mumbai, India was hit by one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in its history. A group of 10 terrorists from Pakistan entered the city and carried out a series of coordinated shootings and bombings that lasted for four days. The attack resulted in the deaths of 166 people and injured over 300. The world condemned the attack and supported India in its pursuit of justice.</p>
   <p>India has been seeking international support to declare Masood Azhar, the founder and leader of Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed, as a global terrorist. Azhar is responsible for several terrorist attacks in India, including the 2019 Pulwama attack which killed 40 Indian soldiers.</p>
   <p>However, China has repeatedly blocked India's efforts at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to designate Azhar as a global terrorist.</p>
   <p>Recently, China again blocked a resolution introduced by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to blacklist Azhar and subject him to a global travel ban, asset freeze, and arms embargo. China's move prompted strong criticism from India.</p>
   <h2>Examples of China's Interference in India's Fight against Terrorism</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>In 2016, China vetoed India's bid to join the Nuclear Suppliers Group, which India believed would help prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. China's move was seen as an attempt to strengthen its ally Pakistan.</li>
    <li>In 2017, China again blocked India's move at the UNSC to designate Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist.</li>
    <li>In 2018, China opposed India's proposal to declare Jaish-e-Mohammed as a terrorist organization at the UNSC and called for "more evidence" against it.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Case Studies of China's Support for Pakistan's Terrorism</h2>
   <p>Pakistan has been accused by India and the international community of supporting terrorism. China, meanwhile, has been extending its support to Pakistan, politically and economically.</p>
   <p>China has invested heavily in Pakistan's infrastructure projects, including the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. India has opposed the CPEC as it violates its sovereignty and integrity.</p>
   <p>China has also been providing military assistance to Pakistan, including the supply of fighter jets and submarines. Pakistan has been using this military assistance against India.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>India's fight against terrorism has been hindered by China's interference at international forums. China's support for Pakistan's terrorism and its refusal to designate terrorists like Masood Azhar as global terrorists is a cause of concern for India and the international community. India needs to work with like-minded countries to put pressure on China to change its stance and support India's fight against terrorism.</p>
   <ol>
    <li>China's support for Pakistan's terrorism is a threat to regional and international security.</li>
    <li>China needs to be held accountable for its actions and must change its stance on terrorism.</li>
    <li>India needs to work with its partners to counter China's interference in its fight against terrorism.</li>
   </ol>
