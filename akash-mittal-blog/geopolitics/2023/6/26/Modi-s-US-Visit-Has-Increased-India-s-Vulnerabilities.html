   <p>During PM Modi's visit to the United States in 2019, he was welcomed by President Donald Trump with a grand reception at the NRG Stadium in Houston. The entire event was televised worldwide, and Indians across the globe watched with pride. However, in the excitement and glamour of the moment, we fail to realize that such a high-profile event leaves India vulnerable to a plethora of security threats. The very essence of that event underscores the relevance of the topic of discussion â€“ Modi's US Visit Has Increased India's Vulnerabilities.</p>
   <h2>Examples</h2>
   <p>PM Modi's US visit is usually a grand event that involves meetings with various US officials, businessmen, and representatives. While the visit is meant to strengthen the bilateral relationship between the two countries, it also highlights the importance of India in the global economy and geopolitical arena. However, this visit also leaves India open to a variety of vulnerabilities, including:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Physical Security Threats:</strong> Whenever a high-profile individual visits a foreign country, it increases the risk of physical attacks. In the case of PM Modi's US visit, the security arrangements are always on high alert. However, even with such precautions, there are still risks of attacks from terrorists, extremists, or even individual assailants.</li>
    <li><strong>Cybersecurity Threats:</strong> In today's digital age, cybersecurity threats are a major concern for everyone, including nations. While India has a robust cybersecurity system, the US is one of the leading countries in terms of cybersecurity technology. During PM Modi's US visit, there is always a risk of cyber attacks against Indian institutions and infrastructure, as well as theft of sensitive intellectual property and data.</li>
    <li><strong>Diplomatic Vulnerabilities:</strong> When PM Modi meets with US officials, representatives, and businessmen, there are always discussions about bilateral trade, investment, and other strategic issues. However, these discussions can also leave India open to diplomatic vulnerabilities, such as being coerced into making concessions or being forced into unfavorable deals.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <p>The risks of high-profile visits are well-known. Over the years, there have been several examples of incidents that have occurred during such visits:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Physical Security Threats:</strong> The 2015 Paris Attacks - French President Francois Hollande was attending a football match in Paris when multiple coordinated terrorist attacks occurred, killing several people, including one of the president's bodyguards.</li>
    <li><strong>Cybersecurity Threats:</strong> The 2014 Cyberattack on Sony Pictures - North Korean hackers attacked Sony Pictures in response to the release of the film "The Interview," which portrayed the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.</li>
    <li><strong>Diplomatic Vulnerabilities:</strong> The 2005 Visit of Hu Jintao to the United States - During a state visit of the Chinese President to the US, the Chinese government coerced the US government into blocking a Falun Gong demonstration, despite the First Amendment rights of the protesters.</li>
   </ul>
