   <p>Once upon a time there were two neighboring countries named China and India. They shared a long border and had cultural and economic ties for centuries. However, in recent years, the geopolitical landscape in the region has changed, with the rise of China as a global power and the growing influence of the US. India, on the other hand, has been seeking to establish itself as a regional power and has been forging closer ties with the US. In this context, China has been urging India not to align itself with the US and abandon joining its "selfish game".</p>

   <h2>Examples of China's Concerns</h2>
   <p>China has been critical of India's growing strategic partnership with the US, especially in the areas of defense, trade, and technology. China sees this as a threat to its own regional dominance and has been pushing back against India's moves. For instance, China has been opposing India's entry into the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), a key nuclear trade body, as it fears that India's nuclear ambitions may pose a security threat to China's interests. Similarly, China has been blocking India's membership of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), a decision-making body that China is a permanent member of, citing India's lack of credentials. China has also been wary of India's participation in the Quad, a regional grouping that aims to counter China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <p>One of the recent examples of China's concerns over India's alignment with the US was during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's first state visit to the US in September 2021. China asked India to "shun the US' selfish game" and "avoid a zero-sum game mentality" while engaging with the US. China's concern was that India's close ties with the US may lead to a new Cold War in the region and undermine the stability and development of the two countries. India, however, has maintained that its relationship with the US is based on shared values and interests and is not targeted against any third country.</p>
