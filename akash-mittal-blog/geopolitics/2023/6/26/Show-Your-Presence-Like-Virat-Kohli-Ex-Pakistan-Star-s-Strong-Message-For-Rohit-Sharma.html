    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma are two of the most talented cricketers in the world. While Kohli is known for his aggressive captaincy and leadership skills, Rohit is known for his calm demeanor and his ability to lead from the front. However, former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali believes that Rohit can learn a thing or two from Kohli when it comes to leadership.</p>
    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>In a recent interview, Basit Ali said that Rohit needs to show his presence on the field like Kohli does. He believes that Kohli's aggressive body language and the way he commands the team is what sets him apart as a leader. Basit feels that Rohit, who is the vice-captain of the Indian team, needs to be more assertive and lead by example.</p><!-- Add examples -->
