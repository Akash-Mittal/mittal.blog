   <p>In a recent turn of events, two Indian journalists were asked to leave China by its authorities. According to the Chinese government, the Indian journalists were allegedly ‘unfairly treating' Chinese reporters and causing inconvenience to them. The two Indian journalists were working for two leading Indian newspapers, and their expulsion has sparked outrage and concern among the Indian media fraternity.</p>
   <p>However, this incident is not an isolated one. Over the past years, several journalists have been expelled from China, and many others have faced harassment and intimidation.</p>
   <h2>Examples</h2>
   <p>One such example was the expulsion of Megha Rajagopalan, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who was forced to leave China in 2020. Megha was reporting on the treatment of China's Uighur Muslims when she was asked to leave the country by its authorities. Similarly, in 2019, Australian journalist Cheng Lei was detained in China for alleged ‘endangering national security' and was only recently allowed to return to Australia.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <h3>The Case of Zhang Zhan</h3>
   <p>Zhang Zhan, a citizen journalist, was arrested in 2020 for reporting on the Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China. She was accused of spreading false information and ‘picking quarrels and provoking trouble'. Despite facing poor health and mistreatment in detention, Zhang was sentenced to four years in prison in December 2020.</p>
   <h3>The Case of Gao Yu</h3>
   <p>Gao Yu, a veteran Chinese journalist, was detained in 2014 for ‘leaking state secrets' and was sentenced to seven years in prison. Gao's case was widely criticized by the international community, and several media organizations and human rights groups campaigned for her release. In November 2015, Gao was released on medical parole after serving more than two years of her sentence.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>The expulsion of two Indian journalists from China is a matter of concern, and it highlights the need for more transparency and freedom of press in China.</li>
    <li>The cases of Megha Rajagopalan, Cheng Lei, Zhang Zhan, and Gao Yu show the challenges that journalists face in reporting from China, and the need for greater protection of press freedom and human rights.</li>
    <li>The international community must come together to condemn the Chinese government's actions and press for greater accountability and respect for human rights.</li>
