  <p>It was a fierce match between India and Pakistan during the SAFF Cup, and tensions were high. The crowd was electric, there were thunderous cheers and jeers, and the players on the field were giving it their all. Then, suddenly, there was a scuffle between players from both teams. It was in that moment that Igor Stimac, the Croatian head coach of the Indian football team, showed his passion and aggression.</p><!-- Examples of his Aggression -->

It all depends on how it is managed by the player or coach.</p>
