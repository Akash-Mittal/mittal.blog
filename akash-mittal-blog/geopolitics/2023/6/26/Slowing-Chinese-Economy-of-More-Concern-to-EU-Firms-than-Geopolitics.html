    <p>Once upon a time, there was a European firm that wanted to expand its business globally. The firm had its eye on China, which offered huge market potential and a vast pool of talent. The firm invested heavily in its Chinese operations and hired local talent to lead the way.</p>
    <p>However, as the years went by, the global economy started to slow down, and China was no exception. The Chinese economy faced headwinds from the trade war with the US and rising debt levels. Slowly but surely, the firm's Chinese operations started to see a decline in profitability.</p>
    <p>Despite the geopolitical tensions between China and the EU, the firm realized that the slowing Chinese economy was a more pressing concern. It had to reassess its strategy and find ways to navigate the challenges posed by the Chinese market.</p>
