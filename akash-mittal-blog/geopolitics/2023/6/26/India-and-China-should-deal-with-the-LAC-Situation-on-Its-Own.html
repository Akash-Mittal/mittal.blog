  <p>It was a bright summer day in June 2020, when the Indian Army was ambushed by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) of China in the Galwan Valley, Ladakh. The skirmish led to the death of 20 Indian soldiers. The Indian side lost some brave men who had courageously served their country. The situation at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) has since been tense, and both India and China have held several rounds of talks to resolve the issue peacefully.</p>
  <h2>Why India and China should deal with the LAC situation on their own?</h2>
  <p>The India-China border dispute is one of the longest-running conflicts in the world. The two countries share a 3,488 km long border, and most of it remains unresolved. Both India and China have differing perceptions of the LAC, which has been the primary cause of the conflict. The recent escalation in tensions between the two countries has led to calls for international intervention in the issue. However, it is imperative that India and China deal with the LAC situation on their own.</p>
  <h2>Examples of conflicts that were resolved on their own</h2>
  <p>History has shown that countries that resolved their internal conflicts on their own have had a more sustained peace as compared to conflicts that were resolved by external forces. For instance, the Indo-Pak war of 1971 and the subsequent creation of Bangladesh was resolved bilaterally between India and Pakistan. The conflict in Northern Ireland was resolved through negotiations between the British and Irish governments.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, conflicts that were resolved through international intervention have not always been successful. The US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 is an example of how external intervention can destabilize a country and create more conflicts. The ongoing conflict in Syria is another example of how international intervention has failed to resolve the issue.</p>
  <h2>Case studies of conflicts that were resolved bilaterally</h2>
  <p>India and China have had several rounds of talks to resolve the LAC issue. Diplomatic channels have been used to de-escalate the situation, and both sides have made efforts to disengage troops from the LAC. The historical boundary dispute has been a thorn in the relationship between the two countries for over seven decades. However, India and China have successfully resolved several issues, including the Chumar and Doklam standoffs, through bilateral engagement.</p>
  <p>The India-Pakistan peace process is another example of how bilateral engagement can help resolve conflicts. In 2001, both countries agreed on a ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir. The ceasefire has since been in place, and both countries are constantly engaged in talks to resolve the issue.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The India-China LAC issue is a complex problem that requires a long-term solution. Although international intervention may seem like a quick fix, it is not a sustainable solution for the conflict. India and China need to engage in bilateral talks and find a peaceful resolution to the issue. However, this will require both countries to show restraint, transparency, and a willingness to compromise. The two countries need to take ownership of the problem and deal with it on their own.</p>
