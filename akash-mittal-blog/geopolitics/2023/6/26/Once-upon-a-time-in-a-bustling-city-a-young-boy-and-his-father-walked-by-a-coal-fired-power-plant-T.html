  <p></p>
  <p>Fast forward to the present, where China and India are two of the fastest-growing economies in the world. This growth has led to an insatiable demand for energy, particularly in the form of coal. However, this demand is coming at a cost that extends beyond just economic benefits.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>While the usage of coal is falling in the US and EU due to concerns over climate change, the demand from China and India has pushed global coal prices to a record high. It is a paradoxical situation where climate mitigation efforts in developed countries have unintentionally exacerbated the coal dependence of developing countries.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case in point, China has added 200 GW of coal-fired power generation capacity in the past decade, and accounts for half of the world's coal consumption. There are now plans for another 56 GW of capacity to be added, which is equivalent to the entire coal capacity of Germany, the UK, and Spain.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>India, on the other hand, relies on coal for 70% of its electricity generation. Despite its efforts to move towards renewable energy, the country's increasing energy demand means that coal will remain a significant source of energy for the foreseeable future.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This dependence on coal comes at a cost. Air pollution in China and India is infamous, with smog and hazardous particles causing serious health risks. The burning of coal also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating the global climate crisis.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Furthermore, the extraction and transportation of coal also have environmental consequences. The disruption of ecosystems, water pollution, and soil depletion are just some of the impacts associated with coal mining.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Despite these concerns, the demand for coal remains high, particularly in China and India. While renewable energy sources are making strides, they cannot meet the demand at the same pace as coal.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, the paradoxical situation of falling coal usage in developed countries and rising coal consumption in developing countries highlights the need for a more comprehensive approach to energy transition. The following three points should be considered:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>- A global effort to transition away from coal and toward renewable energy sources is needed to mitigate the increasing risks of climate change and environmental degradation.</p>
  <p>- Developing countries need more support to transition to renewable energy and must be included in international efforts to mitigate climate change.</p>
  <p>- Companies should be encouraged to adopt sustainable energy practices that are considerate of environmental, social, and economic factors.</p>
