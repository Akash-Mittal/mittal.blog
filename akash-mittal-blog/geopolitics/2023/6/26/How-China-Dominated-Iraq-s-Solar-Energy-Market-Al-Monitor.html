  <p>The sun was shining brightly in the Baghdad sky. The streets of the city were bustling with people going about their daily business. A group of engineers from China were visiting Iraq to explore opportunities in the solar energy sector. They met with local officials and businessmen and after a few months, they were able to secure contracts to install solar energy projects across the country.</p>
  <p>Today, China dominates Iraq's solar energy market. Chinese companies have completed more than 70% of the country's solar energy projects. They have the expertise, technology, and financial resources to carry out large-scale projects, and they are willing to work closely with the Iraqi government to ensure the success of their ventures.</p>
  <h2>Examples of China's Dominance in Iraq's Solar Energy Market</h2>
  <p>One of the most significant solar energy projects in Iraq is the 50 MW Karbala Solar Power Plant, which was completed by a Chinese company in 2020. The plant is capable of producing electricity for more than 30,000 households and will reduce Iraq's carbon emissions by 25,000 tonnes per year. This project was funded by the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).</p>
  <p>Another example is the 300 MW Al-Dhuluiya Solar Power Plant, which was completed by a Chinese company in 2019. The plant covers an area of 4.5 square kilometers and is capable of producing electricity for more than 100,000 households. The project was funded by the Chinese government and the China Development Bank.</p>
  <h2>Case Study: Chinese Companies in Iraq's Solar Energy Market</h2>
  <p>China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) is one of the major players in Iraq's solar energy market. The company has completed multiple projects across the country, including the Karbala and Al-Dhuluiya projects. They also have plans to build a 1 GW solar power plant in Iraq's southern desert region, which would be one of the largest solar energy projects in the world.</p>
  <p>Another Chinese company, TBEA Xinjiang SunOasis, has also made significant strides in Iraq's solar energy market. The company completed the 50 MW Zhibo Solar Power Plant in 2018, which is capable of producing electricity for more than 30,000 households. They are also working on a 300 MW solar power project in Iraq's Al-Sadr City, which is expected to be completed in 2022.</p>
