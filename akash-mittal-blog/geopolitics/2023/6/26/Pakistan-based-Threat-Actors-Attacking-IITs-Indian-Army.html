    <p>It was a regular day at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi. But soon the students and faculty members were in for a shock as they found out that their systems had been hacked by Pakistani cyber criminals. This was not just a one-time attack but a series of attacks by Pakistan-based threat actors on IITs and the Indian Army.</p>
    <h2>Modus Operandi</h2>
    <p>The hackers from Pakistan use several methods to carry out their attacks. They use social engineering to trick employees into clicking on malicious links or downloading infected files. They also use spear-phishing, which involves creating fake emails that appear to be from a trusted source to trick individuals into giving away private information.</p>
    <p>Moreover, they use malware such as keyloggers, which record keystrokes and steal sensitive information like passwords and credit card numbers. They also use ransomware, which takes control of a victim's computer and demands payment to release the files or system. These methods work best on those organizations that have weak cybersecurity protocols.</p>
    <h2>Motive</h2>
    <p>The motive behind the attacks is to disrupt the Indian economy and government operations. These attacks also allow the hackers to steal sensitive information such as trade secrets and national security information. The hackers want to weaken India's defense and economic capabilities so that they can gain the upper hand in any potential conflict.</p>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>One of the most recent examples of such a cyber attack is the hacking of an Indian Army officer's computer by Pakistan-based threat actors. The officers' computer contained vital information related to India's defense. The hackers were able to steal sensitive information by hacking into the computer through a fake email.</p>
    <p>In another incident, Pakistani hackers used spear-phishing to hack into the systems of the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), a government-run organization that works on high-performance computing.</p>
    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>One notable case of a successful cyber attack is the Stuxnet virus. In 2010, the virus was discovered infecting Iranian nuclear facilities' computers. The virus was created by the United States and Israel and was designed to damage Iran's nuclear weapons program.</p>
    <p>In 2016, Pakistani hackers compromised the official website of the Indian Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan. The website was used to distribute propaganda and anti-India messages. The hackers used SQL injection attacks to compromise the website.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, Pakistan-based threat actors pose a significant threat to India's cybersecurity. Their attacks are sophisticated and can cause significant damage to the Indian economy and government operations. It is essential to have robust cybersecurity protocols in place to prevent these attacks from causing damage.</p>
    <ol>
     <li>India needs to strengthen its cybersecurity and ensure that all organizations have robust protocols in place.</li>
     <li>Employees should undergo regular training to identify potential threats and report to IT support.</li>
     <li>Regular cybersecurity audits must be conducted to ensure that all systems are up-to-date and secure.</li>
