  <h1>How China's Rise Could Affect Russia</h1></br> <img src="images/How-China-s-Rise-Could-Affect-Russia.jpeg" alt="+How-China-s-Rise-Could-Affect-Russia+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/world/2023/06/26/china-contends-with-weakened-putin-after-wagner-mutiny.html" target="_blank" href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/world/2023/06/26/china-contends-with-weakened-putin-after-wagner-mutiny.html" rel="noopener">https://www.thejakartapost.com/world/2023/06/26/china-contends-with-weakened-putin-after-wagner-mutiny.html</a></span></h5>
  <p>Lena was a successful businesswoman working in a fast-paced corporate world. She was known for her hefty investments in the stock market and played with millions of dollars to make profits. However, Lena had one asset that she always underestimated, her neighbor who lived in a modest apartment and owned a grocery store. Once, Lena bought a stock that she believed would double her profits, but the company failed to deliver, and Lena lost all of her investments. Meanwhile, Lena's neighbor flourished by investing in small yet consistent ventures. Lena realized that bigger doesn't mean better and learned the importance of diversifying her portfolio.</p>
  <p>The same argument can be made for geopolitical powers like Russia and China. Russia has been a global superpower during the Cold War, but its economy started to decline after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. While Russia struggled to revive its economic and political influence, China's rise has been exponential. China is now the second-largest economy in the world and has the world's largest army.</p>
  <p>It's crucial to understand how China's rise could affect Russia's geopolitical power and whether it's time for Russia to diversify its foreign policy portfolio.</p>
  <h2>Russia's Dependence on China</h2>
  <p>Russia and China share a unique relationship that has brought them closer in recent years. Their partnership is primarily driven by a shared opposition to American global dominance and support for an alternative world order, which includes multipolarity and a more prominent role for non-Western countries.</p>
  <p>One example of this partnership is the Eastern Economic Forum, which was established in 2015. The forum aims to strengthen economic ties between the two countries and is seen as a counterweight to the Western-led World Economic Forum.</p>
  <p>The countries have signed bilateral agreements, and China remains Russia's top trading partner. However, this partnership has caused some concerns among Russian elites who fear China's long-term intentions. For instance, some experts believe that China's Belt and Road Initiative, a massive infrastructure project that aims to connect China with over 70 countries across Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Middle East, could further strengthen China's geopolitical power and undermine Russia's.</p>
  <h2>The Wagner Mutiny and Putin's Weakened Position</h2>
  <p>In February 2018, a group of Russian mercenaries, known as the Wagner Group, was attacked by American forces in Syria. The attack resulted in massive losses for the Wagner Group, and the incident went unnoticed by the Russian media. Experts suggest that the Wagner Group was initially created by Putin's ally, Yevgeny Prigozhin, to provide security for the oil and gas fields in Syria. However, the group became increasingly involved in combat operations, which is illegal under international law. Since then, the Wagner Group has been used to fight in Ukraine, Libya, and the Central African Republic.</p>
  <p>In 2019, the Wagner Group attempted a mutiny against Putin, which created a rift between Putin and Prigozhin. The failure of the mutiny is believed to have weakened Putin's position, and as a result, Russia's foreign policy has shifted to accommodate China's interest.</p>
  <h2>Case Study: The Arctic Region</h2>
  <p>The Arctic region is one of the most critical areas for Russia's geopolitical power. The region is rich in natural resources like oil, gas, and rare-earth metals. Russia has been investing heavily in infrastructure and military capabilities to secure its interests in the region. However, China's increasing interest in the Arctic has added a new dimension to the region's politics.</p>
  <p>China's Belt and Road Initiative includes the Polar Silk Road, which aims to connect China with Europe via the Northern Sea Route. The route cuts the travel time between China and Europe by almost 20%. Additionally, China has been investing in Arctic infrastructure projects, including a satellite ground station and a research station. Russia provides China with access to its icebreaker fleet, which is crucial for China's interests in the Arctic.</p>
  <p>However, some experts believe that China's investment in the Arctic could threaten Russia's geopolitical power in the region. Russia's dependence on China's investment could limit its options and potentially undermine its power in the region.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>China's rise has brought new challenges and opportunities for Russia. While China remains Russia's top trading partner, its long-term intentions and increasing geopolitical power could undermine Russia's position. Russia needs to diversify its foreign policy portfolio and take advantage of emerging opportunities.</p>
  <p>The case study of the Arctic region highlights the challenges Russia faces from China's rise. Russia needs to balance its dependence on China's investments in the region and secure its geopolitical power in the area.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, the geopolitical landscape is changing, and old alliances have become less relevant. Countries like Russia need to re-evaluate their foreign policy strategy and prepare for a new world order.</p>
