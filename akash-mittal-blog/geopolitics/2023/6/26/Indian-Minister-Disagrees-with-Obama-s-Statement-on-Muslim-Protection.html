     <h2>The Story</h2>
     <p>Recently, former US President Barack Obama tweeted about the importance of protecting the rights of Muslim Americans. "Muslim Americans are our friends and our neighbors; they serve in our government, they fought for our country. We cannot allow voices of hatred to divide us and threaten the fabric of our democracy." However, Indian Minister for Minority Affairs, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, scoffed at Obama's statement, saying that the government in India has always protected the rights and interests of Muslims and other minorities.</p>

     <h2>Examples</h2>
     <p>Naqvi pointed out that Muslims have been given the freedom to practice their religion in India, citing the example of the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, which the Indian government facilitates for thousands of Indian Muslims each year. He mentioned that Muslims are also given the right to vote, to run for public office, and to participate in all economic and social activities without any discrimination. Naqvi also noted that India has one of the largest Muslim populations in the world, and they are an integral part of the country's fabric.</p>

     <h2>Case Studies</h2>
     <p>Naqvi also provided some case studies to back up his claim. He spoke about the government's decision to fund the education of a young Muslim girl from a poor family in Uttar Pradesh, stating that such initiatives show that the government is committed to the welfare of all citizens. Naqvi also highlighted the role of Muslims in national security, pointing to the fact that around 200 Muslims were recruited into the Indian army in 2020.</p>

     <h2>Conclusion</h2>
     <p>Naqvi's response to Obama's statement shows that there are different perspectives on the issue of protecting Muslims. While Obama's focus was on the US, Naqvi highlighted India's efforts to ensure the rights and welfare of its Muslim population. Here are three key takeaways from the debate:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>Protection of Muslim rights is a global issue that requires attention and action from governments and communities worldwide.</li>
      <li>It is important to recognize and appreciate the efforts of governments that have taken steps to protect the rights and welfare of their Muslim citizens and other minorities.</li>
      <li>There is still much work to be done in achieving true equality for Muslims and other marginalized groups worldwide.</li>
     </ol>
