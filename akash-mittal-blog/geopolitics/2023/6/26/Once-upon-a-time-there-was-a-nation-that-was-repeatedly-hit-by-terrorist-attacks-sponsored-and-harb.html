  <p>Over the years, India has been the victim of several terrorist attacks, with the most disturbing being the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks. The attacks were orchestrated by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and carried out by the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist group. The attacks left over 166 people dead and several injured. The international community condemned the attacks, and India sought justice for the victims. However, Pakistan, the country responsible for these attacks, continued to harbour terrorists, until recently when India presented concrete evidence at the United Nations (UN).</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>India's presentation at the UN Security Council came after China blocked its bid to blacklist Masood Azhar, the leader of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), responsible for several terrorist attacks in India, including the Pulwama terror attack. China vetoed India's proposal for the fourth time, protecting Azhar from being listed as a global terrorist. However, India did not give up and presented evidence of Pakistan's terror links and sponsored terrorism at the UN.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>India's presentation included a dossier containing evidence of Pakistan's involvement in terror activities. The dossier contained details of Pakistan's support to terrorist groups like LeT and JeM, including their training camps and funding sources. India also presented transcripts of conversations between the terrorists involved in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks and their handlers sitting in Pakistan. The evidence conclusively proved Pakistan's hand in the attacks and its continued support to terrorist organizations.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>India's struggle against Pakistan-sponsored terrorism is not new. Over the years, India has faced several terrorist attacks, which were sponsored by Pakistan. For instance, the Parliament Attack of 2001, Mumbai train bombings of 2006, Pathankot Air Force base attack of 2016, and the Uri attack of 2016, to name a few. In each of these attacks, Pakistan was found to be the mastermind, providing logistical support, funding and training to the terrorists. The attacks were aimed at destabilizing India and creating chaos in the country.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The evidence presented by India at the UN, with the help of its allies, including the US, UK and France, was a significant blow to Pakistan. The international community, which has long turned a blind eye to Pakistan's terror links, cannot ignore the evidence anymore. The expos√© has put Pakistan on the backfoot, exposing its true intentions and its role as a sponsor of terrorism. The international community must take strict action against Pakistan, including imposing sanctions, to ensure that it does not continue to harbour terrorists.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, India's struggle against Pakistan-sponsored terrorism has been a long and difficult one. Its efforts to expose the true face of terrorism and the nations that support it were finally recognized at the international level with the presentation of concrete evidence at the UN. The evidence conclusively proved Pakistan's role as a sponsor of terrorism and is a significant blow to the country. However, India's struggle is far from over, and the international community must take strict action against Pakistan to prevent it from continuing to harbour terrorists.</p>
