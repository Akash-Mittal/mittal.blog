    <p>Do you know why cyclones used to be named after women? It's because in the early 1900s, an Australian weather forecaster named Clement Wragge started using women's names based on his experience with the tempestuous moods of his former girlfriend.</p>
    <p>However, this naming convention was later criticized for being sexist and insensitive, especially since it perpetuated the stereotype of women being unpredictable and dangerous.</p>

    <h2>Examples of Cyclone Names</h2>
    <p>Nowadays, a different naming system is used for cyclones that affect different regions around the world. In the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific, names are selected from a list that alternates between male and female names. In the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean, names are assigned by the national meteorological agencies of the countries that are affected.</p>
    <p>For example, some recent cyclone names that have been used in India include:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Fani</li>
     <li>Kyarr</li>
     <li>Maha</li>
     <li>Nisarga</li>
     <li>Yaas</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>Having a naming system for cyclones can help raise public awareness and reduce confusion, especially when multiple storms are occurring simultaneously or in close succession.</p>
    <p>A good example of this is the 2005 hurricane season in the Atlantic, which was one of the busiest seasons on record. With a total of 28 named storms, including Hurricane Katrina which devastated New Orleans, it would have been difficult to keep track of each storm's progress and impact without a naming system.</p>
    <p>Another case study is the 2020 super cyclone Amphan, which hit India and Bangladesh causing widespread damage and loss of life. By giving the cyclone a name, it was easier for the public and authorities to follow its path and take necessary precautions.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Having a naming system for cyclones is important for several reasons:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>It helps raise public awareness and reduce confusion.</li>
     <li>It makes it easier for authorities to track the path of storms and take necessary precautions.</li>
     <li>It ensures that storms are not named in a way that is insensitive or offensive to any group of people.</li>
    </ol>
