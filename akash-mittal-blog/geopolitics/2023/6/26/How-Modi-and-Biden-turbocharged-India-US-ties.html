   <h2>An interesting story</h2>
   <p>On September 24, 2014, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi landed at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington DC for his first visit to the United States since taking office earlier that year. The mood was high, as Modi was a popular leader and President Barack Obama was eager to build closer ties with India. In a joint statement, Modi and Obama vowed to take the relationship to a new level, calling it a "defining partnership of the 21st century". However, their efforts were met with some obstacles in the following years, with issues such as trade restrictions, defense deals, and climate change stalling progress.</p>
   <h2>Examples of enhanced cooperation</h2>
   <p>Fast forward to the present, and the situation has changed dramatically. The election of Joe Biden as US President in 2020 has brought new opportunities for India-US ties, and Modi and Biden have shown a strong commitment to strengthening the relationship. Some of the areas of cooperation that have seen progress include:</p>
   <h3>Trade and investment</h3>
   <p>The two countries have set an ambitious target of reaching a $500 billion bilateral trade volume, up from the current level of around $150 billion. To achieve this, they have launched initiatives such as the US-India Trade Policy Forum and the Strategic Energy Partnership, as well as concluded a number of agreements and MoUs covering specific sectors. For example, in September 2021, India and the US signed a landmark defense pact that allows for greater cooperation in areas such as regional security, technology transfer, and joint production.</p>
   <h3>Defense and security</h3>
   <p>India and the US have deepened their defense ties in recent years, with the US becoming India's second-largest arms supplier after Russia. The two countries have conducted joint military exercises and signed several defense agreements, including the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) and the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA). In 2021, they formed a Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) comprising Australia and Japan to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific region, seen as a counterweight to China's influence in the region.</p>
   <h3>Technology and healthcare</h3>
   <p>India and the US have also increased cooperation in areas such as space exploration, cybersecurity, and healthcare. The US has supported India's mission to become a leading space power, with NASA collaborating with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on several projects, including the Mars Orbiter Mission. In addition, the two countries are partnering in the fight against Covid-19, with the US providing medical assistance and vaccines to India during the second wave of the pandemic.</p>
   <h2>Case studies of successful partnerships</h2>
   <p>The enhanced cooperation between India and the US has already yielded some fruitful outcomes. Here are a few examples:</p>
   <h3>Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)</h3>
   <p>TCS, one of India's largest IT services firms, has been operating in the US for over 40 years and is now a major employer in the country. In 2019, TCS announced plans to hire an additional 18,000 employees in the US by 2022 as part of its commitment to "localization". The company has also been involved in several community initiatives, such as the "goIT" program that teaches school students about programming and technology. TCS's success in the US market has been helped by its close ties with American companies and universities, such as Johns Hopkins University with whom it collaborates on healthcare innovation.</p>
   <h3>Gilead Sciences</h3>
   <p>Gilead Sciences, a US-based pharmaceutical company, has been working closely with Indian partners to improve access to life-saving medicines in the country. In 2014, Gilead launched a licensing agreement with seven Indian generic drug makers to produce and sell its hepatitis C drug Sovaldi at a lower cost. This initiative has helped to bring down the prices of the drug and make it more widely available to patients in India. In addition, Gilead has partnered with BMS College of Engineering in Bengaluru to establish a laboratory that focuses on biotechnology research and innovation.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion in 3 points</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>The partnership between India and the US has grown stronger under the leadership of Narendra Modi and Joe Biden, with renewed focus on trade, defense, technology, and healthcare.</li>
    <li>The two countries have formed successful partnerships in areas such as IT services, pharmaceuticals, and space exploration, leading to mutual benefits and job creation.</li>
    <li>With China's rise and changing dynamics in the global order, India and the US have the opportunity to become key allies in the Indo-Pacific and beyond, if they continue to work together and build trust and goodwill.</li>
   </ol>
