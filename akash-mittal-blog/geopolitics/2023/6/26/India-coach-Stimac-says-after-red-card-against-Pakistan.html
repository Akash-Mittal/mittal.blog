    <h2>Stimac on his decision to play with 10 men</h2>

    <h2>The Importance of Taking Risks</h2>
    <p>Stimac's decision to play with 10 men could be seen as a risky move, but it paid off. Sometimes, in order to succeed, you have to take risks and be willing to fail. This applies not just in sports, but in life as well. People who are willing to take risks are often the ones who achieve the most success.</p>
    <p>For example, many successful entrepreneurs took big risks to start their companies. Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk all took big risks early on, but their willingness to take those risks paid off and now they are some of the richest people in the world.</p>

    <h2>The Importance of Confidence</h2>
    <p>Stimac's response also shows the importance of confidence in achieving success. As a coach, he needs to have confidence in himself and his team to make bold decisions and take risks. This confidence can also be seen in the players on the field.</p>
    <p>For example, many great athletes are known for their confidence on the field or court. Michael Jordan, Lionel Messi, and Serena Williams are all athletes who have a great deal of confidence in themselves and their abilities. This confidence allows them to perform at their best and achieve great things.</p>
