   <p><i>Once upon a time, in a small village in Pakistan...</i></p>
   <p>Ahmed was a hardworking farmer who cultivated the land passed down from his father. Although he had a meagre income, he was content with his simple life with his wife and children.</p>
   <p>However, in the past few years, things were different. The prices of fertilizers and seeds went up, and the production yield dropped due to environmental changes. His expenses kept rising, and his income decreased, putting him in debt.</p>
   <p>Now, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) demands Pakistan to implement yet another round of austerity measures that might plunge the country into default.</p>

    <h2>What is Happening in Pakistan?</h2>
    <p>Pakistan, similar to many countries hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, has been facing economic hardship, including recessions and inflation. Nevertheless, the country has a long history of seeking loans from the IMF, most recently striving to secure an additional $6 billion in funding.</p><img src="ahmed.jpg" alt="Ahmed holding his crop in the field.">

    <h2>Examples of Impact on Pakistani Citizens</h2>
    <p>As the government seeks to appease the IMF demands through austerity measures, the people of Pakistan are feeling the brunt of the impact. Below are some examples:</p>
    <ol>
     <li><strong>Crippling Inflation</strong></li>
     <p>One example is the cost of sugary items such as sweets and chocolates. According to the Bureau of Statistics, the inflation rate for these items has risen by 21.4% since May 2020. Families trying to make ends meet have been cutting out these 'luxury' items altogether.</p>
     <li><strong>Job Losses</strong></li>
     <p>With each IMF bailout, the government has to cut down public expenditures. As a result, many people, such as government workers and employees of non-profit organizations, have lost their jobs.</p>
     <li><strong>Access to Healthcare</strong></li>
     <p>The government has diverted its limited funds elsewhere, making healthcare less accessible to poor citizens. Many patients who were counting on the government-run hospitals were turned away or faced long waiting times.</p>
    </ol>

    <h2>Case Study: The Education Sector</h2>
    <p>One of the areas greatly impacted by the austerity measures is the education sector. Schools, many of which were underfunded already, have been seeing a vast decrease in their resources and quality. As teachers are being laid off, classroom sizes are increasing, and the establishment of new schools seems more and more unlikely, children's education is being compromised.</p>
    <p>A case in point is the Government Boys Primary School in Mominabad Khiyali, a small village in Rahimyar Khan district. The school, which was supposed to open in September 2018, is still incomplete. The contractors have abandoned the construction due to a lack of promised funds from the government.</p><img src="school.jpg" alt="An unfinished, abandoned school building.">

    <h2>Conclusion: What are the Crucial Issues?</h2>
    <p>As we examine the IMF's demands on Pakistan's economy, we can pinpoint three main issues.</p>
    <ol>
     <li><strong>IMF approval of austerity measures won't fix the problem.</strong> <p>Austerity measures, such as cutting public sector jobs, will hit citizens harder than the policymakers. This will increase the gap between the rich and poor, and keep Pakistan's economy and citizens from thriving.</p></li>
     <li><strong>The root problems need to be addressed.</strong> <p>The IMF must work to support Pakistan's future growth and development with long-term solutions rather than band-aids. Schemes, such as investing in eco-friendly agriculture and supporting entrepreneurship, have more potential for lifting Pakistan out of its financial dire state than rehashing supposed solutions that did not address the fundaental root cause of the problem.</p></li>
     <li><strong>Basic social welfare provisions must be guaranteed to every citizen.</strong> <p>Every Pakistani citizen deserves to have access to quality healthcare, education, and a dignified standard of living. The Pakistani government's leadership should ensure that their policies prioritize the well-being of people over the whims of international institutions like the IMF.</p></li>
