    <p>It was a typical day in Seoul and the sun was shining brightly. Lee, a college student, was walking on the street towards her university. Suddenly, she heard a loud explosion nearby. People were panicking, screaming and running for their lives. Lee didn't know what to do. She just stood frozen on the middle of the sidewalk. A few minutes later, she saw a missile with the North Korean flag on it flying over the city. The missile exploded in the mountains near the city. Lee realized that the situation was getting worse and something had to be done.</p>

    <h2>Examples of the Threat in Korea</h2>
    <p>The Korean Peninsula has been one of the most dangerous places in the world for decades. North Korea's nuclear and missile programs have been a major threat to the safety and security of the region. With a range of nearly 8,000 km, North Korea has the capability to target not only South Korea but also Japan, Guam and even the United States. In addition to the missile program, North Korea has a massive army that has been equipped with modern weapons and advanced technology.</p>

    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <h3>1. Israel:</h3>
    <p>Israel is another country that has been under a constant threat of missile attacks from its neighboring countries. To counter the threat, Israel has deployed a missile defense system called Iron Dome, which intercepts and destroys missiles before they can reach their targets. Since its deployment in 2011, Iron Dome has intercepted over 2,500 rockets fired at Israel from Gaza and Lebanon. The system has proven to be effective in protecting the civilian population and critical infrastructure such as airports, seaports, and power plants.</p>
    <h3>2. Saudi Arabia:</h3>
    <p>Saudi Arabia has been targeted by missile attacks from Yemeni rebels who are supported by Iran. As a result, Saudi Arabia deployed a missile defense system called Patriot PAC-2 and PAC-3, which intercepts incoming missiles. The system has been very effective in preventing damage and casualties. In 2019, a Patriot missile defense system intercepted a ballistic missile fired at Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Based on the threat posed by North Korea, the full deployment of THAAD in Korea is a strategic move. THAAD is an advanced missile defense system that can intercept missiles in the terminal phase of flight. The deployment of THAAD in Korea has several benefits:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>THAAD can provide a protective shield against North Korean missiles, which can prevent damage and casualties.</li>
     <li>THAAD can boost the morale of the Korean people and demonstrate the commitment of the United States to the security of its ally, Korea.</li>
     <li>THAAD can deter North Korea from launching a missile attack, which can reduce the tension and create the conditions for diplomatic negotiations.</li>
    </ol>
