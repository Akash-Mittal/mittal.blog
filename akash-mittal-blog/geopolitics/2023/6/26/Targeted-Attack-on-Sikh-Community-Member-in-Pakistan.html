   <p>On 2nd July 2021, a member of the Sikh community, Nankana Sahib Gurdwara chairman Charanjit Singh, was attacked in broad daylight by two motorcycle-borne gunmen in Pakistan's Punjab province. Singh was shot outside his home in the city of Peshawar and sustained injuries. The incident has raised concerns in India about the safety and security of the Sikh community members living in Pakistan.</p>
   <p>Charanjit Singh is not the only victim of such targeted attacks. In recent years, several members of the Sikh community have been attacked or killed in Pakistan. In April 2020, an attack at a Sikh Gurdwara in Kabul, Afghanistan, claimed 25 lives, including women and children. In the same year, a Sikh youth was murdered in Peshawar, and a prominent Sikh rights activist was shot dead in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. These incidents have prompted the Sikh community members in Pakistan to demand better security arrangements.</p>
   <h2>Case Study: Killing of Ravinder Singh</h2>
   <p>In 2016, Ravinder Singh, a Sikh trader, was shot dead in his grocery shop by two motorcycle-borne assailants in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Buner district. Singh's killing was one of the many instances of targeted attacks on the Sikh community members in Pakistan. After his death, the community members took to the streets to demand justice for Singh and better security policies. However, the case is still under investigation, and the killers are yet to be caught.</p>

   <p>The incidents mentioned above indicate a worrying trend of targeted attacks on the Sikh community members in Pakistan. It is not only the Sikh community but also the religious minority groups in Pakistan that face discrimination, violence, and persecution. The government needs to address these issues and ensure the safety and security of all its citizens.</p>
