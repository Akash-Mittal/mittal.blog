    <h2>An interesting story</h2>
    <p>Cricket is a sport loved and followed by millions of people worldwide. It's not just a game but a way of life for many. The passion for the sport is such that sometimes even small statements can lead to controversy and debates. One such statement is the recent comment made by Ex-Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali, who ripped apart Team India's head coach Rahul Dravid.</p>
    <p>Basit Ali said that Rahul Dravid is "absolutely zero" as a coach. He also went on to add that with Dravid as the senior coach of the Indian cricket team, it will be tough for India to compete effectively in the upcoming T20 World Cup. These comments by Basit Ali have sparked a lot of controversy in the cricketing world.</p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>Basit Ali's comments might come across as harsh, but there could be some truth in what he said. Here are some examples:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Since Rahul Dravid took over as the head coach of the Indian cricket team, India has played a total of 10 T20 games, out of which they have won only 5 and lost 5.</li>
     <li>During the recent India-England T20 series, India struggled in the batting department, and their middle-order collapsed on multiple occasions. This raised questions about Rahul Dravid's tactics and strategies as a coach.</li>
     <li>Many cricket experts feel that India's current T20 squad lacks balance, and there are some questionable selections in the team. This is again a failure on the coach's part to pick the right players.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These examples show that Basit Ali's comment may have some basis in reality.</p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <h2>Case studies</h2>
    <p>Let's look at some case studies to understand what it takes to be a successful T20 coach:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Mike Hesson, the head coach of Kings XI Punjab in the Indian Premier League (IPL), is considered to be one of the best T20 coaches in the world. He has a win percentage of over 51%, and his teams have made it to the playoffs on multiple occasions.</li>
     <li>Another successful T20 coach is Trevor Bayliss. Under his coaching, the Kolkata Knight Riders won the IPL twice, and he also led the Sydney Sixers to the Big Bash League title in 2011-12.</li>
     <li>Gary Kirsten, who coached the Indian cricket team from 2008 to 2011, is another successful T20 coach. Under his leadership, India won the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These case studies show that successful T20 coaches have a good understanding of the game, great man-management skills, and the ability to pick the right players.</p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <h2>Conclusion in 3 points</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>Rahul Dravid's performance as the head coach of the Indian cricket team has been mixed so far.</li>
     <li>While there may be some truth in Basit Ali's comment, it's too early to write off Rahul Dravid as a coach.</li>
     <li>To be a successful T20 coach, one needs to have a good understanding of the game, great man-management skills, and the ability to pick the right players.</li>
    </ol>
