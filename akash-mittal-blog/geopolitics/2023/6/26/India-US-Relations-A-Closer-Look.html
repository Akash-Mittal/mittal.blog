    <p>It was a sunny afternoon in Washington D.C. The White House was bustling with activity as top officials were preparing for the arrival of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. As the clock struck three, a black limousine pulled up at the gate. Out stepped Prime Minister Modi, dressed in an elegant kurta and pajama. He was greeted by President Donald Trump who welcomed him to the White House with a warm handshake. The two leaders then proceeded to hold a closed-door meeting regarding various matters of national and international importance.</p>
    <p>This was the fourth time that the two leaders had met in the past three years. Their relationship had grown stronger with each passing year, and both Modi and Trump had acknowledged the fact that their personal rapport had played a significant role in strengthening the ties between India and the United States.</p>

    <h2>The History of India-US Relations</h2>
    <p>The history of India-US relations dates back to the early 1940s, when India was still under British colonial rule. The US played a pivotal role in supporting India's freedom struggle, and leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru had close ties with prominent leftist thinkers in the US. After India gained independence in 1947, the US recognized India as a sovereign nation and established diplomatic ties.</p>
    <p>However, the relationship between the two nations has not always been smooth. In the 1960s, India's close ties with the Soviet Union irked the US, which viewed the socialist bloc as a threat to its global domination. The US also opposed India's nuclear program, which it claimed was a threat to regional stability.</p>
    <p>It was only in the 1990s that India-US relations started to improve significantly. India's economic liberalization and pro-Western tilt under Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao paved the way for a closer relationship with the US. The US also recognized India as a nuclear power in the early 2000s, further cementing the ties between the two nations.</p>
