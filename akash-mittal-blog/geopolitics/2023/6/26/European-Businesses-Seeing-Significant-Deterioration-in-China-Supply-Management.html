  <p>Once upon a time, European businesses were thrilled with the opportunities in China. They could manufacture products cheaply, take advantage of government incentives, and tap into the world's largest consumer market. However, things have changed over the years. Today, European businesses are facing a 'significant deterioration' in China, affecting many areas of trade and investment.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Significant Deterioration in China</h2>
  <p>European businesses are facing numerous pressures and challenges in China. The country continues to tighten regulations around foreign investment, making it harder for European companies to do business. There have been reports of increased bureaucracy, red tape, and the slow pace of approvals for licenses, permits, and certifications. Additionally, European businesses are struggling to comply with local standards and cultural differences, which can create additional barriers to entry.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>One company that is feeling the impact of the 'significant deterioration' in China is German luxury carmaker BMW. In 2018, the company reported that sales in China had declined by 7%. They noted that the trade war between China and the US, as well as the country's changing economic environment, were largely responsible for the decrease.</p>
  <p>Similarly, French retail giant Carrefour has struggled in China. The company has closed several stores and changed its business strategy in light of increased competition from other retail chains and e-commerce platforms like Alibaba and Jingdong. In 2018, Carrefour sold 80% of its China business to Chinese tech firm Tencent and supermarket chain Yonghui, highlighting the challenges that European businesses face when doing business in China.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>It's clear that European businesses are facing a 'significant deterioration' in China. With ongoing challenges in trade, investment regulation, cultural differences, and local standards, many European companies are struggling to maintain a foothold in the world's largest consumer market. Here are three key takeaways from this article:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>European businesses are struggling to do business in China because of changing regulations, bureaucracy, and cultural barriers.</li>
   <li>Many European companies are experiencing declines in sales and market share due to increased competition from Chinese firms and changing market conditions.</li>
   <li>The road ahead looks challenging for European businesses in China, and companies will need to adapt their strategies and work closely with local partners to succeed.</li>
  </ul>
