     <h2>Story</h2>
     <p>The BRICS grouping, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, has become an important platform for cooperation and economic growth among member countries. With the BRICS leaders' summit scheduled to be held in Johannesburg, South Africa in July 2018, the member countries are considering the prospect of expansion. The summit will focus on "BRICS in Africa", highlighting the opportunities and challenges of BRICS-Africa cooperation.</p>

    <section id="examples">
     <h2>Examples</h2>
     <p>One example of BRICS-Africa cooperation is the China-Africa Development Fund, which was launched in 2007 with a focus on investing in infrastructure, agriculture, manufacturing and other industries in Africa. The fund has helped to build schools, hospitals, roads, railways, ports and power plants across the continent. Another example is the India-Brazil-South Africa (IBSA) Trilateral Commission, which was established in 2003 to promote cooperation among the three countries in areas such as trade, investment, science and technology, culture and education.</p>

     <h2>Case Studies</h2>
     <h3>China's Investment in Africa</h3>
     <p>China has been investing heavily in Africa in recent years, with loans, grants, aid and trade. China's loans to Africa increased from $1.5 billion in 2005 to $16.8 billion in 2014, according to the China Africa Research Initiative (CARI) at Johns Hopkins University. These loans have financed infrastructure projects such as railways, roads, ports, airports and power plants. For example, China helped to build the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway in Kenya, the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway in Ethiopia, and the Maputo-Catembe Bridge in Mozambique. These projects have helped to boost economic growth and create jobs in Africa, but some critics have raised concerns about debt sustainability and environmental impact.</p>
     <h3>India's Trade with Africa</h3>
     <p>India's trade with Africa has been growing rapidly in recent years, reaching $62.5 billion in 2016-17, according to the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). India's imports from Africa include crude oil, gold, diamonds, copper and other minerals, while its exports to Africa include pharmaceuticals, machinery, vehicles, textiles and other goods. Some Indian companies have also invested in Africa, such as Bharti Airtel in telecom, Tata in automobiles, and Cipla in pharmaceuticals. India has also provided aid and technical assistance to African countries, such as the Pan African e-Network project, which was launched in 2007 to connect African countries in the fields of tele-education and tele-medicine.</p>
