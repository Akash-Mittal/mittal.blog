    <p>It's a story as old as time - Bollywood appropriating cultural elements from neighboring countries and passing them off as their own. This time, it's the song 'Pasoori Nu' from the upcoming movie 'Satyaprem Ki Katha', starring Kartik Aaryan and Kiara Advani, that has enraged fans in Pakistan.</p>
    <p>The song, which is a remake of a traditional Pakistani folk song, was released on July 28th, 2021 and has since been criticized for its blatant cultural appropriation. Fans have taken to social media to express their outrage, accusing Bollywood of stealing cultural heritage from Pakistan without giving credit where it's due.</p>
    <p>One fan tweeted, "Why can't Bollywood give credit where it's due? 'Pasoori Nu' is a Pakistani folk song, and they've completely ripped it off without any acknowledgement."</p>
    <p>Another fan shared a video of the original Pakistani version of the song and called out Bollywood for stealing from Pakistan yet again.</p>

    <p>This is not the first time Bollywood has been accused of cultural appropriation. In fact, it's become a common practice in the industry to take traditional songs and dance moves from neighboring countries and pass them off as their own. Some examples of this include:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>The song 'Gori Gori' from the movie 'Main Hoon Na' was copied from the Bangladeshi song 'Koshto Pete Bhalobashi'.</li>
     <li>The song 'Sau Tarah Ke' from the movie 'Dishoom' was copied from the Lebanese song 'Bhebak Enta'.</li>
     <li>The song 'Afghan Jalebi' from the movie 'Phantom' was copied from the Afghan song 'Laila O Laila'.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These examples highlight the rampant cultural appropriation that occurs in Bollywood. While some argue that it's a form of cultural exchange, others argue that it's a blatant disrespect for the cultural heritage of other countries.</p>
    <h2>Case studies</h2>
    <p>The case of 'Pasoori Nu' is just one of the many instances of Bollywood's cultural appropriation. In fact, it's become so common that it's hard to keep track of all the instances. However, here are a few notable cases:</p>
    <h3>The Chaiyya Chaiyya Controversy</h3>
    <p>The song 'Chaiyya Chaiyya' from the movie 'Dil Se' became a massive hit in India and around the world. However, it was later revealed that the song was a direct copy of a song called 'Thayya Thayya' by Pakistani artist Arif Lohar. Despite this, Bollywood continued to pass the song off as their own without giving any credit to the original artist.</p>
    <h3>The Nagada Sang Dhol Controversy</h3>
    <p>The song 'Nagada Sang Dhol' from the movie 'Ram Leela' was accused of cultural appropriation because it used the traditional garba dance, which is a cultural staple of the Gujarati community in India. However, the dance was performed in a way that was completely different from the traditional garba dance, leading to accusations of cultural misappropriation.</p>
    <h3>The Munni Badnaam Hui Controversy</h3>
    <p>The song 'Munni Badnaam Hui' from the movie 'Dabangg' became a massive hit in India, but it was soon revealed that the song was a direct copy of a song called 'Ladka Badnaam Hua' by Pakistani artist Zahoor Ahmad Lohar. Despite this, Bollywood continued to pass the song off as their own without giving any credit to the original artist.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The issue of cultural appropriation in Bollywood is a complex one. While some argue that it's a form of cultural exchange, others argue that it's a blatant disrespect for the cultural heritage of other countries. However, there are a few key takeaways from this discussion:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Bollywood needs to start giving credit where it's due. If they are going to appropriate elements from other cultures, they need to acknowledge the original creators and give them credit.</li>
     <li>Bollywood needs to start respecting the cultural heritage of other countries. They need to stop appropriating cultural elements and instead focus on learning from and collaborating with other cultures.</li>
     <li>Fans have a role to play in calling out cultural appropriation when they see it. By using social media to raise awareness about these issues, they can hold Bollywood accountable for their actions.</li>
