    <p>It was supposed to be a thrilling match between India and Pakistan in the South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) Championship on 7th September 2021. But the excitement was marred by some unfortunate incidents that left the Pakistan team in complete disarray.</p>
    <p>The Pakistani footballers faced major visa issues during their trip to India for the championship. The team was supposed to arrive in India a week before the tournament but could only make it three days prior due to visa delays. The situation was so grave that Pakistan coach Mohammed Adil was forced to make do with only ten players in the match against India which they eventually lost 7-1.</p>
    <p>Having a full squad of players is essential in any game but it becomes even more crucial when it comes to football. Losing players to injuries and visa issues is something that could seriously impact a team's performance. It's not just the team's morale that takes a hit, but the overall gameplay is also impacted.</p>
    <h2>An Example from History</h2>
    <p>This is not the first time that visa issues have impacted the performance of a sports team. In the 2019 Asian Wrestling Championships held in Xi'an, China, six wrestlers from Pakistan could not even participate due to visa issues. The team was set to take part in different weight categories but could not make it to the tournament on time due to the visa delays.</p>
    <p>One of these wrestlers, Inam Butt, had won the first-ever wrestling gold medal for Pakistan in the 2018 Commonwealth Games. His absence was a significant setback to Pakistan's chances in the tournament. Though Pakistan managed to win its first-ever gold medal in the Asian Wrestling Championships, the absence of these players due to visa issues caused by political tensions left a sour taste in everyone's mouth.</p>
    <h2>Case Study of a Footballer</h2>
    <p>The effects of visa issues are not just on team performances but also on an individual level. Take the case of the Syrian footballer Firas Al-Khatib, for example. The striker, who is also a refugee, was unable to play in the 2017 Asian Cup Qualifiers held in Malaysia due to visa issues.</p>
    <p>Khatib, who was later called the "David Beckham of Syria," had to sit out on his country's crucial match against Uzbekistan. Syria needed to win this game to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The team eventually lost 1-0. Many Syrians felt that if Khatib had been there, the outcome would have been different. This incident highlights the importance of timely issuance of visas and proper scheduling for sports events so that sportspeople don't face difficulties in traveling to attend the competitions.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The issue of visa delays, especially in sporting events, is something that needs to be addressed by the concerned authorities. Visa issues not only impact the performance of the team but also affect an individual player's mental and physical health. Here are three points that the authorities need to focus on to avoid such incidents:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>A proper schedule should be followed, taking into account the time required for visa processing.</li>
     <li>The authorities should provide necessary assistance to sports teams in obtaining visas so that they can participate in international events without hindrance.</li>
     <li>The fastest and most secure ways of visa processing should be adopted so that the process doesn't get delayed due to political tensions or other uncertainties.</li>
    </ol>
