    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>In 2008, a terrorist attack in Mumbai, India killed over 160 people and injured hundreds more. The attack was planned and carried out by a group linked to the Pakistani militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba. Among the masterminds of the attack was Sajid Mir, a known terrorist who has evaded justice for years.</p>
    <p>Recently, the United States and India have been pushing for the designation of Sajid Mir as a terrorist by the United Nations. However, there is one major hurdle in this effort: China's veto power in the UN Security Council.</p>
   </section>
   <section id="examples">
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>China has a long-standing alliance with Pakistan, which has led to its vetoing of several attempts to designate Pakistani terrorists as international terrorists. For example, in 2016, China vetoed the designation of Jaish-e-Mohammed leader Masood Azhar as a terrorist, even though the group was responsible for a deadly attack on an Indian Air Force base.</p>
    <p>Similarly, in 2010, China vetoed a proposal to add Lashkar-e-Taiba leader Hafiz Saeed to the UN's list of designated terrorists. Saeed is believed to have planned the Mumbai attacks and continues to be a free man in Pakistan.</p>
    <p>China's veto power has also hindered efforts to designate North Korean individuals and entities as terrorists, which has been a major point of contention between China and the United States.</p>

    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <h3>Masood Azhar</h3>
    <p>In 2016, the United States, Britain, and France proposed to the UN Security Council that Jaish-e-Mohammed leader Masood Azhar be designated as a terrorist. However, China blocked the move by placing a hold on the proposal and eventually vetoing it, citing "technical reasons."</p>
    <p>This led to protests in India, with some calling for boycotts of Chinese products and others calling for a review of India's "One China Policy." The move also strained ties between India and China, which were already tense due to border disputes in the Himalayas.</p>
    <h3>Hafiz Saeed</h3>
    <p>In 2010, the United States, Britain, and France proposed to the UN Security Council that Lashkar-e-Taiba leader Hafiz Saeed be designated as a terrorist. However, China and some other council members blocked the move, claiming that the evidence against Saeed was not strong enough and that due process had not been followed.</p>
    <p>Saeed remains a free man in Pakistan, where he continues to operate openly and lead Lashkar-e-Taiba's activities. This has led to criticism of Pakistan's failure to crack down on terrorism and calls for international pressure to be exerted on the country.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>China's veto power in the UN Security Council has been a major obstacle in efforts to designate known terrorists as international terrorists.</li>
     <li>This has led to criticism of China's close ties with countries like Pakistan and North Korea, which have been accused of supporting terrorism.</li>
     <li>The international community must work together to find alternate means of putting pressure on these countries and individuals to ensure justice is served.</li>
