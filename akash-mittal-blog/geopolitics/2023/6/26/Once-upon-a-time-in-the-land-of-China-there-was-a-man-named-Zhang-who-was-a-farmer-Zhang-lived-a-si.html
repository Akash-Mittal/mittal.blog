  <title>Once upon a time, in the land of China, there was a man named Zhang who was a farmer. Zhang lived a simple life with his family and spent most of his time tending to his crops. One day, while ploughing his land, he stumbled upon a strange-looking plant. Upon closer inspection, he realized that it was a type of tea plant that he had never seen before. He decided to harvest the plant and brew a cup of tea. To his surprise, it had a unique flavor that was entirely different from any other tea he had tasted before. This tea plant was the beginning of China's tea culture, which has since then spread all over the world. </title>
