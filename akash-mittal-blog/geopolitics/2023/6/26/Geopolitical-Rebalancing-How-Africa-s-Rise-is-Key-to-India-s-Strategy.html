   <p>Once, long ago in the 1950s, a young farsighted Indian Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, stood at the podium of the Pan-African Conference in Accra, Ghana. Nehru saw Africa as ripe for decolonisation and urged leaders to fight for their sovereignty, solidarity, and unity while promising India's support for their quest. Sixty years later, Africa's growing economic, political, and cultural power is poised to play a crucial role in India's strategy of rebalancing geopolitical power in a shifting world.</p>
   <h2>The Importance of India-Africa Ties</h2>
   <p>Africa's rise matters for India, and not just for sentimental reasons. As Jaishankar S. Jaishankar, India's External Affairs Minister, noted in an interview with The Economic Times, Africa will significantly impact India's agenda for greater international influence. India-Africa ties have evolved beyond traditional areas of cooperation such as agriculture, health care, education, and infrastructure. Today, they encompass diverse areas of strategic importance, from energy security to trade, peace and security to climate change, and science and technology to human capital development.</p>
   <p>At present, India is among the top three investors in Africa, with an estimated USD 54 billion in commitments as of 2021. In terms of trade, India is Africa's third-largest partner behind China and the European Union, although its trade deficit has been a source of concern for policymakers. Nonetheless, as Africa emerges as a manufacturing hub and a market of 1.3 billion people, India is keen to deepen its commercial ties. At the geopolitical level, India has championed Africa's cause in multilateral forums like the UN, with Nehru's legacy echoing in India's support for a more democratic and inclusive global governance architecture.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies of India-Africa Partnership</h2>
   <p>India's partnerships with Ethiopia and Rwanda illustrate the strategic importance of Africa to India's global agenda. Ethiopia was the first African country to establish diplomatic ties with India in 1948, and since then, the partnership has grown in strength, with key areas of cooperation ranging from agriculture to hydroelectric power, education to tourism. India was a lead partner in the construction of the Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway line, which has transformed Ethiopia into a regional transportation hub. In the education sector, India has trained thousands of Ethiopian students and professionals in various disciplines under its Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme.</p>
   <p>Rwanda, a relatively newer partner, has attracted India's attention due to its impressive strides in innovation and economic growth. India has helped Rwanda establish a High Commission in New Delhi, which has helped facilitate greater two-way investment and trade. India has also set up an Entrepreneurship Development Centre in Kigali, which trains young Rwandans in business skills and incubates start-ups. And during the pandemic, India extended vital medical assistance to Rwanda, demonstrating the depth and resilience of their partnership.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The rise of Africa and India's growing engagement with the continent is more critical than ever. In a world where China's economic and military expansion has upended geopolitical equations, and the global South seeks a more equitable share in decision-making processes, India's Africa policy is integral to its strategy and values. The three key takeaways from this article are:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>The strategic importance of Africa extends beyond traditional areas of support to encompass energy security, climate change, and a more democratic global order.</li>
    <li>India's Africa policy is evolving, with more significant investments, deeper commercial ties, and a shared focus on human capital development, innovation, and entrepreneurship.</li>
    <li>The success of India-Africa partnerships depends on trust, understanding, and a recognition of each other's interests and challenges, as exemplified by India's partnerships with Ethiopia and Rwanda.</li>
   </ol>
   <p>Ultimately, Africa's rise is an opportunity for India and the world to do better by creating a more equitable and prosperous global order. As Nehru once said, "we live in a fundamentally interdependent world which is becoming just one world."</p>
