  <p>It was a chilly autumn afternoon in Minsk, Belarus, when I first met Anna (not her real name). Anna was a university professor who taught political science but had to keep her political views to herself to avoid being targeted by the government. Over hot cups of tea and pastries, we talked about democracy, human rights, and government repression in Belarus.</p>
  <p>Anna was hopeful that democracy would eventually take root in Belarus, but also realistic about the challenges. She knew that the government was not going to give up power easily and that the opposition was divided and weak. She also knew that foreign governments and NGOs were funding pro-democracy groups, which could do more harm than good by inviting government crackdowns and labeling opposition leaders as foreign puppets.</p>
  <p>As we parted ways, Anna told me something that stuck with me: "If foreign powers want to help Belarus, they should focus on their own interests and not on promoting democracy. That way, they can work with the government and civil society to achieve common goals and avoid unnecessary tensions and risks."</p><!--Examples-->
  <h2>Examples of Pursuing Geo-Strategic Interests in Belarus</h2>
  <p>Since gaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Belarus has been under the authoritarian rule of Alexander Lukashenko, who has consolidated power, suppressed dissent, and maintained close ties with Russia. Belarus has also been subject to international sanctions and isolation, due to its poor human rights record and disputed elections.</p>
  <p>However, some countries have pursued their geo-strategic interests in Belarus, despite these obstacles. For instance, China has invested in infrastructure projects, such as the China-Belarus Industrial Park, which aims to attract Chinese companies and stimulate economic growth. China sees Belarus as a key link in its Belt and Road Initiative, which seeks to expand its economic and political influence globally.</p>
  <p>Similarly, the United States has engaged with Belarus on issues of mutual concern, such as nuclear security and counterterrorism. In 2019, the US lifted some sanctions on Belarus to promote trade and investment, and sent a high-level delegation to Minsk, headed by Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan. The visit was seen as a sign of thawing relations between the two countries, after years of hostility.</p><!--Case Studies-->
  <h2>Case Studies of Geo-Strategic Interests vs. Direct Democracy Promotion in Belarus</h2>
  <h3>Belarus-Russia Relations</h3>
  <p>Belarus and Russia have a complicated relationship, marked by political, economic, and military ties. On the one hand, Belarus relies on Russia for energy supplies and trade, and considers Russia its ally and partner. On the other hand, Belarus has resisted Russian attempts to dominate its economy and politics, and has tried to maintain its independence and sovereignty.</p>
  <p>This balancing act has become more difficult in recent years, as Russia has put pressure on Belarus to deepen integration and accept closer ties, including a proposed union state. Belarus has resisted these moves, seeing them as a threat to its identity and autonomy. Russia has responded by cutting off oil supplies to Belarus and increasing its military presence along the border.</p>
  <p>From a geo-strategic perspective, Belarus is important to both Russia and the West, due to its location between Europe and Asia, its access to the Baltic Sea, and its potential as a transit hub for energy and trade. Russia sees Belarus as a buffer zone against NATO expansion and a potential launchpad for military operations. The West sees Belarus as a potential partner for democratic reform and as a bulwark against Russian aggression.</p>
  <p>These competing interests have shaped the policies of the major players in the Belarus-Russia-West triangle. Russia has tended to support Lukashenko and oppose Western intervention. The West has tended to criticize Lukashenko and support civil society and opposition groups, but has also sought engagement and dialogue with Lukashenko on pragmatic issues. Belarus has tried to balance between the two sides, seeking economic benefits from Russia and political support from the West.</p>
  <h3>China-Belarus Relations</h3>
  <p>China and Belarus have strengthened their ties in recent years, through the Belt and Road Initiative and other economic cooperation projects. China sees Belarus as a strategic partner in Europe, due to its location, relative political stability, and potential market. Belarus sees China as a source of investment, technology, and international leverage.</p>
  <p>However, China's engagement with Belarus has raised concerns about debt, corruption, and dependence. Some experts warn that China's investments in Belarus could have negative impacts on social, environmental, and political issues, and could undermine the country's sovereignty and democracy. Others argue that China's engagement with Belarus is a balancing act against Russia and the West, and that it can promote economic development and regional stability.</p><!--Conclusion-->
  <h2>Conclusion: Lessons Learned</h2>
  <p>The case of Belarus shows that pursuing geo-strategic interests may be more productive than direct democracy promotion, especially in countries where the government is authoritarian, the opposition is weak, and the civil society is vulnerable. By focusing on common goals and shared interests, foreign powers can work with the government and the civil society to achieve positive outcomes, while avoiding unnecessary tensions and risks.</p>
  <p>Some lessons learned from the Belarus policy include:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Engagement is more effective than sanctions in achieving results, especially when there is no consensus on regime change or military intervention.</li>
   <li>Pragmatism is more effective than ideology in achieving influence, especially when there is no clear pro-democracy movement or civil society network.</li>
   <li>Balancing is more effective than siding in achieving stability, especially when there is no clear threat or opportunity for one side to dominate the other.</li>
