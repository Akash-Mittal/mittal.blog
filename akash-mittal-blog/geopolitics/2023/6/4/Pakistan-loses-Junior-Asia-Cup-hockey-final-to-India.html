   <h2>An analysis of what went wrong for Pakistan</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>It was a tense match between Pakistan and India in the final of the Junior Asia Cup hockey tournament. The players on both sides were giving their all, and the crowd was on the edge of their seats. But in the end, it was India who came out on top, winning 2-1 against their rivals.</p>
   <h3>Examples of what went wrong for Pakistan</h3>
   <p>There were a few key factors that contributed to Pakistan's defeat in the final. One of the main issues was their lack of discipline on the field. They gave away too many penalties and allowed India to take advantage of the extra player. In fact, one of India's goals came from a penalty corner.</p>
   <p>Another issue was Pakistan's inability to convert their chances into goals. They had several opportunities to score but failed to capitalize on them. This was in stark contrast to India, who made the most of their limited chances and scored two goals.</p>
   <h3>Case studies to support our analysis</h3>
   <p>One example of Pakistan's discipline issues was when they were down to 10 players after a player received a yellow card. India immediately took advantage of the situation and scored a goal, making it difficult for Pakistan to come back into the game.</p>
   <p>Another example was when Pakistan gave away a penalty corner towards the end of the match. India made no mistake in converting the opportunity into a goal, effectively sealing the win for themselves.</p>
   <h3>Conclusion</h3>
   <p>In conclusion, Pakistan's lack of discipline and inability to convert chances cost them the match against India. It's a lesson for the team to work on these areas and improve in future matches. India, on the other hand, played with confidence and made the most of their opportunities, earning them the championship trophy.</p>
