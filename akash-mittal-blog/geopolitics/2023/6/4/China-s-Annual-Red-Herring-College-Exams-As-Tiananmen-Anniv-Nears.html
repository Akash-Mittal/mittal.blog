  <h1>China's Annual Red Herring College Exams As Tiananmen Anniv Nears</h1> <img src="images/China-s-Annual-Red-Herring-College-Exams-As-Tiananmen-Anniv-Nears.jpeg" alt="+China-s-Annual-Red-Herring-College-Exams-As-Tiananmen-Anniv-Nears+">
  <p>As China approaches the anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, the government is taking extra measures to prevent any unrest. One of these measures is the annual Red Herring College Exams, in which students are tested on their knowledge of the Communist Party's political ideology.</p>
  <p>The exams are designed to promote loyalty to the party and weed out any dissenting views. Students who perform well on the exams are rewarded with scholarships and other benefits, while those who do poorly may face disciplinary action.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Red Herring College Exams</h2>
  <p>One example of a question on the Red Herring College Exam is:</p>
  <blockquote>
   According to Marxist theory, which class holds the key to social change?
  </blockquote>
  <p>Another example is:</p>
  <blockquote>
   In the fight against "bourgeois liberalization," what is the role of the press?
  </blockquote>
  <p>These questions are designed to reinforce the party's ideology and discourage independent thinking. Students who answer correctly are seen as loyal to the party, while those who answer incorrectly may be seen as potential troublemakers.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>One famous case of a student challenging the party's ideology was that of Yue Xin, a Peking University graduate who was involved in a campus protest in 2018. Yue was later targeted by the party and had her social media accounts deleted.</p>
  <p>Another example is that of Ding Xiuxia, a student at Zhongnan University of Economics and Law who was stripped of her scholarship in 2018 after questioning the party's handling of the Sichuan earthquake in 2008.</p>
  <p>Both of these cases illustrate the risks of challenging the party's ideology in China. Students who speak out against the government may face serious consequences, including loss of scholarships, expulsion from school, or even imprisonment.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The Red Herring College Exams are just one of the ways in which the Chinese government seeks to maintain control over its population. By promoting loyalty to the party and discouraging independent thinking, the exams help ensure that the party's power remains unchallenged.</p>
  <p>However, the exams also have a chilling effect on free speech and critical thinking. Students who are afraid to voice their opinions or challenge the party's ideology may be less likely to engage in critical thinking or come up with innovative ideas.</p>
  <p>In the end, the Red Herring College Exams serve as a reminder of the government's power and the risks of challenging its authority.</p>
