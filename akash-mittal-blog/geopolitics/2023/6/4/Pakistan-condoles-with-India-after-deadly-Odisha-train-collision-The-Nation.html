    <h2>Anecdote: The Power of Condolences</h2>
    <p>When a tragedy strikes, the power of condolences is immense. It not only serves as a comfort to the grieving families but also as a message of unity and support. In 2015, when a terrorist attack occurred in Paris, the world stood in shock. Messages of solidarity and condolences poured in from all over the world, including Pakistan. The Pakistani embassy in France lowered its flag to half-mast and lit candles in remembrance of the victims. This gesture demonstrated that humanity is above all and should not be restricted by borders or biases.</p>
    <p>Similarly, the recent train collision in Odisha, India, that claimed the lives of at least 50 people, has prompted Pakistan to extend its heartfelt condolences to its neighboring country. Pakistan's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, expressed his sorrow over the loss of lives and injuries in the tragic incident. He also wished speedy recovery for those injured in the mishap. This gesture from Pakistan shows that even though the two countries have had a tumultuous history, basic human compassion prevails.</p>

    <h2>Case Studies: The Importance of Quick Responses</h2>
    <p>Tragedies can occur any time, and it is important for countries to respond quickly to extend their support and condolences. Here are two case studies demonstrating the importance of quick responses:</p>
    <h3>1) Christchurch Mosque Shootings</h3>
    <p>In March 2019, a terrorist attack took place on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, that claimed the lives of at least 50 people. This attack sent shockwaves throughout the world. Pakistan's Prime Minister, Imran Khan, was the first world leader to condemn the attack and express his condolences to the families of the victims. He tweeted, "I blame these increasing terror attacks on the current Islamophobia post-9/11 where Islam and 1.3 bn Muslims have collectively been blamed for any act of terror by a Muslim." This quick response led to many other countries following suit in condemning the attack and expressing their condolences.</p>
    <h3>2) Nepal Earthquake</h3>
    <p>In April 2015, a massive earthquake struck Nepal, claiming the lives of over 8,000 people and injuring thousands more. Pakistan was one of the first countries to send aid and support to Nepal. The Pakistan Air Force dispatched C-130 planes carrying a field hospital, rescue teams, and relief goods to the affected areas. This quick response and display of solidarity not only helped Nepal cope with the aftermath of the tragedy but also strengthened the ties between the two countries.</p>
