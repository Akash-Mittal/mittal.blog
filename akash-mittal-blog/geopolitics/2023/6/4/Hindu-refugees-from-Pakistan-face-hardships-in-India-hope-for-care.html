  <h1>Hindu refugees from Pakistan face hardships in India, hope for care</h1> <img src="images/Hindu-refugees-from-Pakistan-face-hardships-in-India-hope-for-care.jpeg" alt="+Hindu-refugees-from-Pakistan-face-hardships-in-India-hope-for-care+">
  <p>India has a long history of providing asylum to people fleeing religious persecution. In recent years, many Hindu refugees from Pakistan have sought shelter in India due to increasing discrimination and violence against them in their homeland. However, their struggles for survival continue even after they arrive in India.</p>
  <h2>Stories of hardship</h2>
  <p>Sat Ram, a 62-year-old Hindu refugee from Sindh, Pakistan, arrived in India in 2012 along with his wife and two children. They fled their home after their house was burnt down by a group of people who held a grudge against them for being Hindus. When they arrived in India, they hoped to get a better life, but what they found was a series of hardships.</p>
  <p>Firstly, they had to spend several days living on the streets of Delhi, without proper food and shelter. Even though they were eventually able to find a small apartment to live in, their troubles were not over. Sat Ram had to work as a daily wage laborer to make ends meet, but finding a job was not easy for him. His lack of understanding of Hindi and the fact that he did not have any identity proof made it difficult for him to get a permanent job.</p>
  <p>His children faced similar struggles in school, where they were often discriminated against by teachers and other students for being Pakistanis. They were also unable to get admission to higher education institutions due to their refugee status. Sat Ram's wife, who suffers from asthma, finds it hard to access proper medical care as they do not have any health insurance.</p>
  <h2>Case studies</h2>
  <p>Sat Ram's story is just one of many, as the struggles of Hindu refugees from Pakistan are widespread in India. According to a report by Al Jazeera, there are around 1,500 Hindu refugee families from Pakistan living in Delhi alone, and many of them are facing similar challenges.</p>
  <p>Kamal Jaiswal, a social activist who has been working with these refugees, says that they face discrimination at every level of society. "They are denied jobs, houses, and even basic services like water and electricity. They are treated as second-class citizens," he says.</p>
  <p>The situation is particularly grim for women refugees. Many of them are forced to work in hazardous conditions in factories or as domestic workers, often for very low wages. They are also vulnerable to sexual harassment and violence.</p>
  <p>The plight of these refugees has been exacerbated by recent legislative changes in India. In 2019, the government passed the controversial Citizenship Amendment Bill, which proposed to grant citizenship to non-Muslim refugees from neighboring countries, including Pakistan. While the bill was welcomed by many Hindu refugees, it also sparked protests in India as it was seen as discriminatory against Muslims.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, in September 2020, the Delhi government canceled the PAN cards of around 200 Hindu refugees from Pakistan. A PAN card is a mandatory identity proof required for various financial transactions and services in India. The refugees were told that they would not be issued new PAN cards unless they produced documents proving their Indian citizenship.</p>
  <h2>A hope for care</h2>
  <p>Despite these challenges, many Hindu refugees from Pakistan remain hopeful for a better future in India. They are grateful for the government's support in granting them asylum, but they also want more assistance in terms of jobs, education, and healthcare.</p>
  <p>The Indian government has taken some steps in this regard. In 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Vanbandhu Kalyan Yojana, a scheme aimed at providing additional financial support and other welfare measures to refugees and other tribal communities in India. Under this scheme, Hindu refugees from Pakistan are eligible for financial assistance of up to Rs 5 lakh for starting their own businesses.</p>
  <p>Organizations like the Sewa Bharti, which run educational and vocational training programs for refugees, are also playing an important role in helping these communities to integrate into Indian society. However, much more needs to be done to address the root causes of their plight, which is religious persecution and discrimination in Pakistan.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The struggles of Hindu refugees from Pakistan are a reminder of the importance of protecting the rights of vulnerable communities. Governments and societies around the world have a moral obligation to provide asylum and care for those fleeing persecution and violence.</p>
  <p>India has a proud tradition of welcoming refugees, but more needs to be done to ensure that they are able to live a dignified life in the country. It is important for the government to address the systemic discrimination and provide more assistance to these refugees in terms of jobs, education, and healthcare.</p>
  <p>In the long run, the solution to this problem lies in addressing the root causes of religious persecution and discrimination in Pakistan. The international community should work together to put pressure on the Pakistani government to respect the rights of its minority communities and ensure their safety and security.</p><!-- Article Category: Society -->
