  <h1>India Needs to Build an In-House Semiconductor Supply Chain: A Tech Today Congress Panel</h1> <img src="images/India-Needs-to-Build-an-In-House-Semiconductor-Supply-Chain-A-Tech-Today-Congress-Panel.jpeg" alt="+India-Needs-to-Build-an-In-House-Semiconductor-Supply-Chain-A-Tech-Today-Congress-Panel+">
  <p>India's semiconductor industry is currently import-dependent, which makes it vulnerable to global supply chain disruptions. To secure the nation's self-sufficiency and boost its manufacturing sector, a panel of experts discussed the need to build an in-house semiconductor supply chain in the recently concluded Tech Today Congress.</p>
  
  <p>In 2019, the US banned Chinese telecom equipment provider Huawei from using American technology, including semiconductors, in its products. As a result, Huawei had to look for alternative suppliers and shifted its orders to TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker based in Taiwan. However, in May 2021, TSMC had to stop taking new orders from Huawei due to US sanctions. This left Huawei with limited options to keep up with the demand for its products, resulting in a decline in its market share.</p>
  <h2>Examples with Case Studies</h2>
  <p>India imports around 85% of its semiconductor requirements from countries like China, Taiwan, and South Korea. This dependence on imports makes the country vulnerable to global supply chain disruptions, like the one faced by Huawei. Furthermore, India's local manufacturing sector is relatively weak, which restricts its ability to produce high-tech products, leading to low levels of innovation and economic growth.</p>
  <p>To address these issues, a panel of experts at the Tech Today Congress discussed the need to build an in-house semiconductor supply chain in India. One of the speakers, Dr. Ajay Kumar, the Secretary of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, emphasized the importance of creating a robust semiconductor ecosystem in the country. He stated that a comprehensive semiconductor policy was under consideration, which would foster research and development, innovation, and manufacturing of semiconductors in collaboration with the private sector and the academia.</p>
  <p>Another panellist, Dr. C. V. Jawahar, a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, spoke about the challenges facing the country's semiconductor industry. He identified the lack of adequate infrastructure, skilled workforce, and financing as major hindrances to creating a sustainable semiconductor ecosystem. Moreover, he stressed that building a local semiconductor industry required a long-term, concerted effort from all stakeholders, including the government, industry, and academia.</p>
  <p>The Indian government has already taken some steps to encourage local semiconductor manufacturing. For instance, in March 2021, the government announced the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for the electronics sector, which includes a provision of INR 7,350 crores ($1 billion) for the development of a domestic semiconductor industry. The scheme aims to provide financial incentives to companies that manufacture semiconductors and other electronics components locally. Additionally, the government has identified building semiconductor fabs (fabrication plants) as a priority area under its National Policy on Electronics.</p>
