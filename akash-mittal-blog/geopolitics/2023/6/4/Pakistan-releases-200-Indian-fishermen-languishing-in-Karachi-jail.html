  <p>India and Pakistan have been having longstanding disputes which has resulted in a tense relation between the two countries. The issue of Indian fishermen being arrested in Pakistan and vice versa has been a recurring problem between the two nations. However, on December 28, 2020, Pakistan announced the release of 200 Indian fishermen, who were languishing in Karachi jails. This decision was taken by the government as a goodwill gesture in view of the upcoming birth anniversary of Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, and Christmas.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>Indian fishermen often end up in Pakistani jails as they cross the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) in search of a better catch. Similarly, Pakistani fishermen also end up in Indian jails. Since they are unable to pay the fines, they are detained for various periods, including several years. Some are released after diplomatic efforts by their respective governments, while others die in captivity.</p>
  <p>One such case is of an Indian fisherman, Uday, who was arrested in Pakistan and held there for eight years. After several diplomatic efforts, he was finally released in 2019 and he returned to his home in Gujarat. He shares his traumatic experience in Pakistani jails where he had to endure physical and emotional stress. Another fisherman, Umesh, spent four years in a Pakistani jail for allegedly violating maritime boundaries. His family members fought tirelessly for his release and finally, he was released and he returned to his hometown in Uttar Pradesh.</p>
  <p>The problem of fishermen often getting arrested on the high seas is not limited to just India and Pakistan. Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu also share a similar problem. In 2018, Sri Lanka released 19 Indian fishermen who were detained in the island nation for over eight months on charges of poaching in its territorial waters.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The release of Indian fishermen from Pakistani jails is a welcome development as it will bring joy to their families and loved ones back home. The humanitarian gesture by the Pakistani government is a step towards improving bilateral relations between the two countries. However, it is important that the two countries work towards finding a permanent solution to this problem, rather than just relying on such ad hoc arrangements, which can lead to further tensions.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, the release of 200 Indian fishermen by Pakistan is a positive step and should be appreciated by both countries. This humanitarian approach can go a long way in rebuilding trust and improving relations between India and Pakistan. It is important that both countries continue to work towards a permanent solution to the problem of fishermen being detained in each other's jails.</p>
