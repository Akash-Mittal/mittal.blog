  <p>India's standoff with China in 2020 was one of the most crucial moments in its foreign policy. It was a time when India demonstrated its strength as a global power, which has the ability to deter rivals. The conflict occurred in an area where India had been developing infrastructure to push its border with China further eastwards. But, China had been laying claim to that very region. The conflict was sparked when Chinese troops violated India's sovereignty by intruding into its territory. But India stood its ground and did not let China get away with its salami tactics of trying to alter the status quo by incremental steps. Here are some examples of how India managed to deter China:</p>
  <h2>Examples of India's Deterrence</h2>
  <h3>The Galwan Valley Flare-Up</h3>
  <p>The Galwan valley flare-up was one of the most significant clashes between Indian and Chinese troops in the Ladakh region. It resulted in casualties on both sides. But, India made it clear that any attack on its troops would be met with equal force. Indian soldiers not only managed to inflict heavy casualties on Chinese forces but also took control of strategic heights in the region. This move caught China off guard and forced it to rethink its strategy. The incident was a clear display of India's military prowess and its ability to defend its territorial integrity.</p>
  <h3>The Economic Boycott</h3>
  <p>India also hit China where it hurt the most: Its economy. The Indian government banned scores of Chinese apps and called for a boycott of Chinese goods, which was taken up by the public. This move had a ripple effect on China's economy as India is one of its biggest trading partners. The Indian government also tightened its investment rules, making it harder for Chinese firms to invest in India. This move was a clear message to China that India was not afraid to use economic means to counter its aggression.</p>
  <h3>Diplomatic Isolation</h3>
  <p>India managed to garner support from global powers such as the US, Japan, and Australia during its standoff with China. These countries condemned China's aggression and supported India's right to defend its territorial integrity. India also used its diplomatic channels to isolate China in international forums such as the UN. This move made China realize that it cannot act with impunity and that the world is watching its actions.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>India's deterrence of China in 2020 was a proud achievement for the country. India demonstrated its strength as a global power and its determination to defend its territorial integrity. India used a combination of military, economic, and diplomatic means to counter China's aggression, which sent a clear message that India cannot be trifled with. This incident has put India on the map as a regional power that can stand up to mighty adversaries like China.</p>
