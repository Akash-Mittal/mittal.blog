    <p>In March 2021, Indian Air Force Chief RKS Bhadauria made a surprising statement. He revealed that the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) had deployed its fighter jets close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the de facto border between China and India. The Indian Air Force promptly responded by deploying its own fighter jets to the area.</p>
    <p>This incident was just the latest in a series of developments that had been playing out along the India-China border over the past year. China had been building up its military force in the region, with a particular focus on air capabilities. As tensions between the two countries continued to simmer, experts began to warn that a major conflict could break out at any moment.</p>

    <h2>Examples with Case Studies</h2>
    <p>China's military buildup along the India-China border has been going on for months. The country moved troops, artillery, tanks, and other equipment to the border region in the summer of 2020, ostensibly for military exercises. However, these troops never left the area and instead set up permanent positions.</p>
    <p>By the fall of 2020, India had become increasingly concerned about China's military buildup along the LAC. The country responded by deploying tens of thousands of its own troops to the area, along with tanks, artillery, and other military equipment. The situation quickly escalated, with both sides accusing each other of violating the LAC and engaging in provocative actions.</p>
    <p>In February 2021, tensions between China and India reached a critical point. A clash between Chinese and Indian soldiers resulted in the deaths of at least 20 Indian soldiers and an unknown number of Chinese soldiers. This was the first time in several decades that such a deadly confrontation had taken place between the two countries.</p>
    <p>Throughout this period of buildup and tension, one particular aspect of China's military capabilities has stood out: its air force. China had been deploying its fighter jets, bombers, and other aircraft to airports close to the LAC, giving it the ability to conduct quick and devastating air strikes on Indian positions if necessary.</p>

     <li>China's military buildup along the India-China border is primarily focused on air capabilities. The country has been deploying fighter jets, bombers, and other aircraft to airports close to the LAC, giving it the ability to conduct quick and devastating air strikes on Indian positions if necessary.</li>
     <li>The risks and threats posed by China's military buildup are significant. A major conflict between China and India could result in a devastating war with far-reaching consequences, not just for the two countries but for the entire region.</li>
     <li>India must take steps to counter China's military buildup and ensure its own security. This could include building up its own air capabilities, deploying additional troops and equipment to the border region, and engaging in diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions with China.</li>
