  <h1>Russia China seek world power rebalancing with G7 alternative indispensable mechanism</h1> <img src="images/Russia-China-seek-world-power-rebalancing-with-G7-alternative-indispensable-mechanism.jpeg" alt="+Russia-China-seek-world-power-rebalancing-with-G7-alternative-indispensable-mechanism+">
  <p>Once upon a time, the world was dominated by the Group of Seven (G7) nations, comprising of US, Canada, UK, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. They were the undisputed leaders of the global economy. However, in recent years, their dominance has been challenged by rising powers like China and Russia. These countries have now joined forces to create an alternative mechanism to the G7, which they see as outdated and inadequate for the modern world.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Russia China collaboration</h2>
  <p>One of the most significant examples of Russia China collaboration is the creation of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in 2001. The SCO is a regional security bloc comprising of China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. It was initially formed to counter threats posed by terrorist organisations such as Al-Qaeda, but has since expanded its scope to include economic and cultural cooperation as well.</p>
  <p>Another example of Russia China collaboration is the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal. The US, along with G7 partners, negotiated and signed the deal with Iran in 2015 to limit the latter's nuclear programme. However, in 2018, the US unilaterally withdrew from the deal, citing concerns over Iran's compliance. China and Russia, along with the other signatories of the deal, have continued to support it and have criticised the US for its withdrawal.</p>
  <h2>Case studies: China's Belt and Road Initiative and Russia's Eurasian Economic Union</h2>
  <p>China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects in history. It aims to connect Asia, Europe, Africa and the Middle East through a network of railways, highways, ports and other infrastructure. The BRI has been criticised by some as a means of expanding Chinese influence and creating debt traps for participating countries. However, China has defended the BRI as a way to promote economic development and connectivity.</p>
  <p>Russia's Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) is a regional economic bloc comprising of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. The EAEU aims to promote economic integration between its member states through free trade, a common market and a single customs union. The EAEU has been criticised by some as a means of Russia asserting its dominance over its neighbours. However, Russia has defended the EAEU as a way to promote economic growth and stability in the region.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>There is no doubt that the world is changing, and the balance of power is shifting. The G7, which was once the undisputed leader of the global economy, is now struggling to maintain its relevance in a world of rising powers such as China and Russia. These countries have joined forces to create an alternative mechanism to the G7, which they see as outdated and ineffective.</p>
  <p>China and Russia have collaborated on various initiatives, from regional security to economic integration. While some of these initiatives have been criticised, both countries have defended them as a way to promote development and connectivity.</p>
  <p>The emergence of the China-Russia partnership is a clear sign that the world is moving towards a multipolar order, where no single country or group of countries can assert dominance. This new world order will require a new approach to global governance, one that is inclusive, collaborative and equitable.</p>
