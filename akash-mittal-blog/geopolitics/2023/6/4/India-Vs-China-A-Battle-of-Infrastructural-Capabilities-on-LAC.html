  <h1>India Vs China: A Battle of Infrastructural Capabilities on LAC</h1> <img src="images/India-Vs-China-A-Battle-of-Infrastructural-Capabilities-on-LAC.jpeg" alt="+India-Vs-China-A-Battle-of-Infrastructural-Capabilities-on-LAC+">
  <p></p>
  <p>As the recent standoff between India and China continues along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), concerns have been growing regarding the infrastructure capabilities of both nations. While China has a well-developed and established infrastructure, India has been slowly but steadily catching up with its neighbour. Let us explore India's progress towards matching up to China's infrastructural capabilities on the LAC.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Interesting Story:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In 2017, China opened the world's highest bridge, the Beipanjiang Bridge, which stands at a height of 1,854 feet above a river bed. This feat put China on the map as a nation that prioritizes infrastructure development. However, India too has undertaken some impressive infrastructural projects, especially in the mountainous terrain.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. NH-1, India's Only Road into Ladakh:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The National Highway 1 (NH-1) serves as the only road access to Ladakh, connecting it to the rest of the country. In recent years, India has undertaken substantial improvements to this road, with widening of the road and the construction of tunnels. These tunnels have not only reduced travel time but have also provided a safer route in dangerous weather conditions.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. BRO's Strategic Roads:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The Border Roads Organization (BRO) has been tasked with improving road connectivity in the border regions. In recent years, the BRO has constructed numerous strategic roads, each serving a different purpose. The Darcha- Padum - Nimu road in Ladakh ensures that the region remains accessible year-round. Similarly, the Rishikesh-Dharasu road ensures connectivity to the border regions and minimizes travel time.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case Studies:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Atal Tunnel:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Recently inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Atal Tunnel is the world's longest highway tunnel built at an altitude of 10,000 feet. The tunnel connects Manali to Leh, providing all-weather connectivity to the region. The construction of the tunnel also involved a significant skill transfer to the BRO personnel, making them capable of undertaking such large projects.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Project Hirak:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Project Hirak was launched by the Ministry of Defence, aimed at developing infrastructure for the Indian Army along the LAC. The project includes the construction of 29 strategically vital roads in the border regions, which will boost the movement of troops and supplies.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Over the years, India has made significant progress in improving its infrastructure capabilities in the border regions. Projects like the Atal Tunnel and Project Hirak demonstrate India's commitment to matching up to China's infrastructural capabilities on the LAC. The need for rapid infrastructural development in the region has also seen a significant investment of resources towards improving road connectivity and transportation facilities. With India's steady progress, it won't be long before India matches up to China's infrastructural capabilities in the region.</p>
