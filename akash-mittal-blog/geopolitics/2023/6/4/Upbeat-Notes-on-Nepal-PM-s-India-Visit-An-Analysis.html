   <p>The recent visit of Nepal's Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli to India has been a topic of much discussion in both the countries' media and political circles. The visit was seen as an opportunity to strengthen the relationship between the two countries, which has been somewhat strained in recent years due to various political and economic issues.</p>
   <h2>The Positive Side</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>During the visit, several agreements were signed by the two sides, including a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the construction of a railway line between Raxaul in India and Kathmandu in Nepal. This is expected to boost trade and connectivity between the two countries.</li>
    <li>The two sides also agreed to work on a project to build a cross-border petroleum pipeline from India to Nepal. This will not only help in meeting Nepal's increasing demand for petroleum products but also make the supply chain more efficient and cost-effective.</li>
    <li>Another highlight of the visit was the commitment made by India to increase its electricity supply to Nepal. This is an important issue for Nepal, which faces severe power shortages on a regular basis.</li>
    <li>Both sides also agreed to launch a new bus service between Janakpur and Ayodhya, connecting two important pilgrimage sites for Hindus in the two countries.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>The Negative Side</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>However, the visit was not without its controversies. One of the main issues raised by the Nepalese side was the alleged obstruction by India of the implementation of the Mahakali Treaty, which governs the sharing of resources from the Mahakali River between the two countries.</li>
    <li>Another issue that has been a bone of contention between the two countries is India's blockade of Nepal's border in 2015, which severely affected Nepal's economy and caused much hardship to its people.</li>
    <li>There is also a sense among some in Nepal that India has been interfering in its internal affairs. This has led to calls for greater self-reliance and the search for other partners, such as China.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>Overall, the visit of Nepal's Prime Minister to India can be seen as a positive development in the relationship between the two countries. The signing of agreements and the announcement of new initiatives are important steps in improving trade and connectivity between the two countries, which will benefit both sides.</p>
   <p>However, there are still some unresolved issues that need to be addressed, such as India's alleged obstruction of the Mahakali Treaty and the issue of interference in Nepal's internal affairs. It is important for both sides to engage in meaningful dialogue and find mutually acceptable solutions to these problems.</p>
   <p>At the same time, Nepal should also continue to explore other avenues of cooperation, such as with China and other countries in the region. This will not only help in diversifying its sources of aid and investment but also give it more negotiating power in its dealings with India.</p>
