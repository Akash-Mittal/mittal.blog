   <h3>India and China Spar Over Expulsion of Journalists As Visa Row Heats Up</h3>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>In the recent India-China visa row, media has become a battleground for the two Asian giants. The expulsion of journalists from both sides has escalated the tension between the two countries, adding another layer to their already complex relationship. While the media practitioners are caught in the crossfire, the impact of politics on media cannot be overlooked in this scenario.</p>
   <p>China has expelled three Indian journalists who were working for two leading Indian publications, The Hindu and The Times of India. The move comes after India expelling two Chinese journalists in the previous month, citing "activities beyond their journalistic capacity". The tit-for-tat action has put the spotlight on the fragile relationship between the two countries, which has been marred by several issues, including the border dispute, trade deficit, and regional influence.</p><img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/01/china-india-759.jpg" alt="India-China Border">
   <p>The media, however, has always played a significant role in shaping the narrative of both countries' relationship. It has been instrumental in highlighting the sensitive issues that often go unnoticed in the official statements of the governments. However, the same media has often been used as a pawn by the respective governments to push their agendas and silence the dissenting voices.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Politics Influencing Media Coverage</h2>
   <p>The India-China visa row is not the first time that politics has influenced media coverage in the two countries. Here are some notable examples:</p>
   <h3>The Doklam Standoff</h3>
   <p>The Doklam standoff between India and China in 2017 was a major point of contention between the two countries. While the media in both countries covered the event extensively, the tone and tenor of the coverage were vastly different. Indian media portrayed the standoff as a resolute response to China's aggression, while the Chinese media projected it as India's attempt to meddle in the Chinese territory. The media channels in both countries were selective in their coverage, culling out the news that suited their respective governments' line of thought.</p>
   <h3>The Galwan Valley Clash</h3>
   <p>The clash between Indian and Chinese soldiers in the Galwan Valley in June 2020 was another instance where the media was used to shape public opinion. While the Indian media projected it as a valiant sacrifice by the Indian soldiers to defend their motherland, the Chinese media dubbed it as India's unsuccessful attempt to trespass the Chinese territory. Both countries tried to pin the blame on each other and vouched for their version of the story. The media coverage in both countries mirrored their respective governments' stance on the issue.</p>
   <h2>Impact of Politics on Media</h2>
   <p>The media's role is to inform the public and facilitate meaningful conversations about the critical issues facing the society. However, when politics creep in, the media becomes less of an informative conduit and more of a propaganda tool. The narrow-mindness of politics affects the media's ability to ask the right questions, get the right answers, and offer unbiased analysis. Here are some ways in which politics impacts media:</p>
   <h3>Censorship</h3>
   <p>One of the most direct impacts of politics on media is censorship. The governments often use their power to suppress the stories that go against their interests or highlight their shortcomings. Several media outlets in China are directly controlled by the government, which ensures that they toe the line of the Communist Party of China. The Indian media, on the other hand, enjoys relative freedom, but it is not immune to censorship either. Several laws like the Official Secrets Act, Section 124A (Sedition), and Section 66A of the IT Act provide the government with the legal tools to silence the voices that dissent or criticize the government.</p>
   <h3>Sensationalism</h3>
   <p>Politics often forces the media to focus on sensationalism rather than substance. In the quest for higher TRPs and increased readership, media outlets often resort to clickbait headlines, sensationalized reporting, and half-baked analysis. The readers are fed a steady diet of sensationalism rather than nuanced discussion, leading to a superficial understanding of the issues.</p>
   <h3>Cherry-picking</h3>
   <p>Politics also influences the media's choice of stories. The media outlets often cherry-pick the issues that they want to cover or ignore. The media may choose to devote extensive coverage to minor stories that fit their political agenda while ignoring significant stories that could hold the government accountable. The deliberate selection of stories skews the public perception and hinders the media's credibility.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The India-China visa row is a classic example of how politics can impact media coverage and how the media can become a casualty in the crossfire. The media's role is to inform the people about the ongoings of the society, but it can only play its role if it is free from political coercion and able to report the facts without any bias. To ensure that the media remains an independent and free entity, it is necessary to keep the politics out of the editorial room and let the journalists do their job without any fear or favor.</p>
