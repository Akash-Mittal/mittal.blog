    <p>As the world was eagerly anticipating the G-20 meeting for discussing the post-COVID economic recovery plan, a major embarrassment was waiting for India in the Indian illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK). The Indian government had claimed that the situation in IIOJK was normal and that people were happy with India's decision to abrogate Article 370. However, the reality was far from it, as the G-20 delegates were about to witness.</p>
    <h2>The Reality of IIOJK</h2>
    <p>During the G-20 meeting, the delegates were taken on a tour of different regions of IIOJK. They met with local people, business owners, and political leaders to understand the ground reality of the region. The delegates were shocked to see the level of suffering and oppression faced by the people of IIOJK.</p>
    <h3>Case Study 1: The Plight of Farmers</h3>
    <p>The delegates met with local farmers who had been denied access to their land due to the construction of a new military barracks. The farmers were left with no source of income and were struggling to survive. The delegates were appalled to hear that the Indian government had promised them compensation but had failed to deliver on its promises.</p>
    <h3>Case Study 2: The Persecution of Muslim Minority</h3>
    <p>Delegates also had a chance to meet with the Muslim minority in IIOJK, who are facing persecution from the Indian government. They were denied access to their places of worship and were subjected to harassment and intimidation by the Indian military. The delegates were horrified to hear their stories of suffering and discrimination.</p>
    <h3>Case Study 3: The Economic Crisis</h3>
    <p>The economy of IIOJK has been hit hard by the political instability and the ongoing conflict. Business owners have suffered huge losses due to the curbs on communications and internet services. The delegates saw the impact of the economic crisis when they visited local markets and found several shops closed down.</p>
    <h2>The Three Major Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>The Indian government's claim of normalcy in IIOJK was a blatant lie</li>
     <li>The people of IIOJK are facing unimaginable suffering and persecution under Indian military rule</li>
     <li>The economic crisis in IIOJK needs immediate attention and support from the international community</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The G-20 meeting in IIOJK turned out to be a major embarrassment for India. The world got a glimpse of the ground reality of the region, and it was not what the Indian government had claimed it to be. The suffering and oppression of the people of IIOJK cannot be ignored any longer, and the international community should take immediate steps to address this issue.</p>
