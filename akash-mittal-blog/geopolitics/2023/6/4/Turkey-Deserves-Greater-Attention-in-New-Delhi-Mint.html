    <h1>Turkey Deserves Greater Attention in New Delhi Mint</h1> <img src="images/Turkey-Deserves-Greater-Attention-in-New-Delhi-Mint.jpeg" alt="+Turkey-Deserves-Greater-Attention-in-New-Delhi-Mint+">
    <p>Turkey and India are two countries with a long history and rich culture. Despite having established diplomatic relations back in the 1950s, the bilateral trade between the two nations has not been as significant as one might expect. While the reasons behind this lack of economic cooperation are multifaceted, the potential for growth and collaboration appears to be promising, particularly for Turkish interests in India. In this article, we will explore why Turkey deserves greater attention in New Delhi Mint and the opportunities presented for collaboration in the areas of investments, trade relations, and tourism.</p>
    <h2>Investments</h2>
    <p>One of the most significant factors that could increase Turkey's presence in New Delhi Mint is the investment opportunities in both countries. Turkey is an attractive destination for Indian investors due to its strategic location, access to markets, and lower cost of doing business. Similarly, Turkey is interested in investing in India, particularly in infrastructure, defense, and information technology.</p>
    <div class="case-study">
     <h4>Case Study: Turkish Investments in India</h4>
     <p>While Turkish investment in India has been relatively low, there have been some successful ventures. One example is the acquisition of Mumbai-based Silkroad Sugar Private Ltd. by Turkey's Kayyum Investment and Trade Pvt. Ltd. in 2019. The deal was valued at around $250 million and is considered Turkey's largest single investment in India to date.</p>
     <p>In addition to this, there have also been partnerships between Turkish and Indian companies in various sectors, such as energy, real estate, and textiles.</p>

    </div>
    <h2>Trade Relations</h2>
    <p>In addition to investments, trade relations between Turkey and India have significant potential to grow. Turkey is a member of the Customs Union with the European Union and has free-trade agreements with several countries, making it an attractive destination for Indian businesses. Furthermore, Turkey's location provides easy access to markets in Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia. Collaboration between Turkish and Indian businesses can lead to an increase in bilateral trade volume and further economic integration between the two countries.</p>
    <div class="case-study">
     <h4>Case Study: Turkish Exports to India</h4>
     <p>According to the Ambassador of Turkey to India, Sakir Ozkan Torunlar, Turkey's exports to India have been on the rise in recent years, reaching $8.6 billion in 2019. The two countries have set a target of $10 billion in trade volume by 2020, and it appears that they are on track to achieve this goal. Turkey mainly exports machinery, textiles, and chemicals to India, and there is significant room for diversification in the export basket.</p>

    </div>
    <h2>Tourism</h2>
    <p>Turkey is a popular tourist destination for Indians due to its rich cultural heritage and historical landmarks. According to the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism, more than 198,000 Indian tourists visited Turkey in 2019, up by 57% from the previous year. However, there is still significant room for growth in the tourism sector, particularly with increased promotion of Turkish culture and heritage in India.</p>
    <div class="case-study">
     <h4>Case Study: Indian Visitors to Turkey</h4>
     <p>Some of the reasons behind the growth in Indian tourism to Turkey include the e-visa facility, direct flights, and promotional activities carried out by Turkish Airlines and the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism in India. In addition, Turkish Airlines operates a daily direct flight between Istanbul and Mumbai, increasing connectivity between the two nations.</p>

     <h3>Conclusion</h3>
     <p>Turkey and India share many similarities and have a long history of cultural and diplomatic relations. However, the economic cooperation between the two nations has not been as strong as expected. Given the potential for growth and collaboration in areas such as investments, trade relations, and tourism, Turkey deserves greater attention in New Delhi Mint. In conclusion, the following are three key takeaways for Indian businesses and policymakers:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>Increasing investments from both sides can lead to synergies and mutual benefits.</li>
      <li>Efforts for diversification in the export portfolio and increased trade volume between the two nations can foster economic integration.</li>
      <li>Increased promotion of Turkish culture and heritage in India can lead to a growth in tourism and strengthen the people-to-people contacts.</li>
     </ol>
