    <p>Once upon a time, there was a group of five countries - Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) - that came together to form a powerful global alliance. They recognized the importance of working together to promote growth, development, and prosperity in their respective countries, as well as in other regions of the world.</p>
    <p>However, they soon realized that their impact on the global stage was limited due to the dominance of Western powers in key international organizations such as the United Nations, World Bank, and International Monetary Fund. This led to a growing call for reform of the global decision-making system, with India and Russia taking a lead in demanding a bigger voice for emerging economies like themselves.</p>

    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <h3>India's Struggle for UN Security Council Seat</h3>
    <p>India has long been seeking a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, but the country's efforts have been thwarted by the reluctance of the existing permanent members (USA, UK, France, China, and Russia) to expand the Council's membership. India argues that as the world's second-most populous country and as a major global economic power, it deserves a greater say in shaping global security policies. It has received support from countries like Russia, China, and Brazil, which are also seeking a reform of the UN system.</p>
    <h3>Russia's Bid for More Influence in Global Affairs</h3>
    <p>Russia has been pushing for a greater role in global decision-making, particularly in the economic and financial spheres. The country has taken steps to reduce its reliance on the US dollar as a reserve currency and has sought to increase its collaboration with other emerging economies like China and India. Russia has also been a strong advocate for reform of the IMF and the World Bank, arguing that these institutions have been dominated by developed countries and have failed to adequately represent the interests of emerging economies.</p>
    <h3>BRICS New Development Bank</h3>
    <p>In 2014, BRICS countries established the New Development Bank (NDB), a multilateral financial institution that would provide support for infrastructure and sustainable development projects in emerging economies. The bank was seen as an alternative to the IMF and World Bank, which were criticized for their bias towards developed countries. India and Russia are among the founding members of the NDB, which has since become a major player in global development finance.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The demand for a bigger voice for emerging economies like India and Russia in global decision-making has been growing in recent years. These countries have argued that the existing international institutions are dominated by Western powers and have failed to adequately represent the interests of developing countries. Through initiatives like the NDB and their push for UN Security Council reform, India and Russia are seeking to create a more equitable global system that reflects the realities of the 21st century.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, it is crucial for the global community to take note of the calls for reform by India and Russia. The world is changing rapidly, and the existing systems of global governance must adapt to keep up with these changes. By giving greater voice and influence to emerging economies, we can create a more just and sustainable global system that works for everyone.</p>
