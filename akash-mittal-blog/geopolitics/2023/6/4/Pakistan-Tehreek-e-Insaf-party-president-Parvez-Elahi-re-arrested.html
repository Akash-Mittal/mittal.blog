   <p>Pakistan Tehreek e Insaf (PTI) party president Parvez Elahi was re-arrested on Monday, a week after his release on bail. He was arrested in a case related to the 2002 fake accounts scam, which involves money laundering and corruption by politicians and businessmen.</p>
   <p>Elahi had been released on October 13 by the Lahore High Court on bail of Rs 10 million (approximately $65,000), after spending nearly a month in custody.</p>
   <p>The fake accounts scam came to light in 2018, when the State Bank of Pakistan flagged large transfers of money into several bank accounts. An investigation was launched, which revealed that these accounts had been opened in the names of poor people without their knowledge, and were being used to launder money.</p>
   <h2>Examples of fake accounts scams in other countries</h2>
   <p>The fake accounts scam is not unique to Pakistan. There have been several cases of similar scams in other countries as well.</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>India:</strong> In 2018, a fake accounts scam involving several banks in India was uncovered. It involved the use of shell companies to launder money and evade taxes. The scam was estimated to be worth Rs 14,000 crore (approximately $2 billion).</li>
    <li><strong>United States:</strong> In 2016, Wells Fargo, one of the largest banks in the US, was found to have opened millions of fake accounts in the names of its customers without their knowledge or consent. The bank was fined $185 million for its role in the scam.</li>
    <li><strong>Nigeria:</strong> In 2018, the Central Bank of Nigeria revoked the licenses of four banks over their involvement in a money laundering scandal. The banks had been accused of facilitating the transfer of $2.5 billion illegally out of the country.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>What does the re-arrest of Parvez Elahi mean for PTI?</h2>
   <p>The re-arrest of Parvez Elahi is a setback for the PTI, which has been trying to portray itself as a corruption-free alternative to the traditional political parties in Pakistan. The party came to power in 2018 on a platform of anti-corruption, promising to root out the deep-seated corruption that is endemic in Pakistan's political system.</p>
   <p>However, the party has been criticized for its inability to bring corrupt politicians and businessmen to justice. The re-arrest of Elahi is likely to further damage the party's credibility and reputation as a corruption-free alternative.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The re-arrest of Parvez Elahi in the fake accounts scam case is a reminder that corruption remains a serious problem in Pakistan's political system. While the PTI government has taken some steps to tackle corruption, it is clear that much more needs to be done in order to root out this scourge from Pakistani society.</p>
   <p>The re-arrest of Elahi is also a warning to other politicians and businessmen that they will not be able to escape justice forever. The law will eventually catch up with them, and they will be held accountable for their crimes.</p>
