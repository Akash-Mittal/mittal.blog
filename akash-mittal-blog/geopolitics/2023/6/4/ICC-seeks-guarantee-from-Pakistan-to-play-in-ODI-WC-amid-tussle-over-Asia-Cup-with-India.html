   <p>The International Cricket Council (ICC) has asked Pakistan to provide a guarantee that they will participate in the upcoming One Day International (ODI) World Cup, regardless of the ongoing dispute over their participation in the Asia Cup with India. According to reports, Pakistan had earlier refused to participate in the Asia Cup, which is scheduled to take place in September, citing security concerns about the tournament being held in India.</p>
   <p>This is not the first time that a cricketing event has been affected by political disagreements between India and Pakistan. In fact, cricket has often been caught in the crossfire between the two nations, who have a long history of political and military tensions. One of the most prominent examples of this was the cancellation of the 2016 World Twenty20 match between the two sides due to similar security concerns.</p>
   <p>The ICC has taken a tough stance on the issue, stating that it expects all participating nations to cooperate and fulfill their commitments to international cricket. This includes taking part in major events like the ODI World Cup, which is scheduled to take place in June 2019 in England and Wales. Failure to do so could result in severe penalties, including suspension from future ICC events or even expulsion from the international cricketing community.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <h3>The 2011 World Cup semi-final</h3>
   <p>One of the most famous cricketing encounters between India and Pakistan was the 2011 World Cup semi-final, which was held in Mohali, India. The match was highly anticipated, with both nations eager to come out on top. In the end, India emerged victorious, much to the disappointment of Pakistan cricket fans all over the world.</p>
   <p>However, what is often forgotten is the fact that the match was not without controversy. The Pakistani team was reportedly delayed for over an hour at the border between India and Pakistan, with officials from both sides squabbling over security arrangements. These delays meant that the Pakistani team arrived at the stadium much later than expected, leaving them with little time to warm up and prepare for the match.</p>
   <h3>The 2008 Mumbai attacks</h3>
   <p>The 2008 Mumbai attacks were another example of how politics can impact cricketing events. The terrorists responsible for the attacks were believed to have been trained and funded by Pakistani militants, leading to a major diplomatic fallout between India and Pakistan. This fallout spilled over into cricket, with the Indian government deciding to postpone the Indian Premier League (IPL) and other cricketing events involving Pakistani players.</p>
   <h3>The 2003 World Cup</h3>
   <p>The 2003 World Cup match between India and Pakistan is often regarded as one of the most passionate cricketing contests between the two nations. The match was held in Centurion, South Africa, and was considered a watershed moment for cricket in both nations.</p>
   <p>However, controversy erupted when the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) accused Indian players of match-fixing, leading to an emergency meeting between the PCB and ICC officials. The allegations were later dismissed, but the incident once again highlighted the fragile nature of cricketing relations between India and Pakistan.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The ongoing dispute over the Asia Cup between India and Pakistan is just the latest example of how politics can interfere with cricket. With the ICC now seeking a guarantee from Pakistan that they will participate in the ODI World Cup, it is clear that cricket administrators are keen to avoid a repeat of previous incidents where politics has had a detrimental effect on the game.</p>
   <p>It is important for all stakeholders in the game to remember that cricket is a sport that has the power to unite rather than divide. While political disagreements will inevitably arise, it is important to keep them separate from the game and to allow cricket to thrive as it should.</p>
