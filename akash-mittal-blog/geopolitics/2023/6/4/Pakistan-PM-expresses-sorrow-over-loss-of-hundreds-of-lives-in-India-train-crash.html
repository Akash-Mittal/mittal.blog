   <p>It was a sunny day in 2002 when the Samjhauta Express, a train that ran between India and Pakistan, was at its usual pace when it was interrupted by a loud explosion. A bomb had been planted on the train, killing 68 passengers and injuring many others. The incident shook the two countries and brought tears to the eyes of countless families.</p>
   <p>Fast forward to 2021, and we have once again witnessed a train tragedy that has taken the lives of over 100 people in India's Maharashtra state. The incident has left the entire nation in shock and disbelief.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <p>Train accidents are not new, but the scale of the recent tragedy in India has highlighted the need for urgent action to be taken to improve safety measures on trains. Let's take a look at some case studies of train accidents around the world:</p>
   <h3>Spain (2013)</h3>
   <p>A high-speed train in Spain derailed at a sharp bend, killing 79 passengers and injuring over 100. The accident was caused due to the excess speed of the train, which was traveling at 190 km/h in an area that had a maximum speed limit of 80 km/h.</p>
   <h3>South Africa (2019)</h3>
   <p>A train crash in South Africa killed four people and injured more than 300. The accident was caused by the train driver, who had ignored a stop signal and collided with another train on the same track.</p>
   <h3>USA (2015)</h3>
   <p>A train carrying more than 200 passengers derailed in Philadelphia, killing eight people and injuring over 200. The derailment was caused by the driver who had lost control of the train while traveling at more than double the speed limit on a sharp curve.</p>
   <h2>What can be done?</h2>
   <p>Train accidents are devastating, and the loss of innocent lives is unacceptable. Here are some steps that can be taken to minimise the risk of train accidents:</p>
   <h3>Investment in infrastructure</h3>
   <p>A modern-day railway infrastructure is key to ensuring safety on trains. Investing in the upgradation of railway tracks, signalling systems and other equipment will help reduce the chances of accidents caused by technical failures.</p>
   <h3>Training &amp; Guidelines</h3>
   <p>Proper training must be provided to the train drivers to understand and implement the guidelines correctly during travel. The drivers should be well rested, and their working hours should be regulated to avoid fatigue-related incidents.</p>
   <h3>Safety Measures</h3>
   <p>The safety measures on trains must be improved, including the emergency brakes, fire protection equipment, and other safety mechanisms that can help prevent accidents or minimise the damage caused by them.</p>
