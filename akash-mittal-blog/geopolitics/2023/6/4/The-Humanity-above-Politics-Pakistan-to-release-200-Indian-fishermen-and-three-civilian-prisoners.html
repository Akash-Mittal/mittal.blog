  <h1>The Humanity above Politics - Pakistan to release 200 Indian fishermen and three civilian prisoners</h1> <img src="images/The-Humanity-above-Politics-Pakistan-to-release-200-Indian-fishermen-and-three-civilian-prisoners.jpeg" alt="+The-Humanity-above-Politics-Pakistan-to-release-200-Indian-fishermen-and-three-civilian-prisoners+">
  <p>A remarkable story came out of Pakistani government last week. The authorities have taken a commendable step by announcing the release of around 200 Indian fishermen and three civilian prisoners. This gesture is a clear indication of the policy of humanity above politics.</p>
  <p>The relations between India and Pakistan have not been cordial since independence in 1947. The two countries fought three major wars, and the increased tensions have resulted in the additional security measures and restricted movement across borders.</p>
  <p>Although the tensions between the two nations are high, there are always some incidents that bring hope for betterment. This release of prisoners by Pakistan is undoubtedly one of them, bringing in much-needed human touch between the two nations.</p>
  <h2>Example of the benefits of such humanitarian moves</h2>
  <p>The release of prisoners of one country by another is not a rare occurrence; it has been seen from time to time in history. The humanitarian exchange of prisoners helps to build trust and creates a suitable environment for better relations. In November 2018, Pakistan released an Indian Air Force pilot, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, after his aircraft was shot down over the Line of Control in Kashmir. This brave act by Pakistan was highly appreciated by Indian citizens, and it resulted in a calming effect on the heightened tension between the two countries.</p>
  <p>The release of prisoners has been the topic of various negotiations and peace agreements. The exchange of prisoners provides a chance for nations to build relationships based on trust and mutual respect, and it can lead to further dialogues, reducing tensions and creating new opportunities for cooperation.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies in the influence of humane gestures on Peace</h2>
  <p>The power of humane gestures cannot be underestimated, and it has been proven multiple times in history. The example of the United States and Cuba is a great example of how even small steps can lead to greater achievements. In 2014, President Obama announced an initiative to normalize relations between the United States and Cuba, and later that year, the two countries exchanged prisoners. Both nations took some significant steps in the direction of normalization, resulting in better trade relations, travel, and communication. What started as a small gesture turned into huge results, promoting negotiation instead of war.</p>
  <p>Another example comes from South Africa, where the release of political prisoners significantly changed the country's future. Nelson Mandela, a political prisoner, was released in 1990 after serving 27 years in prison for opposing the Apartheid regent. The release of political prisoners was a critical milestone in the downfall of the Apartheid regime in South Africa. After his release, Mandela was elected as the country's first black President, and the country had undergone a peaceful transition to democracy.</p>
  <h2>Benefits of this step to India</h2>
  <p>This move by Pakistan is a significant step towards peace and better relations. It indicates the willingness of Pakistan's government to create a peaceful environment and promote dialogue with India. The release of prisoners is not only humane, but it can also help India to create a conducive atmosphere for a healthy relationship with Pakistan.</p>
  <p>The step towards better relations between India and Pakistan can result in a constructive approach towards resolving all the issues in the future. The exchange of prisoners can help in promoting a better understanding of each other's perspective and create an environment that enables healthy cooperation between the two nations.</p>
  <h2>The Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The move by Pakistan's government undoubtedly deserves applause from both the nations. The release of prisoners provides an opportunity for both India and Pakistan to move forward towards a peaceful future. The step towards peace and humanity by Pakistan is not only good for the two countries, but it also sets an example for the entire world that it is always possible for nations to set aside their differences and work together towards better relationships and cooperation.</p>
