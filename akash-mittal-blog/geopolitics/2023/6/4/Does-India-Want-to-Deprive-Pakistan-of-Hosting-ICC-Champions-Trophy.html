  <h1>Does India Want to Deprive Pakistan of Hosting ICC Champions Trophy?</h1> <img src="images/Does-India-Want-to-Deprive-Pakistan-of-Hosting-ICC-Champions-Trophy.jpeg" alt="+Does-India-Want-to-Deprive-Pakistan-of-Hosting-ICC-Champions-Trophy+">
  <p>The India-Pakistan cricket rivalry is one of the most intense and passionate in the history of the sport. However, this rivalry has often spilled beyond the boundaries of the cricket field as the two countries have been embroiled in political tensions for decades. The recent controversy over the hosting of the ICC Champions Trophy is another example of this.</p>
  <p>In April 2021, the ICC announced that India will host the 2021 edition of the ICC Champions Trophy, which is scheduled to be held in October and November. However, this decision has not gone down well with Pakistan, as they feel that India is trying to deprive them of hosting the tournament.</p>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>India-Pakistan Relations:</strong> The India-Pakistan relationship has been strained for decades due to various political and territorial issues. The two countries have fought several wars and have had numerous border conflicts. This has spilled over to the cricket field as well, with several instances of aggression and hostility between the players and fans.</li>
   <li><strong>Controversy over Hosting:</strong> Pakistan has been lobbying for the hosting rights of the ICC Champions Trophy since the beginning of the year. They argued that they have the infrastructure and facilities to host a successful tournament and that they deserve a chance to do so. However, the ICC Board of Directors unanimously decided to award the hosting rights to India.</li>
   <li><strong>India's Reasoning:</strong> India's decision to host the ICC Champions Trophy is based on several factors, including the availability of world-class facilities and infrastructure, the country's status as a major cricketing nation, and the success of previous major cricket tournaments held in India. India is also looking to revive its economy, which has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, and hosting major sporting events is one way to achieve that.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>So, does India really want to deprive Pakistan of hosting the ICC Champions Trophy? The answer is not straightforward. While India's decision to host the tournament is based on valid reasons, there may be some political motives behind it as well. Pakistan and India have been engaged in a war of words and border tensions in recent times, and India may be using cricket as a means to assert its dominance over its neighbor.</p>
  <p>Moreover, Pakistan's concerns cannot be dismissed outright. The country has a rich cricketing history and has successfully hosted several major tournaments in the past, including the 1987 and 1996 World Cups. It also has world-class facilities and infrastructure, and denying it the opportunity to host the ICC Champions Trophy may be seen as unfair by many.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, the India-Pakistan cricket rivalry is one of the most passionate and intense in the world. While India's decision to host the ICC Champions Trophy is based on valid reasons such as having world-class facilities and infrastructure, it cannot be denied that there may be some political motives behind it as well. Pakistan's concerns cannot be dismissed outright, and denying it the opportunity to host the tournament may be seen as unfair by many.</p>
