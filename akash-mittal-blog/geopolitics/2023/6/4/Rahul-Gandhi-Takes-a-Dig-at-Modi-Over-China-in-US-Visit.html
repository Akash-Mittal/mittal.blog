  <h1>India Opposition Leader Rahul Gandhi Takes a Dig at Modi Over China in US Visit</h1> <img src="images/Rahul-Gandhi-Takes-a-Dig-at-Modi-Over-China-in-US-Visit.jpeg" alt="+Rahul-Gandhi-Takes-a-Dig-at-Modi-Over-China-in-US-Visit+">
  <p>When it comes to the relations between India and China, it has always been a sensitive topic. The recent tensions at the border have raised concerns among the Indian people. While the Indian government is taking steps to deal with the situation, the opposition leader Rahul Gandhi took the opportunity to take a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to the United States.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Rahul Gandhi's Criticism</h2>
  <p>During his visit, Rahul Gandhi criticized the Modi government's handling of the border issue and compared it to the United States' response to China's aggression.</p>
  <h3>Case study 1: 1962 China-India War</h3>
  <p>India and China have a history of conflicts. The most significant of these was the 1962 China-India War, wherein China gained control over Aksai Chin. The border dispute has remained unresolved ever since. The current tensions are reminiscent of the past, and Rahul Gandhi has questioned the government's response.</p>
  <h3>Case study 2: India and China's Trade Relations</h3>
  <p>India and China are among each other's biggest trading partners. In recent times, there has been a backlash against Chinese products, and the government has taken measures to reduce trade reliance on China. Rahul Gandhi has criticized the government for not doing enough to promote domestic manufacturing and industrial growth.</p>
  <h3>Case study 3: Galwan Valley Clash</h3>
  <p>The ongoing tensions between India and China intensified in June 2020 when a clash broke out between their armies in the Galwan Valley, resulting in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers. The Indian government has been criticized for not doing enough to prevent the clashes and for the lack of transparency in reporting the number of casualties. Rahul Gandhi has been vocal in his criticism of the government's approach to the situation.</p>
