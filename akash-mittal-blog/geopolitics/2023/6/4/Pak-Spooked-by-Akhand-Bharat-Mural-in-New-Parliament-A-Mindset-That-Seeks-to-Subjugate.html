  <h1>Pak Spooked by Akhand Bharat Mural in New Parliament – A Mindset That Seeks to Subjugate</h1> <img src="images/Pak-Spooked-by-Akhand-Bharat-Mural-in-New-Parliament-A-Mindset-That-Seeks-to-Subjugate.jpeg" alt="+Pak-Spooked-by-Akhand-Bharat-Mural-in-New-Parliament-A-Mindset-That-Seeks-to-Subjugate+">
  <p>Recently, the inclusion of an Akhand Bharat mural in the new Indian parliament has generated controversy. The mural depicts the undivided Indian subcontinent, including Pakistan, Bangladesh, and parts of Afghanistan. While this has been seen by some as a symbol of India's historical unity and cultural richness, others see it as a manifestation of a mindset that seeks to subjugate and dominate its neighboring nations.</p>
  <h2>The Historical Context</h2>
  <p>The idea of a united India, or Akhand Bharat, has been a recurrent theme in Indian historical narratives. It portrays the Indian subcontinent as a single cultural entity that has been divided and fragmented by foreign invasions and colonialism. The proponents of Akhand Bharat see the current borderlines as artificial and imposed by external forces, and advocate for the unification of all Indian territories under one political entity.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <h3>Case Study 1: The Annexation of Jammu and Kashmir</h3>
  <p>The annexation of Jammu and Kashmir by India is a clear example of how the Akhand Bharat ideology has been put into practice. Jammu and Kashmir was a princely state with a predominantly Muslim population, ruled by a Hindu maharaja. When India became independent from British rule, the maharaja acceded to India, in spite of the popular demand for joining Pakistan. This triggered a conflict between India and Pakistan, leading to three wars and ongoing violence in the region. India claims that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of the Indian union, while Pakistan and Kashmiri separatists demand independence or unification with Pakistan.</p>
  <h3>Case Study 2: The Citizenship Amendment Act</h3>
  <p>The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is another example of how the Akhand Bharat mindset seeks to subjugate and exclude certain communities. The CAA offers citizenship to non-Muslim minorities from neighboring countries, but excludes Muslim minorities, thus creating a religiously biased immigration policy. This has been criticized both inside and outside of India as discriminatory and contrary to the values of secularism and pluralism.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The controversy over the Akhand Bharat mural in the new Indian parliament reflects a deeper debate about the nature of Indian identity and its relationship with its neighbors. While India has a rich and diverse cultural heritage, the Akhand Bharat ideology, when taken to its extreme, can be seen as an attempt to impose a monocultural vision and to assert dominance over weaker nations. It is important to recognize the validity of diverse identities and to foster peaceful coexistence based on mutual respect and dialogue.</p>
