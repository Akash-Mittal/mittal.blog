    <p>In early 2021, the political party Move Forward gained popularity in Thailand with their progressive agenda and promises of change. However, with such promises come concerns about how their foreign policy will affect the country's relationship with the United States.</p>
    <p>As an example, Move Forward has expressed interest in strengthening ties with China, while also criticizing the US government's interference in Thai politics. This has led some to question whether the US will continue to have leverage in Thailand if Move Forward gains more power.</p>

    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>To better understand the potential impact of Move Forward's foreign policy, let's take a look at some case studies.</p>
    <h3>Case Study 1: The US-Cambodia Relationship</h3>
    <p>When Cambodia became more aligned with China in recent years, the US government lost much of its leverage in the country. As a result, the US has struggled to promote democracy and human rights in Cambodia, and has even threatened to cut aid due to concerns about political repression.</p>
    <p>If Move Forward strengthens ties with China, it could have a similar effect on the US-Thailand relationship. The US may lose the ability to promote its values in Thailand and could face difficulty in addressing issues like human rights abuses.</p>
    <h3>Case Study 2: The US-Philippines Relationship</h3>
    <p>The Philippines is another country where the US has struggled to maintain leverage due to its president's pivot toward China. President Duterte has been openly hostile to the US government and has aligned himself more closely with China.</p>
    <p>If Move Forward takes similar actions, it could challenge the US's strategic interests in Southeast Asia and make it harder for the US to project its power in the region.</p>
