   <p>It's no secret that India and Pakistan share a bitter relationship when it comes to cricket. The on-field rivalry between both the teams is nothing short of intense, but off the field, it's a different story altogether. The two countries have often faced political tensions that have spilled over into cricket. In the latest development, Team India has decided to not visit Pakistan for the upcoming Asia Cup 2023 and a former Pakistan pacer has come out in support of their decision.</p>
   <h2>The Background</h2>
   <p>India and Pakistan have not played a bilateral cricket series since 2012-13 due to political tensions. The two teams have only faced each other in ICC tournaments or the Asia Cup, which are always held in neutral venues. In 2019, the BCCI had refused to let India play in the Asia Cup in Pakistan, citing security concerns. The tournament was eventually played in the UAE.</p>
   <h2>The Decision</h2>
   <p>The Asia Cup 2023 is set to be held in Pakistan, but Team India has decided to not participate in the tournament. According to sources, the decision was taken due to "political tensions" between the two countries. The BCCI is yet to make an official statement on the matter.</p>
   <h2>The Support</h2>
   <p>Former Pakistan pacer Shoaib Akhtar has come out in support of India's decision. In a recent video, Akhtar stated that India has taken this decision in the interest of their players' safety. He also added that he would have done the same if he was in India's shoes. "Why should India play cricket in Pakistan when their Prime Minister has so much hatred against the country," he said. Akhtar also called on the two countries to separate sports from politics.</p>
   <h2>Examples</h2>
   <p>This is not the first time that cricket has been marred by political tensions between the two countries. In 2008, the Mumbai terror attacks led to India's decision to call off their tour of Pakistan. In 2016, the BCCI had refused to let the Indian cricket team play in the Asia Cup held in Bangladesh because of security concerns.</p>
   <p>However, cricket has also been a medium to bring the two nations together. The historic 2004 tour of Pakistan by the Indian cricket team is remembered fondly by cricket enthusiasts on both sides of the border.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The decision by Team India to not visit Pakistan for the Asia Cup 2023 is understandable considering the political tensions between the two countries. The safety of the players should always be the top priority and India has taken the right decision in this regards. What is needed is for both countries to compartmentalize sports and politics and not let one spill into the other. Cricket can be a powerful tool to unite people, and it's time for India and Pakistan to set aside their differences and focus on the game.</p>
