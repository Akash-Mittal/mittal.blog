  <p>Once upon a time, Pakistan relied on the US dollar for its international trade transactions. However, in recent years, the country's political and economic ties with the US have strained, pushing Pakistan to explore alternative options. In this search, Pakistan found a partner in China, its all-weather ally.</p>
  <p>China and Pakistan have strengthened their economic and political ties under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project. As part of this collaboration, Pakistan has now decided to switch to trading crude oil in Chinese currency, the yuan.</p>
  <p>Why is this move significant? Let's explore.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Pakistan's Switch to Yuan</h2>
  <p>The first transaction between Pakistan and China using yuan for crude oil was conducted in late 2019. Before this, Pakistan paid for its oil imports in US dollars or other international currencies, which caused a heavy toll on its foreign exchange reserves. By avoiding the US dollar, Pakistan can reduce its reliance on the US and diversify its foreign exchange reserves.</p>
  <p>Another example of this partnership can be seen in the construction of the Gwadar port. This deep-sea port is being developed by China on Pakistan's southwestern coast. It will provide China a secure sea route to the Persian Gulf and help it bypass the Strait of Malacca. The port is also a crucial link in the CPEC project, which is expected to provide China access to the Indian Ocean and Middle Eastern markets.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies of Pakistan's Trade of Crude Oil in Yuan</h2>
  <p>One of the biggest beneficiaries of Pakistan's switch to yuan is China's state-owned oil giant, the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). In 2017, CNPC purchased a 70% stake in Pakistan's largest oil refinery, the Parco Coastal Refinery. This acquisition was a strategic move to secure China's energy supplies and strengthen its foothold in Pakistan's oil industry. The refinery now plays a crucial role in processing crude oil imported from the Middle East to China via Pakistan.</p>
  <p>Pakistan's switch to yuan has also helped it in its own energy needs. The country is heavily reliant on imported crude oil, which accounts for almost 80% of its total oil consumption. By switching to yuan, Pakistan can now negotiate better pricing and payment terms with suppliers, as they no longer need to worry about the exchange rate fluctuations of the US dollar.</p>
