   <p>Once upon a time, China was the largest oil demand driver in the world, but according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), India is set to surpass China in this regard. This development is due to its expanding population, growing economy, and improving lifestyle. While China will still experience growth in oil consumption, India's growth rate is predicted to be faster.</p>
   <p>For instance, data from the IEA has shown that from 2013-2018, India's oil consumption increased by 14 percent, while China grew by 13 percent. The IEA predicts that this trend will continue, with India's oil consumption growing by 3.6 percent per year through 2024, compared with China's 2.1 percent.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Factors Driving India's Oil Demand</h2>
   <p>India's population is growing at a rate of 1.1 percent per year and is projected to reach 1.5 billion by 2030. As the population grows, so does the demand for oil to fuel transportation and electricity generation. Additionally, India's economy is growing at a faster rate than China's, with an average annual growth rate of over 7 percent for the past decade.</p>
   <p>The growing middle class in India is also a contributing factor to the increase in oil demand. As more Indians enter the middle class, they tend to purchase cars and other goods requiring transportation, which in turn leads to an increase in oil demand. According to a report by the Boston Consulting Group, India's middle class is expected to number around 540 million by 2025.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <p>A case study in India's oil demand can be seen in the country's thriving aviation industry. India is currently the world's fastest-growing aviation market, with passenger traffic increasing by around 20 percent annually. With over 600 aircraft on order currently, the aviation industry is set to significantly increase its oil consumption in the coming years.</p>
   <p>Another case study can be seen in India's push to electrify its transportation sector. According to the IEA, electric vehicle (EV) sales in India are set to increase by 22 percent annually through 2030. While EVs are expected to replace a significant portion of India's gasoline and diesel vehicles, the IEA still predicts an increase in overall oil demand due to continued economic growth and population growth.</p>
