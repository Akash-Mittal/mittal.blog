   <p>As Cyclone Biparjoy threatens India and Pakistan, let's dive into the fascinating world of how cyclones get their names.</p>
   
   <p>Did you know that the practice of naming cyclones started with an Australian weather forecaster named Clement Wragge in the late 19th century? Wragge began giving storms names after political figures he disliked, such as the "Maria" cyclone after Maria Ann Smith, who Wragge believed had stolen his apple varieties. The practice was eventually adopted by other meteorological agencies around the world, and today, it is done to help identify and track storms more easily.</p>
   <h2>Examples</h2>
   <p>Over the years, many naming systems have been developed for cyclones, depending on the region. In the Atlantic basin, storms are named from a predetermined list of names that alternate between male and female. For example, Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005, was on the list of predetermined names for that year.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile, in the western North Pacific and the South China Sea, naming follows a different pattern. Names are taken from a list of names submitted by different countries in the region, with the names alternating between male and female. If a cyclone causes extensive damage, its name is retired and replaced with another name starting with the same letter.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <p>The importance of naming storms was highlighted during the 2019-2020 cyclone season in Australia. The season saw the formation of three severe tropical cyclones, each of which caused widespread damage and even deaths. However, what was unique about this season was that each storm was given a personal name: Veronica, Trevor, and Blake. By using personal names, the storms were given a human touch, which helped to increase public awareness and preparedness.</p>
   <p>Another example is Cyclone Amphan, which struck India and Bangladesh in May 2020. The name "Amphan" was given by Thailand, and it means "sky" in the Thai language. The name was appropriate, as the storm caused extensive damage to the sky and the land beneath it.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, naming cyclones serves an important purpose in tracking, identifying, and preparing for storms. It also helps to increase public awareness and preparedness. Here are three key points to remember about how cyclones get their names:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The practice of naming storms started with an Australian weather forecaster in the late 19th century.</li>
    <li>Different regions have different naming systems for cyclones, with names chosen from predetermined lists or submitted by different countries.</li>
    <li>Naming storms helps to increase public awareness and preparedness, as well as track and identify storms more easily.</li>
   </ul>
