   <p>Have you ever wondered how your smartphone, laptop or electric car are made? One essential component required to manufacture these devices are rare earth minerals. Rare earths are a group of 17 elements found in the earth's crust, and despite their name, they are not actually rare. However, they are difficult to extract and process, which makes them valuable and in high demand.</p>
   <p>Rare earths have become a critical resource in today's modern society, used in a range of technologies from wind turbines and electric cars to medical devices and defense systems. Their importance has not gone unnoticed by the G20 countries, who collectively account for 75% of global rare earth production and consumption.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Rare Earth Minerals in Technology</h2>
   <p>To illustrate the importance of rare earths in technology, let's take a look at some examples:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Neodymium is used in the production of powerful magnets, which are found in wind turbines and electric motors.</li>
    <li>Europium is used to create the red phosphor in the screens of smartphones and televisions.</li>
    <li>Yttrium is used in the production of camera lenses, flat-panel displays, and LEDs.</li>
    <li>Lanthanum is used in rechargeable batteries for hybrid and electric cars.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <p>Let's take a closer look at some case studies of rare earth use in technology:</p>
   <h3>Electric Vehicles in China</h3>
   <p>China is the world's largest producer of rare earths, and they have been using this advantage to drive the development of electric vehicles. Rare earths are used in the manufacture of batteries and the magnets needed for electric drives. China has set a goal to produce at least 2 million electric cars per year by 2020, and rare earths will play a crucial role in this effort.</p>
   <h3>Wind Turbines in Europe</h3>
   <p>Europe is the world's leader in wind energy, with wind turbines accounting for 18% of the region's total electricity production. Rare earths are used in the production of the magnets which make the turbines more efficient. The development of the wind energy industry in Europe would not have been possible without the availability of rare earths in countries such as China, which supply over 90% of the world's rare earths.</p>
   <h3>Smartphones in Japan</h3>
   <p>Japan is a leader in the production of smartphones, which rely on rare earths for a range of components including the screens and the camera lenses. Japan has been investing in the development of new technologies to reduce the dependence on rare earths from China, including recycling and using substitutes where possible.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion - 3 Key Points</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Rare earths are key components in technological devices used in the G20 economies, including electric vehicles, wind turbines and smartphones.</li>
    <li>The G20 economies account for 75% of global rare earth production and consumption, making them critical players in the industry.</li>
    <li>The sustainability of rare earth mining and processing should be a key consideration for the G20 countries, to ensure a secure and resilient supply of these critical minerals for the future.</li>
   </ol>
