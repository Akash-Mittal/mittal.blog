    <h2>An Inspiring Story from Bangladesh</h2>
    <p>Akhter Hossain dreamed of becoming a successful businessman since his childhood. However, he faced a lot of struggles and challenges on his way to success. His family was poor, and he had to quit school at the age of 12 to start working in a textile factory. But his passion for entrepreneurship never faded away.</p>
    <p>Years later, Akhter started his own textile business with a small loan from a microfinance institution. Today, his company employs hundreds of people and exports products to many countries.</p>
    <p>Akhter's story is just one of the many examples of how Bangladesh has progressed on Human Development Index (HDI) parameters.</p>

    <h2>Bangladesh's Progress on HDI Parameters</h2>
    <p>HDI is a composite index that measures the well-being of people in a country based on three parameters: health, education, and income. According to the latest data from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Bangladesh has made remarkable progress on all three parameters in the last few decades.</p>
    <p>Let's take a look at some examples:</p>
    <ol>
     <li><strong>Health:</strong> In the 1980s, Bangladesh had one of the highest maternal mortality rates and child mortality rates in the world. Today, the country has reduced its maternal mortality rate by 75% and child mortality rate by 74%.</li>
     <li><strong>Education:</strong> Bangladesh has made impressive strides in improving access to education. In 1990, only 38% of the population had completed primary education. Today, the figure has risen to 72%. The country has also made significant progress in achieving gender parity in education.</li>
     <li><strong>Income:</strong> Bangladesh has achieved remarkable economic growth in the last few decades, with its GDP per capita increasing from $523 in 1990 to $2,064 in 2019. The country has also reduced its poverty rate from 44% in 1991 to 21% in 2018.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>All of these achievements have contributed to Bangladesh's rise on the HDI index. According to the latest UNDP report, Bangladesh ranks 133 out of 189 countries, which is ahead of countries like India, Pakistan, and Nepal.</p>

    <h2>Case Studies of Human Development in Bangladesh</h2>
    <p>Let's take a closer look at some case studies that highlight Bangladesh's progress on the HDI parameters:</p>
    <ol>
     <li><strong>Health:</strong> The "Community-Based Health Care" project in Bangladesh aims to improve maternal and child health by training community health workers to provide basic healthcare services in rural areas. The project has been successful in reducing maternal and child mortality rates and increasing the number of women seeking antenatal care.</li>
     <li><strong>Education:</strong> The "Female Secondary School Stipend" program provides financial incentives to girls from poor families to complete secondary education. The program has been successful in increasing enrollment and reducing dropouts among girls, and has also contributed to reducing child marriage rates in the country.</li>
     <li><strong>Income:</strong> The "Microfinance" industry in Bangladesh has played a crucial role in reducing poverty and empowering women. Microfinance institutions provide small loans to entrepreneurs and small businesses that are otherwise unable to access formal banking services. The industry has helped millions of women start their own businesses and become financially independent.</li>
    </ol>
