  <p>There is an old Chinese proverb that says, "actions speak louder than words." This phrase is especially relevant when it comes to the relationship between China and the United States. In recent years, tensions between the two countries have been high, with accusations of unfair trade practices, concerns over human rights violations, and disagreements over the handling of international crises. Despite these challenges, both nations have continued to communicate through words, but it is their actions that will ultimately shape the future of their relationship.</p>
  
  <p>In 2015, Chinese President Xi Jinping made an official state visit to the United States. During his trip, President Xi attended several high-profile events, including a meeting with President Barack Obama, a state dinner at the White House, and a speech at the United Nations. However, it was not these words or even the gestures of goodwill exchanged between the two leaders that made the biggest impact on the relationship between the two nations.</p>
  <p>Instead, it was a series of commitments made by the Chinese government in the months that followed. In the aftermath of President Xi's visit, China announced significant changes to its policies on intellectual property, opening up its financial markets to foreign investors, and reducing restrictions on foreign businesses operating within its borders. These actions demonstrated a genuine commitment to improving relations with the United States and helped to alleviate some of the concerns that had previously existed.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Actions that Matter</h2>
  <p>The story of President Xi's visit to the United States illustrates the importance of taking action in building strong diplomatic relationships. Here are a few additional examples of specific actions that China and the United States could take to improve their relationship:</p>
  <ol>
   <li><strong>Addressing Trade Imbalances</strong>: One of the primary sources of tension between China and the United States in recent years has been the issue of trade. Both nations accuse each other of engaging in unfair trade practices, leading to a significant trade deficit for the United States. To address this imbalance, China could take steps to reduce tariffs and other barriers to U.S. imports, while the United States could focus on boosting exports to China through increased investment in the country.</li>
   <li><strong>Promoting Human Rights</strong>: Another area of concern for the United States has been China's human rights record. The country has faced criticism for its treatment of ethnic minorities, its restrictions on freedom of speech and expression, and its use of surveillance technology to monitor its citizens. China could work to address these concerns by taking steps to protect human rights, such as reforming its detention and surveillance practices, while the United States could continue to advocate for greater respect for human rights and press China to enact meaningful change.</li>
   <li><strong>Collaborating on International Issues</strong>: The United States and China also have the opportunity to work together on a variety of international issues, including climate change, nuclear non-proliferation, and regional security. By partnering on these and other issues, both nations can demonstrate their shared commitment to global stability and peace.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>One example of a successful partnership between China and the United States is the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT). The JCCT was established in 1983 and serves as a forum for high-level discussions between the two nations on trade and investment issues. In recent years, the JCCT has helped to advance negotiations on a number of key issues, including intellectual property protection, food and drug safety, and e-commerce. The JCCT also provides a platform for both nations to express their concerns and work together on finding mutually beneficial solutions.</p>
  <p>Another example of successful collaboration between China and the United States is the U.S.-China Climate Change Agreement. In 2014, following a series of high-level talks and negotiations, both nations agreed to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. The agreement included specific targets for both nations and helped to demonstrate a shared commitment to addressing this global challenge.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion in Three Points</h2>

   <li>Specific actions that could improve the relationship include addressing trade imbalances, promoting human rights, and collaborating on international issues.</li>
