  <p>There is an old Chinese proverb that says, "actions speak louder than words." This phrase is especially relevant when it comes to the relationship between China and the United States. In recent years, tensions between the two countries have been high, with accusations of unfair trade practices, concerns over human rights violations, and disagreements over the handling of international crises. Despite these challenges, both nations have continued to communicate through words, but it is their actions that will ultimately shape the future of their relationship.</p>
  
  <p>In 2015, Chinese President Xi Jinping made an official state visit to the United States. During his trip, President Xi attended several high-profile events, including a meeting with President Barack Obama, a state dinner at the White House, and a speech at the United Nations. However, it was not these words or even the gestures of goodwill exchanged between the two leaders that made the biggest impact on the relationship between the two nations.</p>
  <p>Instead, it was a series of commitments made by the Chinese government in the months that followed. In the aftermath of President Xi's visit, China announced significant changes to its policies on intellectual property, opening up its financial markets to foreign investors, and reducing restrictions on foreign businesses operating within its borders. These actions demonstrated a genuine commitment to improving relations with the United States and helped to alleviate some of the concerns that had previously existed.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Actions that Matter</h2>
  <p>The story of President Xi's visit to the United States illustrates the importance of taking action in building strong diplomatic relationships. Here are a few additional examples of specific actions that China and the United States could take to improve their relationship:</p>
  <ol>
   <li><strong>Addressing Trade Imbalances</strong>: One of the primary sources of tension between China and the United States in recent years has been the issue of trade. Both nations accuse each other of engaging in unfair trade practices, leading to a significant trade deficit for the United States. To address this imbalance, China could take steps to reduce tariffs and other barriers to U.S. imports, while the United States could focus on boosting exports to China through increased investment in the country.</li>
   <li><strong>Promoting Human Rights</strong>: Another area of concern for the United States has been China's human rights record. The country has faced criticism for its treatment of ethnic minorities, its restrictions on freedom of speech and expression, and its use of surveillance technology to monitor its citizens. China could work to address these concerns by taking steps to protect human rights, such as reforming its detention and surveillance practices, while the United States could continue to advocate for greater respect for human rights and press China to enact meaningful change.</li>
   <li><strong>Collaborating on International Issues</strong>: The United States and China also have the opportunity to work together on a variety of international issues, including climate change, nuclear non-proliferation, and regional security. By partnering on these and other issues, both nations can demonstrate their shared commitment to global stability and peace.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>One example of a successful partnership between China and the United States is the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT). The JCCT was established in 1983 and serves as a forum for high-level discussions between the two nations on trade and investment issues. In recent years, the JCCT has helped to advance negotiations on a number of key issues, including intellectual property protection, food and drug safety, and e-commerce. The JCCT also provides a platform for both nations to express their concerns and work together on finding mutually beneficial solutions.</p>
  <p>Another example of successful collaboration between China and the United States is the U.S.-China Climate Change Agreement. In 2014, following a series of high-level talks and negotiations, both nations agreed to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. The agreement included specific targets for both nations and helped to demonstrate a shared commitment to addressing this global challenge.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion in Three Points</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>Actions speak louder than words in the relationship between China and the United States.</li>
   <li>Specific actions that could improve the relationship include addressing trade imbalances, promoting human rights, and collaborating on international issues.</li>
   <li>Successful partnerships, such as the JCCT and the U.S.-China Climate Change Agreement, demonstrate the potential for positive change through collaborative action.</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="intro">The relationship between China and the United States is one of the most significant bilateral relationships in the world today. Their ties have been strained in recent years due to a range of issues, from trade to human rights. China's military policies and its assertiveness in the South China Sea and Taiwan also present challenges to the United States. In this article, we will discuss the importance of actions, not just words, in improving China-U.S. relations.</p>
  
  <p>During the 1980s, China's economy began to liberalize and open up to the world. At the time, the United States was struggling with a trade deficit and saw China as a major opportunity to increase exports. However, the relationship between the two countries was still fraught with tension due to differences in political ideology and human rights issues.</p>
  <p>In 1989, the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing sparked international outrage, and the United States responded with sanctions against China. However, President George H.W. Bush believed that isolating China was not the best way forward, and instead sought to engage with the country. He sent his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, to China to meet with Deng Xiaoping, China's then-leader.</p>
  <p>During their meeting, Scowcroft brought up the issue of human rights and urged Deng to release political prisoners. Deng responded that China was not ready for democracy, and that what was most important was economic development. He made a proposal to Scowcroft: "Let's shake hands and pursue mutual benefits."</p>
  <p>Scowcroft accepted, and this handshake has been seen as the beginning of a new chapter in U.S.-China relations. The United States lifted some of its sanctions against China, and the two countries began to engage in a new era of economic cooperation. Today, China is the United States' largest trading partner.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Actions, Not Just Words</h2>
  <p>While words are important in diplomacy, actions are even more so. Here are some examples of how actions have played out in China-U.S. relations:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><b>The trade war:</b> In 2018, the Trump administration began a trade war with China, imposing tariffs on Chinese goods in an effort to reduce the trade deficit. The Chinese government responded with tariffs of its own. While negotiations have been ongoing, the two countries have yet to reach a final agreement. This situation highlights the need for actions that back up diplomatic words.</li>
   <li><b>The South China Sea:</b> China has been embroiled in disputes with several other countries in the South China Sea over territorial rights. The region is a major shipping lane and is believed to hold large reserves of oil and gas. The United States has been critical of China's military policies in the region, and has sent naval vessels and aircraft through contested waters to assert freedom of navigation. These actions have been seen as a way to support its allies in the region and to deter China from taking aggressive steps.</li>
   <li><b>The Taiwan Strait:</b> Taiwan has long been a contentious issue between China and the United States. China considers Taiwan to be a part of its territory and has threatened military action if the island declares independence. The United States has been a strong supporter of Taiwan, selling arms and providing diplomatic recognition. In January 2021, the United States sent an aircraft carrier to the region, a move that was seen as a warning to China not to take any aggressive actions towards Taiwan.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>One area where actions have had a positive impact on China-U.S. relations is in the realm of security cooperation. Despite their differences, the two countries have found common ground in the fight against terrorism. In 2015, the United States and China signed a memorandum of understanding on counterterrorism cooperation, which included sharing information and best practices.</p>
  <p>This cooperation has led to several high-profile successes. In 2016, China's Ministry of Public Security announced that it had arrested more than 400 people in a crackdown on a terrorist group with links to Syria. The operation was carried out with the help of U.S. intelligence, which provided information on the group's financing and recruitment. In 2017, China announced that it had foiled a plot to blow up a passenger plane flying from Australia to China. The plot was discovered with the help of U.S. intelligence.</p>
  <p>Another area where actions have had a positive impact is in education. The United States has long been a popular destination for Chinese students, but tensions over immigration and visas have threatened to put a damper on this trend. In response, several American universities have taken proactive steps to welcome Chinese students and to ease their transition to life in the United States. For example, Purdue University has set up a Chinese student support center, which offers counseling services, language classes, and social events. This center has been credited with helping to improve relations between Chinese students and the broader university community.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, actions, not just words, are crucial in improving China-U.S. relations. Diplomatic negotiations are important, but they must be backed up by tangible measures that demonstrate a commitment to cooperation and mutual respect. Here are three key takeaways:</p>
  <ol>
   <li><b>Security cooperation:</b> The fight against terrorism has provided a platform for China and the United States to work together, share information, and build trust.</li>
   <li><b>Actions in the South China Sea and Taiwan:</b> The United States has taken assertive steps to assert its presence in the region and to deter China from taking aggressive actions.</li>
   <li><b>Educational exchanges:</b> American universities have taken proactive steps to welcome Chinese students and to ease their transition to life in the United States.</li>
  </ol>
