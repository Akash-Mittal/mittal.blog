   <div class="story">
    <p>It was a warm summer evening in Moscow when President Putin made a bold announcement during his speech at the International Economic Forum, also known as the "Russian Davos". With confidence in his voice, he declared that Russia would no longer be reliant on foreign countries, particularly the West, for its economic growth. Instead, he proposed a new partnership with its eastern neighbor, China, with whom Russia had been strengthening its ties in recent years.</p>
    <p>As the audience of international business leaders and politicians applauded, there was a sense of both excitement and uncertainty in the air. Could Russia truly thrive without the support of its western counterparts? And what would this new partnership with China entail?</p>
   </div>
   <div class="examples">
    <h2>Examples of Russia's Dependence on China</h2>
    <p>Since Putin's announcement in 2014, Russia and China have engaged in numerous deals and agreements, such as:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>The Power of Siberia pipeline that transports natural gas from Russia to China</li>
     <li>The Belt and Road Initiative, a massive infrastructure project that aims to connect China to Europe through various routes, including Russian territory</li>
     <li>The BRICS grouping of emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), which China has been the largest contributor to in terms of capital investment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These partnerships have been critical for Russia, as it has faced Western sanctions and declining oil prices in recent years. China has become a lifeline for Russia's economy, providing it with much-needed investments and a market for its natural resources. However, this dependence on China comes with significant risks for Russia's long-term growth and political autonomy.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="case-studies">
    <h2>Case Studies: The Power of Siberia Pipeline</h2>
    <p>One of the most significant partnerships between Russia and China is the Power of Siberia pipeline, which began operating in December 2019. The pipeline is a critical component of Russia's economic plan to diversify its exports away from Europe and towards Asia.</p>
    <p>However, the pipeline project has come with several risks for Russia. For one, China is bargaining hard on the price of gas, which could impact Russia's revenue from the deal. Additionally, China has been actively investing in its own domestic energy resources, reducing its reliance on foreign imports. If China ends up reducing its demand for Russian gas, the pipeline's profitability could be in jeopardy.</p>
    <p>The pipeline has also raised concerns about Russia's political autonomy. As China becomes a bigger player in Russia's energy sector, some experts worry that Russia could become too reliant on China for its economic growth, limiting its ability to pursue its own political agenda independently.</p>

   <div class="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion: Russia's Dependence on China</h2>
    <p>While Russia's partnership with China has been critical for its economy, it comes with significant risks. Here are three key takeaways:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Russia's dependence on China for economic growth makes it vulnerable to shifts in China's domestic policies and global economic trends.</li>
     <li>The Power of Siberia pipeline highlights the potential risks and concerns about Russia's political autonomy with China as its biggest partner.</li>
     <li>As Russia looks to diversify its global partnerships, it will need to balance its reliance on China with its ability to maintain its political and economic sovereignty.</li>
    </ol>
