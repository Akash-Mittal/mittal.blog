  <p>In recent years, India and Pakistan have been experiencing an increase in the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones. The cyclones, which form over the warm tropical waters, can cause widespread damage, particularly in coastal regions. The affected areas often face devastating consequences such as loss of life, displacement, damages to infrastructure, and destruction of crops.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Tropical Cyclone BIPARJOY, which hit the Indian and Pakistani coasts in June 2023, is a recent example of the disaster that can be caused by such storms. The cyclone, a Category 4 event, resulted in widespread damage, forcing millions to seek refuge in shelters while billions of dollars were lost in terms of infrastructure damage, cropland destruction, and public health.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The following institutions were involved in monitoring the Cyclone:</p>
  <p>DG ECHO Partners: European Union's Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations</p>
  <p>GDACS: Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System</p>
  <p>IMD: India Meteorological Department</p>
  <p>PMD: Pakistan Meteorological Department</p>
  <p>JTWC: Joint Typhoon Warning Center</p>
  <p>UN OCHA: United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs</p>
  <p>Media</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Collaborative efforts from all these institutions had provided detailed information about the weather event. As a result, the governments had put much emphasis on early warning systems, evacuation plans, and disaster preparedness strategies.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One prime example of an Indian state taking proactive steps to ensure disaster readiness is the case of Odisha. In 2013, the state was affected by a massive cyclone, Phailin, that had resulted in a death toll of more than 40. However, during the 2019 Cyclone Fani, the state was able to evacuate 1.2 million people and avoid the loss of life to a greater extent, revealing the importance of disaster preparedness management strategies and data-driven analytics.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Similarly, Pakistan's Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has been actively involved in strengthening disaster-response capabilities among its various provinces. Under the leadership of PDMA, Pakistan's coastal province, Sindh, effectively evacuated nearly 200,000 people during Cyclone Tauktae in 2021, resulting in minimal loss of life.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, there is no doubt that tropical cyclones pose a severe threat to coastal communities in India and Pakistan. While the frequency of these natural calamities cannot be entirely predicted, authorities can take proactive measures, such as early warning systems, evacuation planning, and disaster preparedness management, to minimize the impact on affected communities. Finally, data-driven disaster management strategies are essential to save lives and minimize the impact of future disasters.</p>
