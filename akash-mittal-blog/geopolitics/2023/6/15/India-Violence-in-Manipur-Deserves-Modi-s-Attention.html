   <p><em>"They came in the middle of the night and set fire to our homes. We ran for our lives, leaving everything behind."</em></p>
   <p>These are the words of Raju, a resident of a village in Manipur, one of the Northeastern states of India. Raju's village was attacked by a group of militants, and he and his family are now refugees in their own country.</p>

   <h2>The Violence in Manipur</h2>
   <p>Manipur, like other Northeastern states of India, has been grappling with insurgency and militancy for decades. Different ethnic groups and organizations have been fighting for autonomy, identity, and political power. The state has witnessed violence, protests, strikes, and blockades, and the local people have suffered loss of life, property, and dignity.</p>
   <p>According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, there were 308 violent incidents in Manipur in 2020, in which 73 security personnel and 43 civilians were killed. In the first six months of 2021, there were 107 violent incidents, in which 14 security personnel and 7 civilians were killed.</p>
   <p>The violence in Manipur has several dimensions – inter-ethnic conflicts, clashes between security forces and militants, attacks on civilians and their properties, and extortion and intimidation by militant groups. The violence has also affected the development and progress of the state, as it has scared away investors, tourists, and professionals.</p>
   <h2>Why the Violence Deserves Modi's Attention</h2>
   <p>The violence in Manipur deserves the attention of Modi and the Indian government for several reasons:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Humanitarian crisis:</strong> The violence has caused a humanitarian crisis in Manipur, as thousands of people have become refugees in their own state. They have lost their homes, their crops, their cattle, their valuables, and their sense of security. They are living in makeshift camps, with limited access to food, water, sanitation, and healthcare. They are vulnerable to diseases, abuse, and exploitation. The government has a moral and legal responsibility to protect the lives and rights of its citizens, and to provide them with relief, rehabilitation, and justice.</li>
    <li><strong>National security:</strong> The violence in Manipur has implications for national security, as the state shares borders with Myanmar and is a gateway to other Northeastern states. The militant groups in Manipur have connections with external forces, and there are reports of arms smuggling, drug trafficking, and human trafficking. The instability in Manipur can spill over to other parts of India, and can also attract the attention of neighboring countries.</li>
    <li><strong>National unity:</strong> The violence in Manipur also raises questions about national unity and diversity. The state has diverse communities and cultures, and the violence has created divisions and suspicions among them. The state has also experienced discrimination and neglect from the central government, which has worsened the situation. The government needs to address the grievances and aspirations of the people of Manipur, and to ensure that they feel part of the Indian nation.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <p>Here are some case studies that illustrate the impact of violence in Manipur:</p>
   <div class="case-study">
    <h3>The Attack on a Border Outpost</h3>
    <p>In May 2021, a group of militants attacked a border outpost near the Myanmar border, killing 5 soldiers and injuring many others. The attack was carried out by a group called the People's Liberation Army (PLA), which wants to establish an independent Manipur. The attack led to a massive operation by the Indian Army, which killed several militants and recovered weapons and ammunition. The attack also created tension between India and Myanmar, as some of the militants crossed the border and sought refuge in Myanmar.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="case-study">
    <h3>The Blockade by Naga Groups</h3>
    <p>In November 2016, some Naga groups imposed an economic blockade on Manipur, in protest against the creation of seven new districts in the state. The blockade disrupted the supply of essential goods, including food, fuel, and medicines, and led to severe hardship for the people. The blockade lasted for 139 days, and was lifted only after the intervention of the central government. The blockade also highlighted the fragility of interstate relations and the need for dialogue and compromise.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="case-study">
    <h3>The Exodus of Migrant Workers</h3>
    <p>In August 2020, thousands of migrant workers from Manipur fled cities like Bangalore and Mumbai, in the wake of the COVID-19 lockdown. The workers feared for their safety and security, following rumors and threats of violence against them. The workers, who worked in sectors like hospitality, construction, and domestic help, faced discrimination and exploitation, and had to leave behind their belongings and wages. The exodus highlighted the vulnerability of migrant workers and the impact of violence on regional and national economies.</p>

   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <div class="conclusion">
    <h2>What Needs to Be Done</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>The government needs to recognize the severity and complexity of the violence in Manipur, and formulate a comprehensive and inclusive approach to peace and development.</li>
     <li>The government needs to engage with all stakeholders – the militant groups, the civil society, the political parties, and the citizens – in a dialogue that is based on mutual respect, trust, and understanding.</li>
     <li>The government needs to address the root causes of the violence – the historical injustices, the ethnic divides, the institutional failures, and the economic disparities – and provide sustainable solutions that ensure justice, equality, and dignity.</li>
