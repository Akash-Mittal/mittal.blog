   <h2>An interesting story of how India is poised to become a global economic force, surpassing China.</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>For decades, China has been hailed as the economic powerhouse of Asia and the world. However, this narrative is changing rapidly as India is poised to overtake China as the driving force behind global economic growth. The country already boasts of an impressive growth story and with the right policies in place, India is set to become the world's largest economy by 2050. But first, let's explore why Asia remains a bright spot for global growth.</p>
   <h3>Asia's Growth Potential</h3>
   <p>Asia's growth potential is tremendous. Asia is home to some of the world's largest economies such as India, China, Japan, and South Korea. These countries are also some of the most populous in the world, offering an enormous market for goods and services. The region's share of global GDP has been steadily increasing over the past few decades, and it is expected to continue doing so. Asia's rising middle class is another factor contributing to the region's strong growth outlook. With a rapidly expanding consumer base, there are ample opportunities for businesses to grow and thrive.</p>
   <h3>India's Growth Story</h3>
   <p>India is already the world's sixth-largest economy and has been growing at a rapid pace over the past few years. From 2015 to 2019, India's GDP grew at an average rate of 7.5% annually. In 2020, India was one of the few countries to have a positive growth rate despite the COVID-19 pandemic. This impressive growth story is due to a combination of factors such as a large and growing population, a young workforce, and a burgeoning middle class. India has also undertaken several structural reforms to boost economic growth, such as the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).</p>
   <h3>Case Studies: India vs. China</h3>
   <p>One of the most significant factors contributing to India's rise as an economic powerhouse is the ongoing trade war between the US and China. The US has imposed tariffs on many Chinese goods, making them less attractive to American consumers. This development has given India an opportunity to step in and become a key player in global supply chains. For instance, many American companies are moving their bases from China to India to avoid tariffs. This is a significant boost to India's manufacturing sector and an excellent opportunity to create jobs.</p>
   <p>Another example of India's growing influence can be seen in the tech sector. India is home to some of the world's largest tech companies such as Infosys, Wipro, and TCS. Indian tech giants are also expanding into new markets and are giving stiff competition to established players. For instance, Indian telecom company Jio has transformed the Indian telecom market, and its low-cost data plans have made it the largest telecom provider in India in a short span of time.</p>
   <h3>Conclusion</h3>
   <p>In conclusion, Asia remains a bright spot for global growth, and India is set to emerge as a frontrunner in this story. With a large and growing population, a young workforce, and a rapidly expanding middle class, India is poised to be the driving force behind global economic growth in the near future. Its ongoing reforms, recent favorable policies for foreign investors, and a steadily improving business environment bode well for its prospects. The rise of India also reflects a broader shift in the global economy, with Asia taking center stage. The future of the global economy looks increasingly Asian, and those who can adapt to this new reality stand to gain the most.</p>
