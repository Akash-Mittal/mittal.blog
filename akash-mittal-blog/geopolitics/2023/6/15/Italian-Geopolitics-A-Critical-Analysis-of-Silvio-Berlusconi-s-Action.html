  <p>Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media magnate, entrepreneur, and politician ensconced in the corridors of power for over two decades, has been a perplexing and divisive figure in Italian politics. Berlusconi, who served as the Prime Minister of Italy for three non-consecutive terms between 1994 and 2011, was celebrated as a revolutionary iconoclast by his admirers, while his detractors considered him a self-serving demagogue.</p>
  <h2>The Paradox of Berlusconi's Foreign Policy</h2>
  <p>One of the most enigmatic aspects of Berlusconi's political legacy is his foreign policy strategy. Berlusconi, who seemed to oscillate between his rapport-building proclivities and impetuous hawkishness, steered Italy's foreign policy in a direction that was often at odds with the predominant objectives of the European Union (EU). Despite his initial proclamations of aligning with the EU, Berlusconi's foreign policy remained muddled throughout his tenure, characterized as it was by his personalistic diplomacy and an incoherent policy that was more reactive than proactive.</p>
  <h3>Case Study 1: The Intervention in Libya</h3>
  <p>The intervention in Libya in 2011 was one of the defining moments in Berlusconi's foreign policy. Despite formally pledging Italy's support to the NATO-led intervention, Berlusconi's personalistic diplomacy and his private friendships with Muammar Gaddafi were a significant obstacle to a coherent Italy-EU foreign policy alignment on Libya. While the EU was pushing for regime change in Libya, Berlusconi was an advocate of a stable diplomatic relationship with Gaddafi. However, Italy finally supported the NATO-led intervention, but Berlusconi's personal influence was perceived as impeding an effective foreign policy strategy.</p>
  <h3>Case Study 2: Berlusconi's Cosying Up to Putin's Russia</h3>
  <p>Berlusconi's pro-Russia rhetoric and his overtures towards Putin's Russia were another perplexing aspect of his foreign policy. His apparent fondness for authoritarian strongmen (Gaddafi, Putin, etc.) and his opposition to the sanctions against Russia after its annexation of Crimea in 2014, were seen as a deviation from the EU's foreign policy objectives. Moreover, his business interests in Russia and his lavish lifestyle, in which he was seen boating and skiing with Putin, were perceived as a conflict of interest in his public service. Berlusconi's foreign policy reflected his personal interests rather than Italy's strategic objectives, which led to a misalignment of Italy's foreign policy towards Russia with the EU's values and interests.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion: The Ambiguity of Berlusconi's Foreign Policy in Three Points</h2>

   <li>Berlusconi's foreign policy was characterized by his personalistic diplomacy and often seemed more reactive than proactive, despite his proclamations of aligning with the EU's objectives.</li>

   <li>Berlusconi's enigmatic foreign policy underscores the need for a clear and coherent foreign policy strategy for Italy, which aligns with the EU's objectives and adheres to its values and interests.</li>
