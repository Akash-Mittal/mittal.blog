  <p>Cricket has always been a sport that has united people of different cultures, countries and backgrounds. With its popularity spreading across the globe, it has become a common language amongst enthusiasts. However, it's disappointing to see the political tensions between India and Pakistan affecting the future of cricket tournaments between the two nations.</p>
  <p>It's been more than 8 years since the last time India vs Pakistan Test series was held and it seems like there's no end in sight for the uncertainty surrounding bilateral cricket between the two nations. Amidst this, well-known cricket commentator and former Indian cricketer Aakash Chopra has expressed his views and made a strong case for including the much-awaited India-Pakistan series in the ICC World Test Championship.</p>
  <h2>The Significance of India-Pakistan Cricket</h2>
  <p>For many cricket fans, India vs Pakistan is more than just a sport. It's an emotion that brings two nations together, regardless of the result. The intensity of the rivalry and the passion of the fans can't be compared to any other cricketing contest.</p>
  <p>It's not just the emotions and passion that make this rivalry special, but also its commercial value. An India-Pakistan game is a huge boost for the cricketing economy and attracts a massive viewership both on television and at the stadiums.</p>
  <h2>Recent Instances of India-Pakistan Matches</h2>
  <p>The last time India and Pakistan played a bilateral series was in 2012-13. Since then, they have encountered each other in multilateral events like the Asia Cup and the ICC tournaments. However, none of them can match the excitement, anticipation and thrill of a bilateral series. Even after almost a decade without a Test series, the hype around the possibility of one is unmatchable.</p>
  <p>The recent instances of India and Pakistan playing cricket against each other have been a mixed bag. On one hand, the sporting world witnessed a thrilling India vs Pakistan encounter in the 2019 ICC World Cup, while, on the other hand, the 2021 edition of the Asia Cup was cancelled due to political tensions between the two nations.</p>
  <h2>Chopra's Case for Including India-Pakistan Series in WTC</h2>
  <p>After witnessing a plethora of empty stands and unfilled stadiums during the ICC World Test Championship (WTC), Aakash Chopra has voiced his concern and has made a strong case for adding India-Pakistan matches in the WTC tournament. With the cancellation of the Asia Cup 2021 due to political tension between both nations, the prospects of a bilateral series happening anytime soon looks bleak.</p>
  <p>However, Chopra believes that including India-Pakistan matches in the WTC can be a win-win situation for both the cricketing community and the political scenario between the nations. On one hand, cricket fans will be delighted to see their teams playing against each other, and on the other hand, the resumption of cricketing ties can go a long way in mending political relations between the two nations.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The future of India-Pakistan cricket is uncertain, but the resumption of bilateral series will bring joy to millions of cricketing fans worldwide. Aakash Chopra's suggestions of including these fixtures in the WTC tournament can be a small but significant step towards making this happen. It's high time that political tensions should not affect the game that has the power to unite people, and India-Pakistan cricket is a test case of that possibility.</p>
