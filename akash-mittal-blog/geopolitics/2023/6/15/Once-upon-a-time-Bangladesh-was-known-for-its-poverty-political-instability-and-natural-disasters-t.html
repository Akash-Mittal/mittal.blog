But now, the country is on the rise, and it may soon join the prestigious BRICS bloc.

  <p>One of the key factors that has contributed to Bangladesh's economic growth is the country's booming textile industry. In 2018, Bangladesh's textile exports reached $34 billion, making it the second-largest clothing exporter in the world after China. This growth has been fueled by the country's low cost of production, which has attracted many foreign buyers. Additionally, the government has taken steps to improve working conditions and raise wages, which has helped to attract more investors. The textile industry has also provided employment opportunities for millions of Bangladeshis, especially women who make up the majority of the workforce in the industry.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another factor that has contributed to the country's economic growth is its strategic location. Bangladesh is located at the crossroads of South and Southeast Asia, making it a key trade hub. In recent years, Bangladesh has invested heavily in building transportation infrastructure, including ports, highways, and airports. This has helped to connect Bangladesh with other countries in the region and has made it easier for businesses to move goods in and out of the country. As a result, Bangladesh has become an attractive destination for foreign investors who are looking to tap into the growing South Asian market.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>A case study that illustrates Bangladesh's potential is the country's partnership with China. In 2016, China launched the Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to connect China with the rest of the world through a network of infrastructure projects. Bangladesh is a key part of this initiative, with China investing over $10 billion in the country's infrastructure projects. One of the most significant projects is the Padma Bridge, which will connect the southwest region of the country with the rest of the country. The bridge will not only improve transportation, but it will also help to reduce poverty and boost economic growth in the region.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, Bangladesh's potential to become a member of BRICS is a testament to the country's economic progress and potential. The country's textile industry, strategic location, and partnerships with other countries have all contributed to its growth. If Bangladesh continues on this path, it has the potential to become one of the world's largest emerging economies.</p>
