  <p>This story resonates with the current global political climate. The world is facing various crises, ranging from climate change to terrorism, and different countries have their views on how to tackle them. In this global scenario, the UN Security Council (UNSC) is seen as the premier international body for maintaining peace and security. However, it is a delicate balancing act between the superpowers, the United States (US), and the "dragonbear," China, that is threatening to destabilize the world order.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The US and China are the world's largest economies and the two countries together account for more than 40% of global GDP. However, the bitter trade war between the two countries is affecting the global economy and has sparked fears of a looming recession. The UNSC has a crucial role to play in resolving this dispute.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The UNSC has been successful in managing conflicting interests between nations in the past. For example, in 2015, it lifted sanctions on Iran after a long and risky negotiation process. It also intervened in Syria's civil war, although the conflict remains unresolved. These examples illustrate that the UNSC is an effective platform for resolving disputes among nations.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>However, the US-China conflict is a much larger problem and requires a more nuanced approach. The UNSC must strike a balance between the interests of both countries. The US wants China to stop intellectual property theft and end currency manipulation, while China wants the US to lift tariffs and accept its growing influence as a superpower. The UNSC must find common ground and encourage both countries to work towards a solution that benefits everyone.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The G20, the group of the world's top 20 economies, must also play a crucial role in resolving the conflict. The G20 has a track record of bringing together important global actors, as seen in their meeting in 2008 during the global financial crisis. The G20 must come up with a plan to encourage both the US and China to come to a mutual agreement.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, the UNSC must play a more significant role in resolving the US-China conflict. The G20 can also facilitate dialogues between leaders and encourage a peaceful resolution to the conflict. The world is looking towards our global leaders to resolve this crisis and maintain the world order.</p>
