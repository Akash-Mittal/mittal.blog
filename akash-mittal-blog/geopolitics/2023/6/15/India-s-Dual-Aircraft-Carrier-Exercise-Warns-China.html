    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>India, one of the fastest growing economies in the world, has witnessed an increase in geopolitical tensions with its neighbour - China. In a move to showcase its military might, India has conducted a dual aircraft carrier exercise in the Bay of Bengal. The exercise involves two of India's formidable warships: the INS Vikrant and INS Vikramaditya. This article explores the implications of this move, with interesting stories, examples, and case studies.</p>

    <h2>The Power of Dual Aircraft Carriers</h2>
    <p>What is so special about the INS Vikrant and INS Vikramaditya? These two warships are considered to be the backbone of the Indian Navy. The INS Vikrant is a state-of-the-art aircraft carrier that was commissioned just a few months ago. It is equipped with the best technology that India has to offer and can carry up to 30 fighter jets at a time. The INS Vikramaditya, on the other hand, is a refurbished Soviet-era ship that joined the Indian Navy in 2013. It can carry up to 36 fighter jets and is considered to be one of the most lethal warships in the world.</p>
    <p>With the power of two aircraft carriers, India has now become a significant force to be reckoned with. The Indian Navy can now carry out operations in multiple regions, and at the same time, deter potential threats from its adversaries.</p>

    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>The recent dual aircraft carrier exercise conducted by India has not gone unnoticed by its neighbours, especially China. This move by India is being viewed as a clear signal to China that the country is ready to defend its maritime boundaries aggressively. The following case studies highlight the role of aircraft carriers in modern-day warfare:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>The Falklands War: The Falklands War is a classic example of how aircraft carriers can impact modern-day warfare. The British deployed two aircraft carriers - the HMS Invincible and HMS Hermes - to support their operations. These two warships proved to be critical in the eventual defeat of the Argentine forces.</li>
     <li>The Gulf War: During the Gulf War, the United States deployed several aircraft carriers to the region. These warships were instrumental in carrying out surgical strikes and air raids against Iraq, leading to the eventual defeat of its military.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The recent dual aircraft carrier exercise conducted by India is not just a show of military might but also a signal to its neighbours that the country is equipped to handle any potential threats. Here are three key takeaways from this development:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>India's investment in modern and advanced military technology has resulted in a strong and capable defence system.</li>
     <li>The dual aircraft carrier exercise is a clear message to China that India is ready to protect its maritime boundaries and interests.</li>
     <li>The deployment of these warships makes India a significant player in the region and a critical strategic ally for countries that value maritime security.</li>
