   <p>When Narendra Modi first became the Prime Minister of India, he wasn't allowed to enter the United States due to his alleged involvement in the 2002 Gujarat riots. However, in the years since, he has successfully managed to improve diplomatic ties with the US, becoming one of the country's most trusted allies in Asia. His recent visit to America underscores this growing partnership, and highlights the importance of Indo-US relations in the 21st century.</p>

   <h2>Examples of Indo-US Cooperation</h2>
   <p>Since coming to power, Modi has been keen on strengthening India's relationship with the United States. One of the key areas of cooperation between the two countries has been in defense, where India has been looking to ramp up its military capabilities to counter China's growing influence in the region. In 2016, India signed a logistics agreement with the US, which allows both countries to use each other's military assets and facilities, enhancing their capacity for joint operations.</p>
   <p>Another area of cooperation has been in the field of trade. The US is one of India's largest trading partners, and Modi's visit to America was intended to explore new opportunities for collaboration in this area. The two countries have been in talks about a free trade agreement for a while now, and Modi's visit could help to shore up support for this initiative.</p>

   <h2>Case Studies of Indo-US Partnership</h2>
   <h3>Space Exploration</h3>
   <p>India and the US have also been working together in the field of space exploration. In 2019, the two countries jointly launched a lunar mission called Chandrayaan-2, which aimed to study the south pole of the moon. While the mission was ultimately unsuccessful in its attempt to land a rover on the lunar surface, it was hailed as a significant step forward in Indo-US space cooperation.</p>
   <h3>Renewable Energy</h3>
   <p>Another area where India and the US have been cooperating is in the field of renewable energy. Modi has set a target for India to generate 175 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2022, and the US has been helping India to achieve this goal. In 2016, the US and India launched a joint initiative called the Partnership to Advance Clean Energy (PACE), which aims to accelerate the deployment of clean energy technologies in India.</p>
   <h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
   <p>The US and India have also been working together to address common threats in the field of cybersecurity. In 2020, the two countries signed an agreement to cooperate on critical infrastructure protection and cybersecurity. This agreement aims to enhance information sharing between the two countries and improve the security of their critical infrastructure.</p>
