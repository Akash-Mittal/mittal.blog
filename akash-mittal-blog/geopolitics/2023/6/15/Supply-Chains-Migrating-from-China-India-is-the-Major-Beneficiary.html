    <p>Meet Raju, a skilled metalworker from India. For years, he worked in a small factory in his village, making metal parts for furniture manufacturers. Despite his talent and hard work, Raju struggled to make ends meet. But one day, he got a call from a company in China that needed to outsource some of its manufacturing. The pay was good, and the opportunity was too good to pass up. So Raju packed his bags and moved to China.</p>
    <p>For a while, Raju enjoyed the novelty of living and working in a foreign country. But eventually, he started to feel the effects of China's growing economic power. Wages rose, job opportunities dwindled, and life became more expensive. And then came the pandemic, which disrupted global supply chains and caused mass layoffs throughout China.</p>
    <p>Raju knew he needed to make a change. So he started scouting for new opportunities, and soon he heard about the growing trend of supply chains migrating from China to India. With its large population, skilled workforce, and competitive wages, India was becoming an attractive destination for manufacturers looking to diversify their supply chains. Raju packed his bags once again and returned to India, where he now works for a company that specializes in precision manufacturing.</p>
    <h2>Examples of Supply Chain Migration</h2>
    <p>Raju's story is just one example of how supply chain migration is impacting people and economies around the world. In recent years, many companies have started exploring new manufacturing locations due to rising wages and geopolitical risks in China. For example:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Apple is reportedly considering moving some of its iPhone production from China to India, where labor costs are lower and the government is offering incentives for manufacturers.</li>
     <li>Bosch, the German engineering company, recently opened a new plant in India to produce electric powertrains for cars. The company cited India's "large pool of highly skilled engineers and technicians" as a key reason for its investment.</li>
     <li>Spanish fashion chain Zara is reportedly shifting some of its sourcing from China to India. The move is expected to create new job opportunities for Indian textile workers.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>These examples are part of a larger trend of supply chain migration that is benefiting countries like India. According to a recent report in the <em>Economic Times</em>, India has become a "key beneficiary" of companies' efforts to diversify their supply chains. The report cites several case studies:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Moody's Analytics, the financial research firm, has predicted that India will be among the biggest beneficiaries of supply chain shifts from China, along with Vietnam and Taiwan.</li>
     <li>US-based PTC, a global provider of technology platforms and solutions, has decided to relocate most of its product development and support roles from China to India. The company cited India's favorable business environment, skilled workforce, and English-language proficiency as key advantages.</li>
     <li>Japan's Panasonic Corporation recently announced plans to move its battery cell production from China to an existing plant in India. The company cited India's improving infrastructure and ease of doing business as reasons for the move.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The migration of supply chains from China to India is a complex trend with many factors at play. However, it is clear that India is emerging as a major beneficiary of this shift. Key advantages for India include its large population, skilled workforce, and favorable business environment.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, here are three key points to keep in mind when considering the trend of supply chain migration:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Supply chain migration is a global trend that is impacting economies and people around the world.</li>
     <li>India is becoming a major beneficiary of supply chain shifts from China, due to its large population, skilled workforce, and favorable business environment.</li>
     <li>Companies that are able to adapt to this changing landscape will be better positioned to succeed in the coming years.</li>
    </ol>
