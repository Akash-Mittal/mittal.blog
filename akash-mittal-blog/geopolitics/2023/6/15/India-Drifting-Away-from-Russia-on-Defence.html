  <p>India has long been a close ally of Russia when it comes to defence. However, in recent years, this relationship has seen a significant shift. India is now moving towards diversifying its defence partnerships, and Russia is no longer the only player in the game. So, what's behind this change? In this article, we will explore the reasons for India's growing distance from Russia on defence.</p>
  
  <p>In 2018, India and Russia signed a $5 billion deal for the acquisition of five S-400 Triumf missile systems. This was hailed as a major milestone in the strategic partnership between the two countries. However, the same year saw India also signing defence deals with other countries. For instance, India signed a $1.4 billion contract with Israel for the purchase of Spike anti-tank guided missiles. This marked a significant departure from India's traditional dependence on Russia for defence supplies.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Diversification</h2>
  <p>India's growing distance from Russia on defence can be seen in the following examples:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>In 2016, India signed a logistics agreement with the US, marking a significant departure from its non-aligned foreign policy.</li>
   <li>In 2018, India signed a deal with South Korea for the supply of artillery ammunition.</li>
   <li>In 2020, India signed a $3 billion contract with the US for the supply of 30 Apache attack helicopters.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <h3>Case Study 1: India's Growing Dependence on the US</h3>
  <p>The US has emerged as one of India's key defence partners in recent years. This can be seen in the following examples:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>In 2016, India signed the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) with the US, allowing the two countries to use each other's military bases for refuelling and resupply.</li>
   <li>In 2018, India and the US signed the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA), enabling the two countries to share encrypted communications and data, which is critical for defence cooperation.</li>
   <li>In 2020, India and the US signed the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA), which facilitates the exchange of geospatial intelligence between the two countries.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Case Study 2: India's Engagement with France</h3>
  <p>France has also emerged as an important defence partner for India. This can be seen in the following examples:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>In 2016, India signed a deal with France for the purchase of 36 Rafale fighter jets.</li>
   <li>In 2019, India and France launched their first joint maritime exercise, known as VARUNA.</li>
   <li>In 2020, India and France signed a deal for the supply of missiles for the Indian Air Force's Mirage 2000 jets.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2></h2>
  <p>In conclusion, India's growing distance from Russia on defence can be attributed to the following factors:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>India's need for diversification and reducing dependence on a single country for defence supplies,</li>
   <li>The emergence of other players in the defence market, such as the US and France, who offer state-of-the-art defence systems and technologies,</li>
   <li>The changing geopolitical landscape and India's increasing role as a regional power.</li>
  </ol>
