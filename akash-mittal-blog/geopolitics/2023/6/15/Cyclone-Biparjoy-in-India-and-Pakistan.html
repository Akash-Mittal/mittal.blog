   <p>By nightfall, the wind had become stronger and stronger, rattling against the window panes and whistling through the crevices. Prisha could hear the sound of falling branches and the occasional groan of trees ripped from their roots. She had heard of natural disasters before, but never experienced one firsthand.</p>

   <h2>The Impact of Cyclone Biparjoy</h2>
   <p>Cyclone Biparjoy made landfall in India and Pakistan on October 28, 2021, with wind speeds of up to 185 km/h. The severe cyclonic storm caused widespread damage, including uprooting trees, breaking electric poles, and damaging homes and buildings.</p>
   <p>According to the India Meteorological Department, the cyclone affected at least eight districts of the eastern Indian state of Odisha, resulting in the displacement of more than a million people. In Pakistan, the cyclone caused flooding in Balochistan, Sindh, and Punjab provinces, damaging crops, killing livestock, and displacing thousands of people.</p>
   <h2>The Link to Climate Change</h2>
   <p>Cyclones and hurricanes are not a new phenomenon, but climate scientists warn that they are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change. Rising sea levels and warmer ocean temperatures provide more energy for storms to form and intensify. The impact of natural disasters like Cyclone Biparjoy is also amplified by environmental degradation, deforestation, and poor infrastructure.</p>
   <p>The 2021 UN Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26, is currently underway in Glasgow, Scotland, where leaders from around the world are discussing ways to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change. The frequency and intensity of natural disasters like Cyclone Biparjoy serve as a warning that urgent action is needed to address climate change before it's too late.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <p>The impact of Cyclone Biparjoy is not just limited to the immediate destruction and displacement it caused. It also has long-term consequences for the affected communities, especially the vulnerable populations who are already struggling with poverty and marginalization.</p>
   <p>One example is the coastal communities in Odisha, where fishing is the primary livelihood source. The damage to their boats and fishing nets, as well as the destruction of mangrove forests, will have a significant impact on their income and food security in the coming months. In Pakistan, farmers who rely on rainfall to irrigate their crops are now facing a double whammy of drought and floods.</p>
   <p>The impact of Cyclone Biparjoy also highlights the need for disaster preparedness and resilient infrastructure. In India, the government's Cyclone FANI experience in 2019 demonstrated the importance of early warning systems, coastal shelters, and evacuation plans in minimizing the loss of life and property. In Pakistan, the government's National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has been working to build flood protection infrastructure and early warning systems, but more needs to be done.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, Cyclone Biparjoy is just one example of the devastating impact of natural disasters on vulnerable communities. It is a wake-up call for urgent action on climate change, disaster preparedness, and resilient infrastructure. The world needs to come together to curb carbon emissions, implement adaptation measures, and provide support to the communities most affected by the impact of climate change.</p>
