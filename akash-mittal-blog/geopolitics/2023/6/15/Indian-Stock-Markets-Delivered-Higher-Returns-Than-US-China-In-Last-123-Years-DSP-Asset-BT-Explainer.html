     <h2>Story</h2>
     <p>Imagine investing your money in the stock market 123 years ago, in 1898. You have three choices: India, the United States, and China. Which market would you choose?</p>
     <p>According to a recent analysis by financial firm DSP Asset Management, the Indian stock market would have provided the highest returns over the last century compared to the other two.</p>
     <p>This analysis is based on data from 1898 to 2020, which includes the colonial era, independence, and modern times. It shows that the Indian stock market outperformed the US and China by a significant margin, with an average annual growth rate of 6.5% compared to 5.5% and 5.1% for the US and China, respectively.</p>

     <h2>Analysis</h2>
     <p>The higher returns in the Indian stock market can be attributed to several factors:</p>
     <ol>
      <li><strong>Economic Growth:</strong> India has seen significant economic growth over the last few decades, with a population of over 1 billion and steady GDP growth. This growth has led to a rise in disposable income, which has driven demand for securities and led to higher stock prices.</li>
      <li><strong>Political Stability:</strong> Despite some periods of instability, India has generally maintained a stable government since gaining independence in 1947. This political stability has helped to create an environment conducive to economic growth and investment.</li>
      <li><strong>Demographics:</strong> India has a large and growing workforce, which makes it an attractive market for businesses. As the population grows and becomes more affluent, this trend is likely to continue.</li>
     </ol>
