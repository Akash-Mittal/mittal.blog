   <p>As the threat of the cyclone looms over India and Pakistan, more than 100,000 people have been forced to evacuate their homes and take refuge in temporary shelters.</p>
   <p>While natural disasters like cyclones are not uncommon in this part of the world, it still remains a challenge for the governments to evacuate the people and provide them with necessary resources in times of crisis.</p>
   <h2>Examples</h2>
   <p>In the year 1999, a super cyclone hit the eastern coast of India causing damage worth billions of dollars and the loss of thousands of lives. It was a wakeup call for the government to better equip themselves to deal with such situations and create better infrastructure for evacuation and rehabilitation.</p>
   <p>In recent years, the state of Kerala in India has been grappling with floods almost every year. In 2018, when floods hit the state, the government had to rely on the help of locals and volunteers to rescue people and provide them with food and shelter.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <h3>India – Cyclone Fani</h3>
   <p>In 2019, Cyclone Fani made landfall in the state of Odisha, India. The government had to evacuate more than 1.2 million people to avoid casualties. In addition, the government set up 43,000 shelters along the coast and deployed emergency response teams to the affected areas. Due to the preparedness of the government, the number of casualties was significantly lower than what was predicted by the meteorological department.</p>
   <h3>Pakistan – Floods in 2019</h3>
   <p>In 2019, Pakistan experienced floods due to torrential rains. More than 300 people died and 200,000 were left homeless. The government responded by providing food and medical help to the affected people and setting up temporary shelters for them. The government also issued flood warnings to the people living in vulnerable areas well in advance, which helped reduce the number of casualties.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>It is evident that natural disasters are inevitable, but the preparedness of the government can make a huge difference in minimizing the damage caused by them. Here are three key takeaways from the situation:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Investing in better infrastructure for evacuation and rehabilitation.</li>
    <li>Issuing timely warning to the people living in vulnerable areas.</li>
    <li>Providing necessary resources like food, water and shelter to the affected people.</li>
   </ol>
