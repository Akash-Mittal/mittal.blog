  <p>It was a sunny day in Lahore, Pakistan when Finance Minister Ishaq Dar gave a press conference. He was determined to shed light on the ongoing situation of Pakistan's economy and the challenges that were coming its way.</p>
  <p>Dar announced, "Geopolitics is underway to default Pakistan." The statement was a wake-up call for not only his country but for the entire world. It seems that the economic conditions in Pakistan are about to worsen, and the possible reasons could be emerging global powers and changing world dynamics.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Geopolitics Impact on Pakistan's Economy</h2>
  <p>The following are some examples of how geopolitics is impacting Pakistan's economy:</p>
  <h3>India's Political Agenda</h3>
  <p>India has always been a competitor of Pakistan in the region, and their relations have always been tense. India's rising power ambitions and its strategic collaborations with western countries have created a sense of insecurity in Pakistan. The Kashmir issue is another challenge for Pakistan that is affecting its economy. The recent revocation of Article 370 by India has further worsened the situation for Pakistan, and they fear that India might disrupt their economy through different means.</p>
  <h3>China and the US Cold War</h3>
  <p>China and the United States are engaged in a trade war, and this tussle has impacted the world economy. The US has imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, and China has retaliated with tariffs on US goods. The impact of this war is felt globally, and Pakistan is not immune to it. China is Pakistan's all-weather friend, and their economic collaboration is significant for Pakistan's economic growth. If China's economy slows down due to the ongoing trade war, it will directly affect Pakistan.</p>
  <h3>Pakistan's Strategic Location</h3>
  <p>Pakistan has a unique location that makes it an essential country in terms of global politics. It shares its borders with Iran, Afghanistan, India, and China, making it a hotbed for geopolitical strategies. The US and other western powers are eyeing Pakistan as a possible ally to counter China's growing influence in the region. If Pakistan decides to support the US, it might cause tension between China and Pakistan, impacting their collaborations.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>The following are some case studies on how geopolitics impacted Pakistan's economy in the past:</p>
  <h3>US Sanctions on Pakistan</h3>
  <p>In 1990, the US imposed economic sanctions on Pakistan due to its nuclear program. The ban caused Pakistan's economy to suffer severely. Pakistan had to adopt stringent measures like reducing imports, increasing exports, and curbing government expenditures to cope with the situation.</p>
  <h3>The Soviet-Afghan War</h3>
  <p>The Soviet-Afghan war that lasted from 1979 to 1989 was another example of geopolitics impacting Pakistan's economy. The US and its western allies funded the Afghan resistance and used Pakistan as a base, requiring Pakistan to bear additional expenses. The war resulted in an influx of Afghan refugees and fundamentalism in Pakistan, causing economic instability.</p>
  <h3>Rising Oil Prices in the Gulf War</h3>
  <p>The Gulf War of 1990 and the subsequent oil embargo severely impacted Pakistan's economy. The rise in oil prices caused inflation and a balance of payments crisis for Pakistan. Pakistan had to borrow from international markets to manage its finances, further increasing its external liabilities.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Geopolitics has always been a significant factor affecting the world economy, and Pakistan is not an exception. The country is trying to emerge from its economic troubles, but the changing world dynamics and geopolitical challenges are hindering its progress. The following are some key points that need to be considered:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>It is important to have a stable and predictable relationship with the neighboring countries to ensure trade and economic collaborations are not affected.</li>
   <li>Pakistan should diversify its trade to reduce its dependence on a single market.</li>
   <li>The government should work on increasing exports and controlling the balance of payments to ensure Pakistan's economic stability.</li>
  </ul>
