   <p>The year was 1925, and the potash industry was booming. German chemist Fritz Haber had just discovered a new way to extract potash from the earth, and everyone wanted in on the action. But as demand for potash increased, so did tensions between the major players in the industry. And when World War II broke out, the potash industry became a pawn in the global game of geopolitical power.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Geopolitics in the Potash Industry</h2>
   <p>Fast forward to today, and the potash industry is once again being shaped by geopolitical forces. For example:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The trade war between the United States and China has had a major impact on the potash industry, as China is one of the world's biggest importers of potash.</li>
    <li>The ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukraine have disrupted potash production in the region, which is one of the world's key potash suppliers.</li>
    <li>The recent coup in Belarus, which is also a major potash exporter, has led to uncertainty and instability in the industry.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Case Studies in the Potash Industry</h2>
   <p>Two companies in particular are feeling the effects of these geopolitical forces:</p>
   <h3>Mosaic (NYSE:MOS)</h3>
   <p>Mosaic is a US-based potash producer that has been hit hard by the trade war with China. In 2018, the company had to halt production at its Esterhazy mine in Saskatchewan due to low demand from China. And in 2020, Mosaic announced that it would be suspending production at its Colonsay potash mine in Saskatchewan due to weak demand and low prices.</p>
   <h3>Nutrien (NYSE:NTR)</h3>
   <p>Nutrien is a Canadian potash producer that has also been impacted by the trade war with China, as well as the tensions between Russia and Ukraine. In 2019, the company had to shut down its Rocanville mine in Saskatchewan due to a rail strike that disrupted transportation of their product. And in 2020, Nutrien announced that it would be closing its processing facility in Trinidad due to weak demand and low prices.</p>
   <h2></h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Geopolitical forces have always played a role in the potash industry, and they will continue to do so in the future.</li>
    <li>Companies that are heavily reliant on exports to China may struggle in the short term due to the ongoing trade war.</li>
    <li>Amidst all of this uncertainty, companies that can remain agile and adapt to changing market conditions will be the ones that come out on top.</li>
   </ol>
