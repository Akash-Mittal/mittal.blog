   <p>Journalism is an essential tool to bring transparency and accountability to any political system. However, the relationship between journalists and governments can sometimes be rocky, as the former strive to uncover the truth, while the latter try to control the narrative. This became apparent when China decided to expel three Indian journalists in March 2021. The move was seen as retaliation for India's expulsion of Chinese journalists in 2020 due to their alleged involvement in the "Wuhan virus" misinformation campaign. This article delves into the implications of this decision and why it is crucial for Beijing to allow Indian journalists to continue to work in China.</p>

   <h2>Examples with Case Studies</h2>
   <p>China's decision to expel Indian journalists has serious implications for the freedom of the press in both countries. According to the <a href="https://rsf.org/en/china">Reporters Without Borders</a>, China is ranked 177 out of 180 countries in the Press Freedom Index. The Indian government, on the other hand, has been criticized for using draconian laws to restrict media freedom. In such a scenario, the presence of Indian journalists in China is crucial to provide a counter-narrative to the Chinese media's coverage of India. This is particularly important given the tense border situation between the two countries.</p>
   <p>The expulsion of Indian journalists is not an isolated incident. China has expelled journalists from various countries in recent years for reporting on sensitive issues such as human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong. In doing so, China is not only suppressing the freedom of the press, but it is also denying its citizens access to objective information. This lack of transparency has serious repercussions, as seen in the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, where the Chinese government downplayed the severity of the disease, leading to a global pandemic.</p>
   <p>Given the above examples, it is evident that the presence of journalists in any country is essential to provide objective information to their respective audiences. By expelling Indian journalists, China is denying its citizens access to unbiased reporting and is also driving a wedge in its relationship with India. This move is counterproductive and goes against the spirit of diplomacy that is essential for any nation to prosper.</p>
