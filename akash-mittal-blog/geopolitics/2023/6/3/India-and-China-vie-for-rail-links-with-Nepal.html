   <p>It was a hot summer day when Ravi and Rajesh, two residents of Kathmandu, Nepal were traveling to Beijing, China for a business trip. As they were waiting to board the train at the railway station, they couldn't help but notice the state-of-the-art facilities and smooth functioning of the train.</p>
   <p>One of them remarked, "If only we had such trains in Nepal, it would revolutionize our transport system and boost economic development".</p>
   <p>Their conversation is not far-fetched as many in Nepal have longed for better rail connectivity, and it seems like their wish might come true soon.</p>
   <h2>India and China's interest in Nepal</h2>
   <p>Indo-Nepal relations have always been close due to their shared cultural, historical, and geographical ties. India has been the most significant trade partner for Nepal and has provided aid in infrastructure and development projects. India has contributed substantially to building Nepal's road network which has connected more remote regions to the rest of the country.</p>
   <p>China has also been making inroads into Nepal, offering aid, infrastructure, and economic cooperation. China's strategy involves building infrastructure in neighboring countries as part of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to boost its connectivity and expand its global reach.</p>
   <h2>Railway connectivity with Nepal</h2>
   <p>Railway connectivity is critical for Nepal as it is a landlocked country and has to rely on India's ports for most of its imports and exports. Currently, Nepal has no rail connectivity with any of its neighboring countries. However, things might change soon as both India and China are interested in building railways connecting Nepal with their respective countries.</p>
   <h3>India's interest: Jaynagar-Kurtha railway line</h3>
   <p>India has proposed building the Jaynagar-Kurtha railway line in Nepal, connecting Jaynagar in Bihar state of India with Kurtha in Nepal. This railway line will not only provide connectivity to the border town but also link other parts of Nepal via the Janakpur-Jaynagar broad gauge railway line. The project will cover a distance of around 68 km and will be completed in three years.</p>
   <p>India has also proposed extending the railway line to Kathmandu, which will provide better connectivity to Nepal's capital. This railway line will be a game-changer for Nepal as it will provide a direct link to India's vast railway network.</p>
   <h3>China's interest: Kerung-Kathmandu railway line</h3>
   <p>China has proposed building the Kerung-Kathmandu railway line, which will link Kathmandu with China's Tibet Autonomous Region. This railway line will cover a distance of 121 km, with 98 km in Nepal and 23 km in Tibet. This railway line will not only improve connectivity but also boost tourism and trade between the two countries.</p>
   <p>The Kerung-Kathmandu railway line is part of China's BRI and will be connected to its railway network, which will provide Nepal access to Central Asia and Europe. This railway line will give Nepal an alternative trade route to India's ports, reducing its dependence on a single country.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The competition between India and China to build railway connectivity with Nepal is a win-win situation for Nepal. Better connectivity will improve trade, tourism, and economic development. The two railway lines will complement each other, providing Nepal with access to India and China's vast railway networks.</p>
