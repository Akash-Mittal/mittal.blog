  <h1>IMF Gives Big Blow to Pakistan: Will Die of Hunger</h1> <img src="images/IMF-Gives-Big-Blow-to-Pakistan-Will-Die-of-Hunger.jpeg" alt="+IMF-Gives-Big-Blow-to-Pakistan-Will-Die-of-Hunger+">
  <p>In recent news, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has given Pakistan a big blow which could lead to the nation struggling to feed its own people. This news has sent shockwaves across the world. Pakistan has always been known for its unstable economy, but could this be the final nail in the coffin?</p>
  <h2>Examples of IMF's Impact on Other Nations</h2>
  <p>Before we delve into the impact of this decision on Pakistan, let's take a look at some examples of the IMF's impact on other countries.</p>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>Greece:</strong> In 2010, Greece received â‚¬110 billion bailout from the IMF in exchange for implementing austerity measures. This caused widespread unemployment and poverty in the country.</li>
   <li><strong>Argentina:</strong> Argentina faced a similar fate in 2001 when the IMF imposed tough conditions for a $39.7 billion loan. The country's economy fell apart, leading to riots and a default on its debt.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Case Studies on Pakistan's Economy</h2>
  <p>The IMF's decision is going to have a significant impact on Pakistan. Let's take a look at some case studies that highlight the state of Pakistan's economy.</p>
  <h3>Case Study 1: Inflation Rate</h3>
  <p>Pakistan has one of the highest inflation rates in the world. In June 2019, the inflation rate was recorded at 9.1%. This means that basic items such as food and fuel are becoming unaffordable for the general population.</p>
  <h3>Case Study 2: Public Debt</h3>
  <p>Pakistan has a staggering public debt of US$73 billion. This has been accumulating over the years due to the country's inability to repay loans. The IMF's decision will only add to this debt burden, making it even more difficult for the country to repay its loans.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The IMF's decision is going to have a disastrous impact on Pakistan's economy. The country is already struggling to cope with a high inflation rate and a staggering public debt. This decision will only make things worse, leading to further poverty, unemployment and hunger.</p>
  <ol>
   <li>The IMF decision will increase the poverty and unemployment rate in Pakistan.</li>
   <li>Pakistan's public debt will rise further making it difficult to repay loans.</li>
   <li>The country's ability to feed its own people will be at risk due to the impact on its economy.</li>
  </ol>
