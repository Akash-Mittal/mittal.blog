  <h1>How former Pakistan PM Imran Khan's PTI party is disintegrating</h1> <img src="images/How-former-Pakistan-PM-Imran-Khan-s-PTI-party-is-disintegrating.jpeg" alt="+How-former-Pakistan-PM-Imran-Khan-s-PTI-party-is-disintegrating+">
  <p>Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party won the Pakistan general elections in 2018 with a sweeping majority, promising to bring change and prosperity to the country. However, less than three years into power, the party is disintegrating due to internal conflicts, corruption, and ineffective governance.</p>
  <h2>Internal Conflicts</h2>
  <p>One of the major reasons behind the disintegration of PTI is the internal conflicts within the party. Imran Khan, who was once a unifying figure for the party, has now become a divisive force. Many senior party leaders and lawmakers have accused him of authoritarianism and failing to consult the party before making crucial decisions.</p>
  <p>Recently, a group of PTI lawmakers led by former minister Gulzar Khan announced that they were forming a new political party due to dissatisfaction with Imran Khan's leadership. Similarly, there have been reports of rifts between Imran Khan and some of his closest allies, including his finance minister and foreign minister.</p>
  <h3>Case Study 1: Pervez Khattak</h3>
  <p>Pervez Khattak, a senior PTI leader and former chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, was appointed as the defence minister in Imran Khan's cabinet. However, he resigned from the position within a year, citing "personal reasons". Reports suggest that the real reason for his resignation was his displeasure with Imran Khan's leadership and his alleged interference in the affairs of the defence ministry.</p>
  <h3>Case Study 2: Jahangir Tareen</h3>
  <p>Jahangir Tareen, a wealthy businessman and a close ally of Imran Khan, played a key role in PTI's victory in the 2018 elections. However, he fell out with Imran Khan over allegations of corruption and misuse of authority. Tareen was subsequently removed from his position as the chairman of PTI's sugar inquiry commission. Tareen has denied the allegations and has accused Imran Khan of targeting him for political reasons.</p>
  <h2>Corruption</h2>
  <p>Another reason for PTI's disintegration is the rampant corruption within the party. Imran Khan came to power on the promise of accountability and transparency, but his own party members have been accused of corruption and nepotism. Furthermore, Imran Khan has been accused of shielding his close allies from corruption charges.</p>
  <h3>Case Study 3: Aleem Khan</h3>
  <p>Aleem Khan, a senior PTI leader and a close ally of Imran Khan, was appointed as the Punjab provincial minister for local government and community development. However, he was arrested by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on charges of corruption and illegal assets. Khan was subsequently released on bail, but the case is still ongoing. Many PTI lawmakers and supporters have accused Imran Khan of protecting Aleem Khan from accountability.</p>
  <h2>Ineffective Governance</h2>
  <p>PTI's manifesto promised to improve governance and deliver on its promises of reform and development. However, the party has been criticized for its mismanagement, incompetence, and inability to deliver on its promises.</p>
  <h3>Case Study 4: Health Crisis</h3>
  <p>Pakistan is currently facing a major health crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the PTI government has been accused of mishandling the crisis, with reports of shortages of essential medical supplies and poor management of quarantine centers. Furthermore, there have been allegations of corruption and nepotism in the distribution of medical supplies and funds.</p>
  <h3>Case Study 5: Economic Crisis</h3>
  <p>Pakistan is also facing a major economic crisis, with high inflation, a falling currency, and a rising debt burden. The PTI government has been criticized for its inability to revive the economy, with many economists and business leaders calling for a change in economic policies and a stronger focus on reforms.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The disintegration of PTI is a worrying development for Pakistan. The country is facing major challenges, including a health crisis, an economic crisis, and a security crisis. The ruling party needs to be united and effective in order to tackle these challenges and deliver on its promises of reform and development. However, the internal conflicts, corruption, and ineffective governance within PTI are hindering its ability to govern effectively.</p>
