   <p>China has been a major topic of discussion in global politics for quite some time now. With its growing influence, the world is divided over the right approach towards China. While some countries believe in engaging with China and relieving tensions, others are wary of the dragon's intentions. In this scenario, Joe Biden's China Reset seems like a bad idea. Here's why:</p>
   <h2>One Size Fits All Approach Doesn't Work</h2>
   <p>Joe Biden's China policy aim at repairing the relationship between the US and China and creating a stable and predictable framework for the same. However, the approach seems one size fits all policy. While it may work in some cases, it may not necessarily work with China. The country has its own interests, and its leadership is known to be aggressive and uncompromising. Therefore, expecting China to fall in line with a reset is not pragmatic.</p>
   <h2>China's Human Rights Abuses Shouldn't be Ignored</h2>
   <p>While the world may want to engage with China, it should not turn a blind eye towards China's human rights abuses. From Hong Kong to Xinjiang, China has been repeatedly accused of violating human rights. Under such circumstances, it becomes essential for the global community to demand an end to these injustices. By softening its stance, the US may end up normalizing such behavior.</p>
   <h2>China is not a Stabilizing Force in the World</h2>
   <p>The Chinese leadership has made it clear that China's rise is not just a financial rise, but it wants to establish China as a global superpower. It has been taking aggressive steps in the South China Sea and other disputed territories. Its community-building initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative have been criticized for increasing China's influence in the region. In such circumstances, a policy of friendship with China may not end well for the US and its allies.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>Joe Biden's China Reset policy may have been aimed at easing tensions and stabilizing the relationship between the US and China. But a closer look at the Chinese government's policies and approaches suggests otherwise. A firm approach is the need of the hour. To maintain peace and stability in the world, the US needs to take a strong stance against China and its aggressive policies.</p>
