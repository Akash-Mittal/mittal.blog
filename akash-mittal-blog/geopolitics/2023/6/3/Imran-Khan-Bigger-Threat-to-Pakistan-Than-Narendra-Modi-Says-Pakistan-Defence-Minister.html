  <h1>Imran Khan Bigger Threat to Pakistan Than Narendra Modi Says Pakistan Defence Minister</h1> <img src="images/Imran-Khan-Bigger-Threat-to-Pakistan-Than-Narendra-Modi-Says-Pakistan-Defence-Minister.jpeg" alt="+Imran-Khan-Bigger-Threat-to-Pakistan-Than-Narendra-Modi-Says-Pakistan-Defence-Minister+">
  <p>Imagine a government that has failed to deliver on its promises, curtailed freedom of expression, pressurized the judiciary, and intensified corruption. Now imagine that government with a leader who has been accused of relying on the military to obtain and maintain power, who has openly praised extremist groups and shared their ideology, and who sees himself as a messiah to the people. This is the situation in Pakistan under Prime Minister Imran Khan, according to Pakistan's former defence minister, Khawaja Asif.</p>
  <p>Asif recently gave a statement in which he declared that Imran Khan is a bigger threat to Pakistan than Narendra Modi, India's Prime Minister. Asif argued that Khan's actions are hurting Pakistan's image and causing divisions within the country. He also claimed that Khan is governing under the control of the military, which is eroding democracy and further weakening the already fragile political system.</p>
  <p>The statement by Asif has created a stir in the Pakistani political arena and raises some significant questions about Khan's leadership. Let's take a closer look at the reasons why Asif believes that Khan is a bigger threat than Modi.</p>
  <h2>Failure to Deliver on Promises</h2>
  <p>During his election campaign, Khan made big promises to alleviate poverty, create jobs and provide affordable health and education to the masses. However, after more than two years in office, he has failed to fulfil most of these promises. According to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, poverty has increased from 24.3% to 25.3% during the first year of Khan's government. Furthermore, the unemployment rate has increased from 5.8% to 6% during the same period.</p>
  <p>Khan's government also failed to provide affordable health and education to the masses. Instead, he cut the budget for these sectors, which has led to an increase in the number of out-of-school children and people unable to afford healthcare. According to a report by the Alif Ailaan Campaign, about 22.5 million children aged between 5 and 16 years are out of school in Pakistan.</p>
  <h2>Curtailed Freedom of Expression</h2>
  <p>The Khan's government has also been accused of curbing freedom of expression in the country. Journalists, bloggers, and social activists are often harassed and intimidated by the ruling party and its supporters. In some cases, they have been abducted, tortured, and killed for speaking out against the government. Furthermore, the government has recently passed laws, such as the Pakistan Electronic Crimes Act, which further restricts freedom of expression and imposes harsh sentences on those who criticize the government.</p>
  <p>For example, in January 2020, journalist Matiullah Jan was abducted from outside a school in Islamabad and was released after 12 hours. Jan had been critical of the government's policies and had recently reported on the abduction of another journalist. Similarly, in February 2017, five bloggers and social activists, known for their liberal views, were abducted and disappeared for weeks. Eventually, they were released, but they were accused of blasphemy and had to flee the country out of fear for their lives.</p>
  <h2>Controlled by the Military</h2>
  <p>Khan's government is widely perceived to be controlled by the military, which has a history of interfering in politics. The military has always played a crucial role in the politics of Pakistan and has often been accused of toppling elected governments. However, Khan's rise to power was orchestrated by the military, and many of his cabinet members are former military officers.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, the military is seen as backing Khan's government in decisions such as the arrest and imprisonment of opposition leaders, the manipulation of the media, and the curbing of freedom of expression. The military's role has also led to concerns about the erosion of democracy in Pakistan, as it is seen as supplanting elected representatives with its own loyalists.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, the statement by Asif highlights some serious concerns regarding Khan's leadership and his government. Asif has accused Khan of failing to deliver on his promises, curbing freedom of expression, and working under military control. It remains to be seen whether these allegations are true, but they underscore the challenges facing Pakistan's political system and the need for leaders who can deliver on their promises and strengthen democratic institutions.</p><!-- Reference urls -->
