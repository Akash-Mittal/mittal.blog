  <h1>China to Renew Visas of Scribes, Says MEA Tribune India</h1> <img src="images/China-to-Renew-Visas-of-Scribes-Says-MEA-Tribune-India.jpeg" alt="+China-to-Renew-Visas-of-Scribes-Says-MEA-Tribune-India+">
  <p>China has assured India that it will renew the visas of journalists from leading Indian newspapers such as <em>The Hindu</em>, <em>The Times of India</em>, and <em>The Indian Express</em>, who are based in China and due to return to India for visa renewal, said the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Thursday.</p>
  <h2>An interesting story about the situation</h2>
  <p>The India-China relations have been tense over the past couple of years, with several issues such as the border dispute, economic competition, and the COVID-19 pandemic affecting diplomatic ties. Amidst this backdrop, the Chinese government had refused to renew the visas of Indian journalists working in China, leading to concerns about press freedom and the ability of Indian newspapers to cover developments in China objectively.</p>
  <p>On August 17, 2021, the MEA issued a statement saying that the matter had been taken up with the Chinese side, and that China has "informed that the journalists concerned can continue to stay in China for the time being."</p>
  <p>The statement did not specify the duration of the extension, but it is expected that it will be for some months, until the journalists can return to India for visa renewal.</p>
  <h2>Some examples with case studies</h2>
  <p>The denial of visa renewals to Indian journalists in China has been a contentious issue for some time. In May 2020, the China Daily, a state-run newspaper, had reported that the Chinese government was considering expelling Indian journalists based in China, in retaliation for India's decision to expel journalists from the China Daily and the China Global Television Network (CGTN) over allegations of spreading fake news and disinformation.</p>
  <p>However, the Indian government had denied that it had taken any such decision and had maintained that it was committed to press freedom and the free flow of information.</p>
  <p>Earlier this year, in March, the visas of several Indian journalists in China had expired, and they had been asked to return to India for renewal. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the travel restrictions in place, the journalists were unable to travel to India, leading to fears that they would not be able to return to China and would lose their jobs.</p>
  <p>Some of the affected journalists had taken to social media and other platforms to highlight their plight and seek the intervention of the Indian government.</p>
