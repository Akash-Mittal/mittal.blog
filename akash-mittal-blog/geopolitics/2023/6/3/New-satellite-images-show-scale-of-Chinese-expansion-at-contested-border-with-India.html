   <p>The Chinese-Indian border conflict has been ongoing for decades, with both sides claiming rights to various territories along the Himalayan frontier. The latest development in this ongoing dispute is the revelation of new satellite images that clearly depict China's massive expansion in the region.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Chinese Expansion</h2>
   <p>The new satellite images reveal that China has been constructing new roads, military bases, and other infrastructure near the contested border with India. This has led to increased tensions between the two nations, with both sides accusing each other of violating territorial agreements.</p>
   <p>One of the most significant examples of Chinese expansion is the Doklam plateau, which is located near the border between China and Bhutan. China has been constructing a new road in this area, which India has objected to, as it would give China easier access to India's northeastern states.</p>
   <p>Another example of Chinese expansion is the construction of a new military base in Gyari, which is located near the border with India. The base is believed to be part of China's effort to strengthen its military presence in the region.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <p>The Chinese-Indian border conflict has led to several violent incidents over the years. One of the most notable was the 1962 war between the two countries, which was sparked by a territorial dispute in the Himalayan region. China emerged victorious from the conflict, and India was forced to cede several territories to its neighbor.</p>
   <p>Another significant incident was the 2017 Doklam standoff, which was sparked by China's construction of a road near the disputed border. Indian troops intervened, and the standoff lasted for more than two months before both sides agreed to withdraw their troops.</p>
