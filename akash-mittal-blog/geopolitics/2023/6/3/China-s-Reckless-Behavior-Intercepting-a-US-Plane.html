   <h2>The Story</h2>
   <p>On May 17, 2021, a Chinese fighter jet intercepted a US Navy P-8A Poseidon surveillance plane over the South China Sea. This was the second such incident in less than a month. The US Department of Defense described the Chinese behavior as "unsafe and unprofessional," and called for China to "cease these activities immediately."</p>
   <h2>Examples</h2>
   <p>This incident is just the latest example of China's increasingly aggressive behavior towards the United States. Here are some other recent cases:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>In September 2020, a Chinese fighter jet flew within 100 feet of a US reconnaissance plane over the Yellow Sea.</li>
    <li>In July 2020, China launched multiple missiles into the South China Sea, including one that landed within 20 miles of the US outpost on Guam.</li>
    <li>In June 2020, Chinese soldiers attacked Indian troops with rocks and batons along a disputed border in the Himalayas.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <p>China's aggressive behavior is not limited to military encounters, it also extends to economic and diplomatic realms. Here are two examples:</p>
   <h3>Case Study 1: Australia</h3>
   <p>In November 2020, China suspended imports of Australian wine, barley, and other products in retaliation for Australia's calls for an independent inquiry into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. The suspension cost Australian businesses billions of dollars.</p>
   <h3>Case Study 2: Taiwan</h3>
   <p>China has long claimed sovereignty over Taiwan and has used economic pressure to isolate the island from the international community. In May 2021, China cut off economic talks with Lithuania after the country allowed Taiwan to open a diplomatic office in its capital.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>China's reckless behavior towards the United States and other countries is a cause for concern. The United States and its allies must take steps to deter China from engaging in such behavior and ensure that it respects international law and norms.</p>
