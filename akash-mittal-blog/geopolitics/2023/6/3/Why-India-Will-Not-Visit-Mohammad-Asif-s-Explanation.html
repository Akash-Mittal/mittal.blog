  <p>Cricket is a Game of uncertainties, where teams fight for glory and champions fight for their crown. But, Some Times, the politics of a country or board gets into the way. The recent example is of India's cricket team not visiting Pakistan for any bilateral tour since 2007. The situation has not changed, and according to Mohammad Asif, it won't be changing any time soon. In this article, We will analyze Mohammad Asif's explanation and why India will not be visiting Pakistan anytime soon.</p>
  <h2>Example of Politics in Cricket:</h2>
  <p>Cricket is a sport that has always been marred with politics, where the boards from different countries play a significant role. One of the most prominent examples of this is the ongoing conflict between India and Pakistan. The two countries have been at loggerheads since 1947, and the situation has not changed much even today.</p>
  <h3>Case Study:</h3>
  <p>In 2007, Pakistan was scheduled to host India for a bilateral series, but due to the terror attacks in Mumbai, India, the tour was canceled. Since then, India has not toured Pakistan for any bilateral series. However, The two countries have met in the ICC tournaments and Asia Cup, but the series they had before 2007 has not been repeated.</p>
  <h2>Mohammad Asif's Explanation:</h2>
  <p>In 2020, the former Pakistani cricketer, Mohammad Asif, spoke to a media outlet about the tension between the two countries and the reason for India not visiting Pakistan. According to Asif, the primary reason for India not visiting Pakistan is their board and their politics. He states that India's BCCI gets much more money than PCB, and as such, they are in a position of power. The Players' Associations in India are also much stronger than the ones in Pakistan. Therefore, the Indian players have more say when it comes to playing abroad.</p>
  <p>Asif also stated that India is currently playing more cricket than they used to and are also making more money out of it. Therefore, they are not interested in playing against Pakistan as they don't see any economic benefits from it. He said that it would only be possible if the two countries can resolve their differences and come together.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, the political tensions between India and Pakistan have majorly affected their cricketing relations. According to Mohammad Asif, the primary reason for India not visiting Pakistan is their board's financial status and politics. India's BCCI is financially more comfortable than PCB, which makes them less interested in playing in Pakistan.</p>
