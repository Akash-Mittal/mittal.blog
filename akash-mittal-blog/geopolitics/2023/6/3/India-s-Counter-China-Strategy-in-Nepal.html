    <p>Once upon a time, there was a small Himalayan nation- Nepal. Nepal, a strategic nation between India and China, is becoming a battleground for influence between the two Asian giants in recent years.</p>
    <p>China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has made significant inroads into Nepal through infrastructure projects, but India has responded with its own development assistance programs in the country. India's counter-China strategy in Nepal involves enhancing bilateral ties and addressing Nepali security concerns, infrastructure development, cultural diplomacy, and people-to-people engagement.</p>
    <h2>Examples of India's Counter-China Strategy in Nepal</h2>
    <h3>Case Study 1: Infrastructure Development</h3>
    <p>India has been working towards reforming infrastructure in Nepal, focusing on roadways, railway lines, power transmission lines, and cross-border connectivity. One of the significant projects initiated by India is the construction of ICP (Integrated Check Post) at Birgunj-Raxaul border. It is one of South Asia's largest trading centers and provides importers and exporters with a vast range of facilities, including customs, inspections, and logistics. The check post is primarily designed to reduce transit time and cost, thus improving bilateral trade.</p>
    <h3>Case Study 2: Cultural Diplomacy</h3>
    <p>India's counter-China strategy also includes cultural diplomacy. India's projection of soft power by popularizing Indian goods such as films, cuisine, music, and literature, has a considerable impact on Nepali populations. India has also been dealing with the Nepalese tourism sector to promote cultural tourism and to attract more tourists to India. Indian Cultural Centre in Kathmandu has also played a crucial role in promoting Indian culture and language.</p>
    <h3>Case Study 3: People-to-people Engagement</h3>
    <p>India's counter-China strategy in Nepal also involves people-to-people engagement. India is promoting tourism, educational exchange, and matrimonial exchange programs to strengthen ties between the two nations. It is implementing various scholarships for Nepali students and professionals to study in India and is also open to Nepali students' participation through its prestigious IIT entrance examination.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>It is clear that India is playing a proactive role in Nepal to counter China's growing influence in the region. Through a series of carefully thought-out measures such as infrastructure development, cultural diplomacy, and people-to-people engagement, India is enhancing its footprint in Nepal. Moreover, India's counter-China strategy is not only limited to Nepal but is also being implemented in other countries such as Sri Lanka, Bhutan, and Bangladesh. This implies that India remains committed to maintaining its supremacy in South Asia and curbing China's efforts to expand its influence beyond its borders.</p>
