   <p>Journalism is one of the pillars of a democratic society, and the freedom and safety of journalists are of utmost importance. However, in recent years, the Chinese government has increasingly restricted foreign journalists, including those from India.</p>

   <h2>The Current Situation</h2>
   <p>In 2020, China expelled at least 13 journalists from three major U.S. newspapers—the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal—as well as a French reporter in retaliation for the U.S. government's decision to limit visas for Chinese journalists. In addition, many Indian journalists and news organizations have reported difficulties in obtaining visas and other permissions to work in China.</p>
   <h2>The Importance of Journalistic Freedom</h2>
   <p>The freedom of journalists to report the truth is crucial to a functioning democracy. Without it, corruption and abuse of power can go unchecked, and ordinary citizens are left uninformed.</p>
   <h3>Case Study: The Coronavirus Outbreak</h3>
   <p>During the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak in China, the Chinese government initially tried to suppress information about the virus and punish whistleblowers. However, because of brave reporting by journalists from China and other countries, the truth eventually came out, and the world was able to respond more effectively.</p>
   <h3>Case Study: Elections in India</h3>
   <p>In a recent Indian election, journalists uncovered evidence of vote buying and other forms of election fraud. Thanks to their reporting, the Indian public was made aware of these issues, and steps were taken to address them.</p>
   <h2>The Need for Continued Journalistic Presence in China</h2>
   <p>Despite the challenges and risks, it is important for Indian journalists to be able to report on China and its policies. Not only does this allow for a fuller picture of the region to emerge, but it also promotes transparency and accountability on the part of the Chinese government.</p>
   <h3>Conclusions</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>The freedom of journalists to report the truth is crucial to a functioning democracy.</li>
