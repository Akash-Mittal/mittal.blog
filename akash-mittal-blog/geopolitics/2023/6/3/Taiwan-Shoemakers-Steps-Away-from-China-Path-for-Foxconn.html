    <p>Once a hub for shoe manufacturing, Taiwan had a tough time competing with China in the last few decades. However, some savvy shoemakers from Taiwan have recently taken a bold step and moved their production out of mainland China, citing rising labor and production costs, as well as concerns over geopolitical risks. This move has not only helped the companies reduce their operational costs but also allowed them to maintain their competitive edge by delivering products faster and in a more reliable manner.</p>

    <h2>Examples with Case Studies</h2>
    <p>To put things into perspective, let us take the example of Feng Tay Enterprises, a leading footwear manufacturer. In 2017, the company announced that it would shift 40% of its production from China to Taiwan and Southeast Asia. The move was driven by Feng Tay's desire to reduce inventory, trim lead times, and increase flexibility in terms of production planning. The decision has paid off well for the company, as it has reported higher margins and better operational efficiency since the relocation.</p>
    <p>Another example is Pou Chen, the world's largest contract manufacturer of branded athletic and casual footwear. The company, which has long relied on low-cost labor in China, has recently diversified its production bases to Vietnam, Indonesia, and Mexico. Pou Chen's CEO, Edward Yassin, cited rising labor costs and the ongoing trade tensions between China and the US as the reasons for the move. As a result, the company now has a more resilient supply chain that is better able to weather external shocks.</p>
    <p>These are just a few examples, but they illustrate how companies can benefit from diversifying their production bases and moving away from China. Not only does it reduce their dependence on a single country, but it also helps them maintain their competitive edge by providing more reliable and flexible supply chains.</p>
