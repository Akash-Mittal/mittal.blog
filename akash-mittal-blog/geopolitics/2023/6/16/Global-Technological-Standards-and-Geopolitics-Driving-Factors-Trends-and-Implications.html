  <p>As we step into a new decade of the 21st century, the world is witnessing a massive shift in the global economy and technological landscape. The rapid pace of technological advancements and the growing need for standardization and interoperability are leading to the fierce competition among nations and corporations for shaping the future of the global digital architecture. The outcomes of this silent tussle will likely determine the course of the digital era and the distribution of power and influence in the decades to come.</p>
  <p>The emergence of new technologies such as 5G, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT) is driving the demand for new global technological standards that enable seamless communication, secure data transmission, and efficient resource allocation. At the same time, the lack of common standards and the proliferation of proprietary and conflicting ones pose significant challenges and risks for global interoperability, security, and innovation.</p>
  <p>This article aims to shed light on the driving factors, trends, and implications of the global technological standards and geopolitics, with a focus on three key points:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>The strategic importance of standards and the emerging powers: How the standardization of technology is becoming a new arena for geopolitical competition and how emerging powers from Asia and Europe are challenging the dominance of the US-led international standards.</li>
   <li>The role of corporations and consortia in setting standards: How commercial interests and competition shape the standardization landscape and how private initiatives such as consortia and open-source communities are challenging traditional standardization bodies.</li>
   <li>The risks, challenges, and opportunities of the global standardization: How conflicting standards, fragmentation, and cybersecurity threats create risks and challenges for global interoperability and how collaboration, alignment, and innovation can unlock opportunities for a better digital future.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>From the VHS vs. Betamax to the US vs. China: The Strategic Importance of Standards</h2>
  <p>The importance of global technological standards is not a new phenomenon. It dates back to the early days of mass media and the battle between two competing video cassette formats: the VHS (Video Home System) and the Betamax. The VHS eventually won the race, not because it was technically superior, but because it enjoyed wider industry support and lower costs.</p>
  <p>Fast forward to today, the stakes are much higher, and the competition is much fiercer. The ongoing trade war between the US and China, which involves the race for 5G supremacy, is a defining and highly publicized example of the strategic importance of standards in the digital age. The US has long been the dominant player in setting international standards through organizations such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).</p>
  <p>However, China, which is set to become the largest economy in the world, has been ramping up its efforts to challenge the US-led regime and promote its own standards, such as the proposed New IP (Internet Protocol) for next-generation internet infrastructure. China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has also been instrumental in spreading its digital connectivity standards to other countries, even as the US has been advocating for its own standards, such as the Clean Network program.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, Europe, which has been traditionally a standardization powerhouse, is also seeking to assert its influence by promoting its own digital sovereignty and standards on issues such as data protection, cybersecurity, and AI ethics.</p>
  <h3>Case Study: The Battle for 5G Standards</h3>
  <p>The race for 5G standards is a prime example of how global technological standards have become a new arena for geopolitical competition. At the heart of this race lies the question of which technology will dominate the future wireless communications and enable new applications such as autonomous driving, smart cities, and virtual reality.</p>
  <p>The US has been pushing for its own standards through a coalition of allies known as the "Clean Network," which aims to exclude Chinese equipment and technologies from critical networks. The US has also been promoting its own 5G standards through the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), a global consortium of telecoms standards bodies. However, the US has faced challenges in persuading its allies to join its campaign, as many countries have already invested in Chinese technologies and fear retaliation from China.</p>
  <p>China, on the other hand, has been promoting its own 5G standards through its state-controlled telecoms giant Huawei, which has invested heavily in research and development and holds a significant share of 5G patents. Huawei's standards, which are based on a different technology known as Time-Division Long-Term Evolution (TD-LTE), have gained support from several countries in Asia, Africa, and Europe, which are either attracted by the lower costs or influenced by China's economic and diplomatic power. However, Huawei's ambitions have also faced backlash from the US and its allies, which claim that Huawei poses a security risk and could allow Chinese spying.</p>
  <h2>From ISO to Github: The Role of Corporations and Consortia in Setting Standards</h2>
  <p>The emergence of new technologies and the growing demand for rapid innovation and customization have challenged the traditional models of standardization led by intergovernmental organizations and national bodies. While these traditional bodies still play a crucial role in setting the broad guidelines and principles of global standards, they are increasingly being complemented and even challenged by private initiatives driven by corporate interests and competition.</p>
  <p>Large corporations, particularly those in the tech sector, have been active in defining and shaping technological standards that suit their own business and market strategies. These standards can provide a competitive edge by ensuring interoperability with their own products, reducing development costs, and influencing the market dynamics. For example, Apple's Lightning connector, which is unique to its products, has been a source of controversy and complaint, as it requires separate cables and adapters from those used by other devices.</p>
  <p>In addition to individual corporations, consortia and open-source communities have emerged as significant players in standardization, particularly in areas such as cloud computing, blockchain, and the IoT. These initiatives bring together multiple stakeholders from academia, industry, and governmental organizations and provide a collaborative and agile approach to standardization, which can bypass the bureaucracy and political hurdles of traditional bodies.</p>
  <h3>Case Study: The Battle for Blockchain Standards</h3>
  <p>The blockchain technology, which underpins cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, has been touted as a transformative innovation with applications ranging from finance, supply chain, and identity management to smart contracts and voting systems. However, the lack of standardization and interoperability has been a major obstacle to its widespread adoption and scalability.</p>
  <p>A multitude of blockchain platforms and protocols exist, each with its own features, consensus mechanisms, and programming languages. This fragmentation has created challenges for developers, users, and regulators, who struggle to understand and navigate the different options.</p>
  <p>To address this issue, several consortia and open-source communities have emerged to promote blockchain standardization and interoperability. For instance, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) brings together over 300 member organizations to define open-source standards for Ethereum-based blockchain technologies. The Hyperledger Project, hosted by the Linux Foundation, aims to develop a cross-industry open-source blockchain platform that can be customized and integrated with different systems and architectures.</p>
  <h2>From Risks to Opportunities: The Future of Global Standardization</h2>
  <p>While the competition and conflicts over global technological standards can create risks and challenges for interoperability, resilience, and security, they can also open up opportunities for collaboration, alignment, and innovation. The following trends and strategies are key to unlocking the potential of global standardization:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Collaboration and alignment: As new technologies emerge and existing ones evolve, it is essential to foster multi-stakeholder collaboration and alignment on common standards and interoperability frameworks. This requires open dialogue, transparent processes, and shared governance among different actors in the global digital ecosystem, including governments, industry, civil society, and technical bodies.</li>
   <li>Innovation and experimentation: The rapid pace of technological change and the diversity of societal needs and wants require flexible and adaptive approaches to standardization. Innovation and experimentation, driven by private initiatives and open-source communities, can enable the discovery of new standards that reflect the evolving demands of the users and the market.</li>
   <li>Cybersecurity and risk management: The growing interconnectivity and dependence on digital technologies also create new vulnerabilities and threats to security and privacy. Standardization needs to address these risks by incorporating robust cybersecurity and risk management measures that are context-specific, dynamic, and compliant with legal and ethical norms.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Case Study: The Rise of Open Standards and the Internet of Things</h3>
  <p>The Internet of Things (IoT), which refers to the interconnection of physical devices and sensors through the internet, is a prime example of the need for open standards and interoperability. The IoT ecosystem involves a diverse range of devices, protocols, and applications, each with its own characteristics and requirements. The lack of common standards and protocols can lead to fragmentation, complexity, and security risks.</p>
  <p>To address this issue, several open standards initiatives have emerged in recent years. One of the most notable ones is the Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF), a consortium of more than 300 companies that develop and promote open standards for IoT interoperability. The OCF's standards enable devices to discover, communicate, and exchange data securely and seamlessly across different platforms and technologies.</p>
  <p>The OCF's approach represents a shift towards more collaborative, user-centric, and open-source models of standardization, which can enhance innovation, interoperability, and security in the rapidly evolving digital landscape.</p>
