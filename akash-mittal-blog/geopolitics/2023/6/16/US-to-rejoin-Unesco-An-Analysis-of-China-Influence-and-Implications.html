  <p>According to the recent announcement made by Unesco, the United States is planning to rejoin the UN cultural and scientific agency, and pay over $600 million in back dues from July. This decision comes as a move to check China's growing influence in the international organization, which has been a matter of concern for some time now. In this article, we will delve deeper into the influence of China on Unesco and the implications of US rejoining the organization.</p>
  <h2>China's Growing Influence in Unesco</h2>
  <p>China has been actively pushing for its candidates for leadership positions in various United Nations organizations, including Unesco. The influence of China is also reflected in the funding pattern of Unesco, where the country has gradually increased its contribution to the organization over the years. In 2017, China became the second-largest contributor to Unesco's regular budget, only after the United States.</p>
  <p>The impact of China's influence on Unesco can be seen in various decisions made by the organization, such as retaining Tibet's traditional cuisine as Chinese, despite the region being an autonomous region of China, which has led to criticism of Unesco's credibility.</p>
  <h2>Implications of US Rejoining Unesco</h2>
  <p>The decision of the United States to rejoin Unesco has significant implications for both the organization and the international community. It can lead to the restoration of the credibility of the organization, which has been under scrutiny for some time due to its controversies and shortcomings.</p>
  <p>In addition, US rejoining Unesco can help in the promotion of American values and interests in the international community, which can challenge China's growing influence in the organization. The US can play a leading role in shaping the agenda of Unesco and ensure the protection of cultural and heritage sites globally.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The decision of the United States to rejoin Unesco is a positive step towards restoring the credibility of the organization and checking China's influence. With US rejoining, Unesco can become a more inclusive and democratic organization, where decisions are made based on merit rather than influence. The focus of Unesco should remain on protecting cultural and heritage sites worldwide and promoting the values of diversity and inclusivity.</p>
