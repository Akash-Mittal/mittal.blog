   <h2>Interesting Story</h2>
   <p>In 2016, the Indian Air Force conducted a daring cross-border surgical strike on terrorist launch pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The operation, which was highly successful, showcased India's military might and its technological prowess. The US, which had been closely monitoring the situation, was impressed by India's capabilities and the two countries started exploring areas for deeper collaboration in defense.</p>
   <h2>Examples and Case Studies</h2>
   <p>The India-US defense partnership has been steadily growing over the years. In 2018, the US granted India the status of a Major Defense Partner, which opened up new avenues for cooperation in defense trade and technology transfer. The two countries have signed several agreements for joint military exercises, intelligence-sharing, and cooperation in the areas of space and cybersecurity.</p>
   <p>In February 2021, Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin signed a landmark defense agreement that allows the sharing of geospatial intelligence between the two countries. The agreement is expected to enhance India's maritime security and enable better coordination with the US Navy in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
   <p>Some of the ongoing India-US defense projects include:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The Apache and Chinook helicopters deal with Boeing</li>
    <li>The C-17 and C-130J transport aircraft deal with Lockheed Martin</li>
    <li>The Predator and Reaper armed drones deal with General Atomics</li>
    <li>The M777 howitzer artillery gun deal with BAE Systems</li>
   </ul>
   <p>These projects have not only bolstered India's defense capabilities but have also created jobs and technology transfer opportunities for Indian companies.</p>
