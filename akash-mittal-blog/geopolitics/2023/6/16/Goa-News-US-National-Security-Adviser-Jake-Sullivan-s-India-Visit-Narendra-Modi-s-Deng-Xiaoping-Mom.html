  <p></p>
  <p>When Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader of China, visited the US in 1979, he famously declared that "it doesn't matter if a cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice." It was a signal that China was opening up to the world and was willing to embrace capitalism to achieve its lofty ambitions.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Four decades later, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's US visit, scheduled for June 22, is set to be his Deng Xiaoping moment. And US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan's visit to Delhi this week is expected to finalise the agreements that will be unveiled on that day.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The public focus is on major deals to write but the significance of the visit goes far beyond that. India and the US are preparing to take their relationship to a new level as both countries seek to counter the influence of an increasingly assertive China.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In this article, we will explore the three key takeaways from Jake Sullivan's India visit.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. India and the US are aligning their strategic interests</p>
  <p>The Quad, comprising India, the US, Japan and Australia, has emerged as the most important strategic grouping in the region. The four countries are united by their shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific, where countries big and small can pursue their interests without fear of coercion.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>While the Quad has been portrayed as a security alliance to contain China, its members have taken pains to emphasise its positive agenda. The Quad Vaccine Partnership, for instance, has promised to deliver one billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines to countries in the region by 2022.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Jake Sullivan's visit is expected to lay the groundwork for a successful Quad summit later this year, which will showcase the grouping's efforts to promote inclusive economic development, infrastructure investment and digital technology.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. India and the US are deepening economic ties</p>
  <p>The US is India's second-largest trading partner, but bilateral trade has been hampered by longstanding irritants such as intellectual property rights, market access and tariffs.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Jake Sullivan's visit is expected to result in several breakthrough agreements in this area. The two sides are reportedly close to finalising a trade package that could pave the way for a larger Free Trade Agreement.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The US is also keen to help India shore up its supply chain resilience in the wake of the pandemic. Initiatives such as the US International Development Finance Corporation's $1 billion fund to invest in critical infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific could provide a boost to India's manufacturing sector.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. India and the US are strengthening defence cooperation</p>
  <p>The US is India's largest defence supplier, and the two countries have signed several defence agreements over the years. However, there is scope for deeper cooperation to counter China's growing military assertiveness in the region.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Jake Sullivan's visit is expected to result in progress on several defence deals, including the acquisition of US drones by the Indian Navy. The two sides are also set to establish a permanent working group on defence to enhance coordination and collaboration.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion:</p>
  <p>Jake Sullivan's India visit is a significant milestone in the India-US relationship. The two countries are aligning their strategic interests, deepening economic ties and strengthening defence cooperation, all with an eye on countering China's growing influence.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The visit also highlights the potential of the Quad to provide a positive, forward-looking agenda for the region, one that seeks to promote inclusive economic growth and regional stability.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>As Prime Minister Modi heads to Washington later this month, he will be seeking to build on the momentum generated by Jake Sullivan's visit and cement India's strategic partnership with the US.</p>
