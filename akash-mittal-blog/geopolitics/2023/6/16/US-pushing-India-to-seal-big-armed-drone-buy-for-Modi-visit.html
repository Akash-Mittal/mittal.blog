  <p>Before Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's state visit to Washington, the Biden administration is urging New Delhi to close a deal for dozens of US-made armed drones, according to two people familiar with the situation.</p>
  <h2>An interesting story</h2>
  <p>The United States is one of the world's largest arms exporters, and India is one of the fastest-growing markets for military equipment. The two nations have a strategic partnership that includes defence cooperation, with the United States becoming a significant supplier of defence equipment to India.</p>
  <p>Armed drones are the latest addition to the US-India defence cooperation agenda. The Indian military has been using unarmed drones for surveillance and reconnaissance purposes; however, it seeks to expand its capabilities by acquiring armed drones.</p>
  <h2>Case studies</h2>
  <h3>India's current drone capabilities</h3>
  <p>At present, India employs several unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for surveillance and reconnaissance. The Indian military has used UAVs such as the Israeli Heron, Searcher Mark II, and Harpy for military operations. However, these drones are unarmed and are used primarily for imaging, mapping, and monitoring.</p>
  <h3>US drone technology</h3>
  <p>The United States, on the other hand, has advanced drone technology that is being used for both reconnaissance and missile attacks. The United States uses drones such as the MQ-9 Reaper and the Avenger for military operations globally. These drones have the capability of firing missiles from a distance and can conduct targeted strikes on enemy positions.</p>
  <h3>Pakistan's armed drone capabilities</h3>
  <p>India's regional rival, Pakistan, has already acquired armed drones from China. The Pakistan Air Force has been successfully using the Chinese-built CH-4 armed drones for military operations against Taliban targets in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) in Pakistan.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>India's acquisition of armed drones from the United States is seen as a significant step towards strengthening Indo-US defence cooperation. Arming India with drones will allow it to conduct surgical strikes on terrorist targets and strengthen its anti-terrorism and anti-insurgency capabilities.</p>
  <p>The United States, on the other hand, will further its strategic goals in the region and bolster its position as India's main defence partner. However, concerns remain over the potential misuse of drone technology by non-state actors, and proper safeguards must be put in place to prevent this from happening.</p>
