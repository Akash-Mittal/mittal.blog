   <p>Have you ever wondered how your smartphone, laptop or electric car are made? One essential component required to manufacture these devices are rare earth minerals. Rare earths are a group of 17 elements found in the earth's crust, and despite their name, they are not actually rare. However, they are difficult to extract and process, which makes them valuable and in high demand.</p>
   <p>Rare earths have become a critical resource in today's modern society, used in a range of technologies from wind turbines and electric cars to medical devices and defense systems. Their importance has not gone unnoticed by the G20 countries, who collectively account for 75% of global rare earth production and consumption.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Rare Earth Minerals in Technology</h2>
   <p>To illustrate the importance of rare earths in technology, let's take a look at some examples:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Neodymium is used in the production of powerful magnets, which are found in wind turbines and electric motors.</li>
    <li>Europium is used to create the red phosphor in the screens of smartphones and televisions.</li>
    <li>Yttrium is used in the production of camera lenses, flat-panel displays, and LEDs.</li>
    <li>Lanthanum is used in rechargeable batteries for hybrid and electric cars.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <p>Let's take a closer look at some case studies of rare earth use in technology:</p>
   <h3>Electric Vehicles in China</h3>
   <p>China is the world's largest producer of rare earths, and they have been using this advantage to drive the development of electric vehicles. Rare earths are used in the manufacture of batteries and the magnets needed for electric drives. China has set a goal to produce at least 2 million electric cars per year by 2020, and rare earths will play a crucial role in this effort.</p>
   <h3>Wind Turbines in Europe</h3>
   <p>Europe is the world's leader in wind energy, with wind turbines accounting for 18% of the region's total electricity production. Rare earths are used in the production of the magnets which make the turbines more efficient. The development of the wind energy industry in Europe would not have been possible without the availability of rare earths in countries such as China, which supply over 90% of the world's rare earths.</p>
   <h3>Smartphones in Japan</h3>
   <p>Japan is a leader in the production of smartphones, which rely on rare earths for a range of components including the screens and the camera lenses. Japan has been investing in the development of new technologies to reduce the dependence on rare earths from China, including recycling and using substitutes where possible.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion - 3 Key Points</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Rare earths are key components in technological devices used in the G20 economies, including electric vehicles, wind turbines and smartphones.</li>
    <li>The G20 economies account for 75% of global rare earth production and consumption, making them critical players in the industry.</li>
    <li>The sustainability of rare earth mining and processing should be a key consideration for the G20 countries, to ensure a secure and resilient supply of these critical minerals for the future.</li>

    <p>Have you ever thought about how much technology you use every day? From phones and laptops to cars and green energy, these products have become an integral part of our daily lives. But did you know that these technologies rely heavily on rare earth elements (REEs)?</p>
    <p>REEs are a group of 17 chemical elements that are essential for the production of many high-tech products, including electric vehicles, wind turbines, and smartphones. Despite their importance, REEs are often overlooked due to their scarcity and geopolitical challenges. According to the US Geological Survey, China produces over 80% of the world's REEs, making the world vulnerable to supply-side disruptions.</p>
    <p>The reliance on China for REEs has become a concern for many countries, especially the G20 nations. In response, the G20 has taken a proactive approach to ensure the resilience of REE supply chains.</p>
    <h2>Examples of REEs in Technology</h2>
    <p>REEs play a vital role in the production of green energy technologies, including wind turbines and electric vehicle batteries. For example, wind turbines require neodymium, dysprosium, and praseodymium to produce the magnets that generate power. Similarly, electric vehicle batteries rely on lanthanum and cerium to increase energy efficiency and reduce emissions.</p>
    <p>REEs are also found in our daily devices, such as smartphones and laptops. Smartphones contain up to 16 different REEs, including yttrium, europium, and gadolinium, which are used in the production of touchscreens, speakers, and displays. Laptops contain REEs such as terbium and erbium, which are essential for the production of lighting and optical fibers.</p>
    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>The vulnerability of REE supply chains was highlighted in a 2010 dispute between China and Japan. China, which is the leading producer of REEs, tightened export quotas of REEs, causing the price of these commodities to surge globally. Japan, which is reliant on these REEs for its technology, was forced to seek alternative suppliers to maintain production.</p>
    <p>Another example is the Mountain Pass mine in California, which was once the leading producer of REEs outside of China. The mine was shut down in 2002 due to environmental concerns and cheaper imports from China. In 2018, the mine reopened due to concerns over Chinese export restrictions and tariffs on US goods. The reopening of the mine represents the US's effort to reduce its reliance on Chinese REEs.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The G20 recognizes the importance of REEs and their position in the global supply chain. REEs are essential for many high-tech products that we use every day, and their scarcity and geopolitical challenges make them vulnerable to disruptions. To ensure the resilience of REE supply chains, the G20 must take a proactive approach.</p>
    <p>Here are three key takeaways:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Develop alternative sources of REEs to reduce reliance on China</li>
     <li>Invest in research and development to find substitutes for REEs or ways to use them more efficiently</li>
     <li>Form partnerships to promote the responsible and sustainable production of REEs.</li>
    </ol>
