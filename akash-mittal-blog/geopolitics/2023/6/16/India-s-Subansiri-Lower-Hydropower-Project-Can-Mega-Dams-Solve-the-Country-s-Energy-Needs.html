  <h1>India's Subansiri Lower Hydropower Project: Can Mega Dams Solve the Country's Energy Needs?</h1></br> <img src="images/India-s-Subansiri-Lower-Hydropower-Project-Can-Mega-Dams-Solve-the-Country-s-Energy-Needs.jpeg" alt="+India-s-Subansiri-Lower-Hydropower-Project-Can-Mega-Dams-Solve-the-Country-s-Energy-Needs+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.business-standard.com/economy/news/india-gears-up-to-start-mega-hydropower-project-near-china-border-123061300291_1.html" target="_blank" href="https://www.business-standard.com/economy/news/india-gears-up-to-start-mega-hydropower-project-near-china-border-123061300291_1.html" rel="noopener">https://www.business-standard.com/economy/news/india-gears-up-to-start-mega-hydropower-project-near-china-border-123061300291_1.html</a></span></h5>
  <p>The Subansiri Lower project is one of India's ambitious hydropower projects that aims to generate electricity by harnessing the Subansiri River. This run-of-the-river project, which is being built by NHPC, aims to generate 2,000 MW of power and will be one of the largest dams in the country when it is completed. The project comes at a price of Rs 20,469 crore and will take around six years to complete.</p>
  <h2>The Challenges of Mega Dams</h2>
  <p>While mega dams like Subansiri Lower are seen as a panacea for India's power needs, they come with their own set of challenges and controversies. There are concerns about the environmental impact, displacement of local communities, and the economic viability of such projects.</p>
  <p>For instance, a report by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in 2019 highlighted the environmental concerns associated with the hydropower projects in the Himalayan region, where Subansiri Lower is being built. The report noted that hydropower projects can cause irreversible damage to the environment and lead to the loss of biodiversity and forests.</p>
  <p>Moreover, the construction of mega dams often leads to the displacement of local communities, who are often not adequately compensated or relocated. In the case of Subansiri Lower, there were protests by the local communities who were demanding better compensation and rehabilitation.</p>
  <p>Another challenge with mega dams is their economic viability. Many mega dams have faced cost overruns and delays, which have made them unviable in the long run. For example, the Sardar Sarovar Dam in Gujarat, which is one of the largest dams in the country, faced cost overruns of over Rs 10,000 crore, which has made the project financially unviable.</p>
  <h2>Case Study: The Narmada Dam Controversy</h2>
  <p>The controversy surrounding the Narmada dam is a case in point for the challenges associated with mega dams. The Narmada Dam project, which is one of the largest dams in India, faced widespread protests and controversy over its environmental impact and displacement of local communities.</p>
  <p>The Narmada Valley Development Authority (NVDA), which is responsible for the project, claimed that the dam would provide irrigation, electricity, and drinking water to millions of people in the region. However, the project faced opposition from environmentalists and local communities who argued that the dam would lead to the displacement of over 200,000 people and cause irreparable damage to the environment.</p>
  <p>The controversy surrounding the Narmada dam project led to the formation of the Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA), a social movement that aimed to protect the rights of the local communities and the environment. The NBA filed a case in the Supreme Court of India, which resulted in a landmark judgment that established the right of local communities to be informed, consulted, and compensated in case of displacement due to development projects.</p>
  <h2>Mega Dams: The Way Forward?</h2>
  <p>While mega dams like Subansiri Lower may offer a solution to India's power needs, it is important to weigh the environmental, social, and economic costs associated with such projects. It is crucial to ensure that the local communities are adequately compensated and relocated, and their rights are protected. Moreover, it is essential to assess the long-term economic viability of such projects and take steps to mitigate the environmental impact.</p>
  <p>At the same time, it is essential to explore alternative sources of energy such as wind, solar, and tidal power, which are more environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive. These sources of energy are also becoming increasingly affordable, which makes them more attractive from an economic perspective.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The Subansiri Lower hydropower project is one of India's ambitious projects that aims to generate electricity using the power of the Subansiri River. While these mega dams may offer a solution to India's power needs, it is crucial to weigh the environmental, social, and economic costs associated with these projects. It is also important to explore alternative sources of energy that are more sustainable and socially inclusive.</p>
