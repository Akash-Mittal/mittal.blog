  <h1>An Oil Trade Story: How Pakistan and Russia's Business Relationship is Blossoming</h1></br> <img src="images/Russian-Oil-Shipment-Arrives-in-Pakistan-Foreign-Policy.jpeg" alt="+Russian-Oil-Shipment-Arrives-in-Pakistan-Foreign-Policy+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/06/14/pakistan-russia-crude-oil-shipment-india-ukraine-global-south/" target="_blank" href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/06/14/pakistan-russia-crude-oil-shipment-india-ukraine-global-south/" rel="noopener">https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/06/14/pakistan-russia-crude-oil-shipment-india-ukraine-global-south/</a></span></h5>
  <p>It was a sunny day in April, and the port of Karachi in Pakistan was bustling with activity. A large fire-red tanker from Russia had arrived and was being greeted by the locals. The ship was carrying a precious cargo – tons of oil that was to be used to fuel the power plants and generators. It was a historic moment for Pakistan, as it marked the first time that the country was receiving oil from Russia.</p>
  <p>The journey to this moment was long and riddled with obstacles. It wasn't until a few years ago that Pakistan started looking at Russia as a potential partner in the oil trade. Over the years, Pakistan had heavily relied on Arab countries to source its oil from. However, the geopolitical situation in the region was fragile, which created a need for Pakistan to look for other sources of oil. Around the same time, Russia was looking to expand its oil market and sought out new partners in Asia.</p>
  <p>The relationship between Pakistan and Russia wasn't always cordial, and there were times when the two countries were on opposite sides of global issues. However, as both countries started making concerted efforts to foster their relationship, new avenues for cooperation emerged.</p>
  <h2>The Growing Business Partnership</h2>
  <p>The oil trade isn't the only area where Pakistan and Russia are fostering their partnership. Over the past few years, there has been a significant uptick in trade between the two countries. In 2020, Pakistan and Russia signed a bilateral trade agreement worth $10 billion, which included cooperation in sectors like energy, agriculture, and technology.</p>
  <p>Pakistan is looking to Russia to help build its energy infrastructure. With a rapidly growing population, Pakistan is facing an energy deficit and has been looking to import electricity and gas from neighboring countries. Russia has already supplied Pakistan with two nuclear reactors, and discussions are underway to explore the possibility of building a gas pipeline between the two countries.</p>
  <h2>Case Study: The Karot Hydropower Project</h2>
  <p>The Karot Hydropower Project is a testament to the growing partnership between Pakistan and Russia. The project is being developed by a Chinese company and is funded by several banks, including the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the Silk Road Fund. However, the turbines being used in the project are being supplied by a Russian company, Power Machines.</p>
  <p>The Karot project is expected to generate 720 MW of electricity and will help alleviate Pakistan's energy crisis. It is also significant because it is the first time that a Russian company has been involved in a hydroelectric project in Pakistan.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The relationship between Pakistan and Russia is on the upswing, and the oil trade is just one aspect of their growing partnership. Both countries are looking to expand their business ties, and there is immense potential for cooperation in sectors like energy, agriculture, and technology. The growing partnership between Pakistan and Russia is not only good news for both countries but also for the larger region.</p>
