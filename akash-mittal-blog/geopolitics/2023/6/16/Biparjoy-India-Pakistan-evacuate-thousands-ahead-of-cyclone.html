  <p>As the world battles with the COVID-19 pandemic, an impending natural disaster has added to the woes of India and Pakistan. The Arabian Sea is brewing up a powerful cyclone named Biparjoy which is expected to make landfall on Thursday evening. Both the countries are bracing themselves for the potential damage that can be caused by Biparjoy. The authorities have already initiated evacuation plans to minimize loss of life and property.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Previous Cyclones</h2>
  <p>Biparjoy is not the first deadly cyclone to hit the region. In May 2020, Cyclone Amphan hit India and Bangladesh causing the deaths of more than 100 people. It was one of the worst cyclones to hit the region in decades. The super cyclone caused widespread damage to infrastructure and agriculture. It also left thousands of people homeless.</p>
  <p>Another devastating cyclone hit Odisha in 2019. Cyclone Fani, a category 4 cyclone, caused the displacement of more than 1.2 million people. The state experienced severe damage to infrastructure, agriculture, and fishing. The total cost of the damage caused by the cyclone was estimated to be around $3 billion.</p>
  <h2>The Evacuation Process</h2>
  <p>The evacuation process in both India and Pakistan is in full swing. The authorities have identified high-risk areas and have relocated the residents to safer locations. The Indian government has deployed the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams in advance to carry out evacuation procedures in the coastal regions. Pakistan has also deployed its army in the coastal areas to assist with the evacuation process.</p>
  <p>The evacuation process is not without challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic has added an additional layer of complexity. The evacuees are being screened for COVID-19 symptoms prior to being relocated. The authorities are taking all precautions to minimize the spread of the virus.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Cyclones are a regular occurrence in the region. However, the intensity and frequency of cyclones have increased in recent years. Climate change is one of the factors that have contributed to the severity of cyclones. It is imperative that the authorities take immediate action to minimize the damage caused by cyclones. The evacuation process implemented by both India and Pakistan is a step in the right direction. However, a lot more needs to be done in terms of developing infrastructure and technology to mitigate the impact of cyclones.</p>
