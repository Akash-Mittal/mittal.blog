  <p>When Yiming (not his real name) first heard about the Beijing LGBT Center, he was hesitant to go there. He had just come out to his family and friends and was looking for a safe and supportive community where he could be himself.</p>
  <p>But after some encouragement from his friends, Yiming visited the center and found it to be a warm and welcoming place where he could connect with others and learn more about LGBTQ issues in China.</p>
  <p>However, Yiming's experience is becoming increasingly rare for China's LGBTQ community.</p>
  <h2>A crackdown on advocacy groups</h2>
  <p>Since Chinese President Xi Jinping came to power in 2013, there has been a crackdown on advocacy groups and civil society organizations that are perceived as a threat to the country's stability and Communist Party rule.</p>
  <p>The Beijing LGBT Center, which was founded in 2008 and provided support, education, and advocacy for LGBTQ people, is among the latest organizations to shut down amid the crackdown.</p>
  <p>The group had been operating in a legal gray area, as LGBTQ advocacy is not explicitly banned in China but is often subject to censorship and restrictions.</p>
  <p>However, in December 2020, the center received a notice from the Beijing Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau stating that it had violated regulations on social organizations and must "cease all activities immediately."</p>
  <p>The center's founder, Fan Popo, said that the decision was a "political move" and that the "government wants to control all social movements in the country."</p>
  <h2>The impact on LGBTQ people in China</h2>
  <p>The closure of the Beijing LGBT Center is a significant blow to China's LGBTQ community, which is already facing significant discrimination and stigma.</p>
  <p>According to a survey conducted by the United Nations Development Programme and the Beijing LGBT Center in 2019, almost half of LGBTQ people in China have experienced discrimination in the workplace, and only 5 percent feel they can be open about their sexual orientation at work.</p>
  <p>The study also found that 70 percent of LGBTQ people in China feel they have to hide their sexual orientation or gender identity in public, and 60 percent have experienced discrimination in the healthcare system.</p>
  <p>Without access to safe and supportive spaces, LGBTQ people in China are at risk of social isolation, mental health issues, and even violence.</p>
  <h2>Case studies</h2>
  <p>Li, a queer woman living in Chengdu, used to attend events at the Chengdu Rainbow Health Center, which provided healthcare and support services for LGBTQ people. However, the center was forced to shut down in 2018 after it was labeled a "harmful" organization by the government.</p>
  <blockquote>
   "It was heartbreaking to see the center closing down," Li said. "It was the only place where I could meet others like me and feel accepted."
  </blockquote>
  <p>Since the closure of the center, Li has struggled to find supportive communities and has experienced increased anxiety and isolation.</p>
  <p>Zhang, a transgender man living in Beijing, used to attend support groups at the Beijing LGBT Center, where he could connect with other trans people and learn more about gender-affirming healthcare.</p>
  <blockquote>
   "The center was a lifeline for me," Zhang said. "I felt understood and supported there."
  </blockquote>
  <p>Since the closure of the center, Zhang has had difficulty accessing healthcare and has experienced increased dysphoria and depression.</p>
  <h2>The challenges ahead</h2>
  <p>The closure of organizations like the Beijing LGBT Center highlights the challenges faced by China's LGBTQ community and the need for more support and advocacy.</p>
  <p>However, it is not all doom and gloom. Despite the challenges, there are still many LGBTQ organizations and individuals in China who are fighting for equality and visibility.</p>
  <p>In 2020, a group of LGBTQ activists in China launched a social media campaign called #WeNeedAButton, calling for the inclusion of same-sex relationships on popular social networking platforms like Weibo and WeChat.</p>
  <p>The campaign gained significant traction and prompted a debate about LGBTQ visibility in China.</p>
  <p>Moreover, with the growing global awareness and acceptance of LGBTQ rights, there is hope that China will one day follow suit and recognize the importance of supporting its LGBTQ citizens.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The closure of the Beijing LGBT Center is a sobering reminder that LGBTQ people in China still face significant discrimination and lack access to safe spaces and support.</p>
  <p>However, it is also a reminder that there are still many individuals and organizations fighting for LGBTQ rights and visibility in China.</p>
  <p>As the global conversation around LGBTQ issues continues to grow, it is important that we support and uplift these voices and work towards a more inclusive and accepting future for all.</p>
