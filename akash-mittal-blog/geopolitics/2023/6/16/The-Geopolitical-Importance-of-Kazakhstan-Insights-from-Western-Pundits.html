    <p>Kazakhstan, the world's ninth largest country by land area, is often overlooked in the international arena. However, the country's strategic location, natural resources, and political stability make it an important player in the geopolitics of Central Asia. Kazakhstan gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, and since then, has adopted a multi-vector foreign policy, which has allowed it to maintain good relations with both Russia and the West.</p>
    <p>Despite its efforts to diversify its economy and attract foreign investment, Kazakhstan is still heavily dependent on its oil and gas sector, which accounts for more than half of its exports. This dependency, coupled with the country's proximity to Russia and China, as well as its large Muslim population, make Kazakhstan an interesting case study in the current global geopolitical context.</p>

    <h2>Insights from Western Pundits</h2>
    <p>EURACTIV, a media outlet covering EU news and policies, recently spoke to former diplomats who gave a positive assessment of Kazakhstan's cooperation potential with the EU and advised the Union against being overtaken by China, a much more assertive geopolitical player. According to the pundits, the EU needs to strengthen its presence in Central Asia by engaging with countries like Kazakhstan, promoting democratic values, and offering economic incentives for cooperation.</p>
    <p>The pundits also noted that China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) poses a risk to the EU's geopolitical interests in the region. The BRI, a massive infrastructure project that seeks to connect China with Europe, Asia, and Africa through trade and investment, has already made significant inroads in Central Asia, including Kazakhstan. The pundits cautioned that the EU cannot afford to cede its influence to China and must take steps to counter the BRI's impact.</p>
    <p>One of the former diplomats emphasized that global powers often use smaller countries like Kazakhstan as pawns in their geopolitical games, and that the country needs to maintain its independence and sovereignty in order to avoid being caught in the middle of a geopolitical rivalry. He added that Kazakhstan's multi-vector foreign policy has served it well so far, but that the country needs to be cautious in making decisions that may be perceived as taking sides.</p>
