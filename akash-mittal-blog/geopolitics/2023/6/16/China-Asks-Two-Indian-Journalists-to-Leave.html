  <p>On June 22, 2021, China asked two Indian journalists employed with the <em>Indian Express</em> newspaper to leave the country alleging 'unfair treatment' of its own reporters in India. The two journalists, Ananth Krishnan and Atul Aneja, had been working in China for several years and were covering a range of topics including trade and border issues between China and India.</p>
  <p>This decision by China has raised serious concerns about press freedom and the ability of journalists to report objectively on both countries. The move is also seen as another bilateral tension between China and India, which are already engaged in a border standoff in the Himalayas.</p>

   <h2>Examples of Journalists Facing Expulsion or Harassment</h2>
   <p>"Expulsion or harassment of journalists for their reporting is not a new phenomenon, especially in countries where press freedom is limited or under threat," says Rajiv Shah, a media professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Here are some recent examples:</p><strong>Russia:</strong>
   <p>In December 2020, Russia expelled three journalists from the <em>Financial Times</em> and one from the <em>Economist</em> who were investigating a secretive mercenary group with links to the Kremlin.</p><strong>Egypt:</strong>
   <p>In September 2018, authorities in Egypt arrested and detained several journalists, including a correspondent for the <em>Washington Post</em>, who were covering protests against President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's government.</p><strong>Philippines:</strong>
   <p>In May 2020, the Philippines government revoked the license of <em>ABS-CBN</em>, the country's largest broadcast network, after its critical reporting on Duterte's administration.</p>

  <p>The two Indian journalists' expulsion from China has also drawn attention to the treatment of foreign journalists in China, where media is tightly controlled by the state. According to the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China, which represents foreign journalists working in China, those who report on sensitive issues such as Tibet and Xinjiang often face harassment, intimidation, and visa issues.</p>

   <h2>Case Study: Cheng Lei</h2>
   <p>One such case is that of Cheng Lei, an Australian journalist who was detained by Chinese authorities in August 2020 and has been held without trial since then. Cheng, who had been working for China's state-controlled English-language news channel, CGTN, for several years, was taken into custody on suspicion of endangering China's national security.</p>
   <p>Cheng's detention has been widely criticized by media organizations and the Australian government, which has called for her immediate release. Experts say her case is part of China's broader crackdown on critical voices, including journalists, activists, and academics.</p>
  </div>
  <p>China's decision to expel the two Indian journalists has also been criticized by Indian media and government officials. The Indian External Affairs Ministry has said that India believes in freedom of the press and would like to see foreign journalists working in India to be accorded due respect and protection.</p>
  <div class="conclusion">
   <h3>Conclusion</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>The expulsion of Ananth Krishnan and Atul Aneja from China highlights the importance of press freedom and the need for journalists to be allowed to report without fear of retribution or expulsion.</li>
    <li>It also draws attention to the wider issue of limited media freedom in China, where journalists working on sensitive issues face harassment, intimidation, and visa issues.</li>
    <li>The case of Cheng Lei, an Australian journalist who has been detained by Chinese authorities, shows the extent to which China will go to silence critics and maintain control over the media.</li>
   </ul>
  </div>
  <p>If countries want to build healthy relationships with each other, they must allow independent journalists to report the facts without hindrance. Press freedom is the cornerstone of a democratic society, and it should not be compromised in the pursuit of geopolitical power plays.</p>
