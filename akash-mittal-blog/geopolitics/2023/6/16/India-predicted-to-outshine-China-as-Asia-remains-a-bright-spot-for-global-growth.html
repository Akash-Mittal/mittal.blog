     <p>India is poised to outshine China as the leading economy in Asia. While China has been the world's fastest-growing major economy for years, its economic growth has been slowing down in recent years. On the other hand, India is experiencing a rapid economic growth with a young and dynamic workforce, improving infrastructure, and a government that is committed to economic reform.</p>
     <p>India's economic growth has not gone unnoticed by investors and businesses. Many companies are investing in India or expanding their operations there. Let's take a look at some case studies to see why.</p>

Since then, Facebook has invested heavily in India, including launching a program to provide free internet access to rural areas.
