  <p>Journalism as we know it is only possible because journalists are given the freedom to write and report on the events around them. This foundation of journalism is under threat in China, which has been clamping down on foreign journalists in recent years, and the latest victim of this is Indian journalists.</p>
  
  <p>When China issued a warning to India on August 14, 2020, it was not about border clashes or military drills, but about visas for journalists. China has refused to renew visas for Indian journalists working in China, which has left the last Indian journalist in China to leave soon. The move has been condemned by many, including the Indian government, which has described it as an attempt to control the narrative about China.</p>
  <h2>Examples with Case Studies</h2>
  <p>The Indian journalist, who is expected to leave China soon, is just one of many foreign journalists who have been targeted by the Chinese government in recent years. Since 2013, China has refused to renew the visas of more than two dozen foreign reporters, including those from The New York Times, The Guardian, and Bloomberg.</p>
  <p>The clampdown on foreign journalists in China has been getting more severe in recent years. In 2020 alone, at least ten foreign journalists were expelled from China. In June, for example, the Chinese government expelled three Wall Street Journal reporters for an opinion piece that was critical of China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
  <p>The Chinese authorities have also been making it more difficult for foreign journalists to operate in the country. For example, in 2019, the Chinese government introduced new rules that required foreign journalists to register with the government and to work only for government-approved media outlets.</p>
