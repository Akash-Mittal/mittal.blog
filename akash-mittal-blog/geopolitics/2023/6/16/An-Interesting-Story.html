They were being outplayed by top teams like Australia, South Africa, and England. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) knew they needed a change, and they appointed former Indian cricketer, Rahul Dravid as the head coach for the senior national cricket team. Dravid was hailed by many as one of the best coaches, but his credibility was put into question by Ex-Pakistan cricketer, Basit Ali. Ali claimed that Dravid is "absolutely zero" as a coach. 
  <h2>Examples</h2> Ali's statement about Dravid raises some interesting questions about his coaching abilities. However, is this really true? Let's take a look at some examples of Dravid's coaching prowess since he took over the head coach role in 2021. Under Dravid, India won the 2022 ICC U-19 Cricket World Cup. The U-19 team registered a 122-run victory over defending champions Bangladesh in the final, and the team was praised for their disciplined and aggressive performances throughout the tournament. This victory brought the Indian cricket team into the spotlight for their incredible performance. Another notable achievement during Dravid's tenure as head coach was India's historic Test series win against Australia. The Indian team defeated Australia on their home turf, which is considered a difficult task. The team had many injuries, but Dravid motivated the players and made sure they gave their best. 
  <h2>Case Studies</h2> Let us consider a few case studies that highlight Dravid's achievements as a coach: 1. Cheteshwar Pujara: Dravid is known for his reputation as a technically proficient batsman. So when he worked with Cheteshwar Pujara, Indian batsman, there was a noticeable change in Pujara's performance. Dravid worked on Pujara's technique and was instrumental in his change from a slow batsman to one who could score runs at a fast pace. 2. Prithvi Shaw: Prithvi Shaw is an Indian opener who struggled with his technique during the 2020 Indian Premier League (IPL). However, under Dravid's guidance, Shaw corrected his technical flaws and made a strong comeback in the 2021 IPL edition. 
  <h2>Conclusion</h2> In conclusion, while Basit Ali has thrown some serious accusations at Rahul Dravid as a coach, the evidence does not support his claims. Dravid is an experienced and accomplished cricketer who has scored over 24,000 international runs across formats and has served as the coach for India A and U19 squads. Furthermore, Dravid has led the coaching staff to victories in the U19 World Cup and has played a part in India's historic Test series win against Australia. To sum up, here are three key takeaways from this discussion: 1. Rahul Dravid has a proven track record as a coach and has delivered some notable achievements during his tenure as the Indian cricket team's head coach. 2. The results of Dravid's efforts can be seen in the improved performances of players such as Cheteshwar Pujara and Prithvi Shaw. 3. Ali's statement regarding Dravid's coaching abilities lacks evidence and runs contrary to the evidence of Dravid's past performances as India's head coach.
