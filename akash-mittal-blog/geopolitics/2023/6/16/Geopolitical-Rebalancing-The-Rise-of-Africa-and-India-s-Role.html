     <p>Once upon a time, India and Africa were known for their poverty, underdevelopment and domination by foreign powers. However, in the 21st century, the two regions are emerging as economic powerhouses, with rising incomes, growing middle class and expansive markets. What changed? How did Africa and India overcome their historical challenges and transform themselves? The answer lies in geopolitical rebalancing, as S Jaishankar, India's External Affairs Minister, has argued.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h2>Examples of Geopolitical Rebalancing</h2>
     <p>Geopolitical rebalancing refers to the shift in power and influence from the West to the East, as Asia, Africa and Latin America become more prominent in global affairs. This rebalancing is driven by several factors, such as:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>The rise of China and India as economic superpowers, with China surpassing the US in GDP and India becoming the fastest growing major economy in the world.</li>
      <li>The decline of the US and Europe as economic and political leaders, due to their internal problems, such as debt, inequality, populism, and their external challenges, such as terrorism, migration, climate change.</li>
      <li>The emergence of new regional powers, such as Brazil, Russia, Turkey, Iran, and South Africa, who seek to assert their influence and pursue their interests in global affairs.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>These trends have created opportunities and challenges for countries like India and Africa, which seek to leverage their strengths and overcome their weaknesses. For instance, India has pursued a policy of "Act East" to deepen its economic and strategic ties with Southeast Asia, Japan, Australia, and the Pacific, as a counterweight to China's growing influence in the region. India has also played a key role in promoting democracy, human rights, peacekeeping, and sustainable development in Africa, through its trade, investment, aid, and cultural diplomacy.</p>

     <h2>Case Studies of India's Role in Africa's Rise</h2>
     <p>India and Africa share a common history of colonial oppression, racial discrimination, and poverty. However, in the past two decades, their relations have improved significantly, as India has recognized the potential of Africa's resources, market, and talent, and Africa has welcomed India's support for its development, unity, and dignity. Here are some examples of India's role in Africa's rise:</p>
     <h3>Trade and Investment:</h3>
     <p>India is one of the largest investors and trading partners of Africa, with a total trade volume of $63 billion in 2017. India's investments in Africa cover a wide range of sectors, such as energy, agriculture, infrastructure, healthcare, education, mining, and technology. India has also provided lines of credit and grants to African countries for their socio-economic development, such as the $10 billion credit line announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2015.</p>
     <h3>Education and Training:</h3>
     <p>India has been sharing its expertise and experience in various fields with Africa, such as IT, entrepreneurship, healthcare, renewable energy, and space technology. India has set up several training and capacity-building programs for African professionals, such as the Pan-African e-Network project, which provides tele-education and tele-medicine services to 48 African countries. India has also established chairs of Indian Studies in various African universities, and scholarships for African students to study in India.</p>
     <h3>Diplomacy and Culture:</h3>
     <p>India has been actively involved in African affairs, through its participation in multilateral forums, such as the UN, G20, BRICS, and the India-Africa Forum Summit. India has supported the peace and security of Africa, by providing peacekeeping troops, humanitarian aid, and disaster relief. India has also promoted its soft power in Africa, by organizing festivals, exhibitions, and cultural exchanges, to showcase its art, music, dance, literature, and cuisine.</p>

     <h2>Conclusion: The Three Points of Geopolitical Rebalancing</h2>
     <p>In summary, India's External Affairs Minister, S Jaishankar, is right in saying that the rise of Africa is key to geopolitical rebalancing. This is because:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>Africa has the potential to become a major economic and political force in the world, due to its resources, market, and demography. India can benefit from Africa's growth by investing in its infrastructure, industries, and services, and by exporting its goods and services to its markets.</li>
      <li>Africa and India share common interests and values, such as democracy, multipolarity, non-alignment, South-South cooperation, and sustainable development. India can partner with Africa to promote these interests and values in global affairs, and to counter the hegemony and unilateralism of the West.</li>
      <li>Africa and India face common challenges and threats, such as poverty, inequality, terrorism, climate change, and disease. India can work with Africa to find solutions to these challenges and threats, through joint research, innovation, capacity-building, and cooperation, and to enhance their resilience and sustainability.</li>
