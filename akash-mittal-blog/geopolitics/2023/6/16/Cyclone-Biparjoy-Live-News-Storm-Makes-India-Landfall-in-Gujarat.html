   <p>It was a dark and stormy night when Cyclone Biparjoy made landfall in Gujarat, India, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. The sudden onset of the storm took the local population by surprise, causing widespread panic and chaos.</p>
   <h2>Examples</h2>
   <p>The impact of the storm was felt across the entire region, with many communities left without power, water, or access to medical care. The high winds and heavy rain caused extensive damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings.</p>
   <p>Local businesses were also severely affected, with many forced to shut down for days or even weeks after the storm. The cost of repairing the damage is estimated to be in the millions of dollars, with many families struggling to make ends meet in the aftermath of the disaster.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <p>One example of the impact of Cyclone Biparjoy can be seen in the village of Shiyal Bet, where a fisherman named Raju lost his entire livelihood when his boat was destroyed by the storm. Without a way to make a living, Raju is now struggling to support his family and provide for their basic needs.</p>
   <p>Another case study is the town of Una, where the local hospital was severely damaged by the storm. Doctors and nurses were forced to evacuate the building, leaving many patients without medical care. The situation was made worse by the fact that the town was already struggling with a shortage of medical supplies and staff before the storm hit.</p>
