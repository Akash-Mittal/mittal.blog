  <p>Once upon a time, a smartphone manufacturing company from China had immense control over the Indian market, capturing more than 60% of the country's smartphone sales in 2019. However, in the aftermath of the border tensions between India and China and the Indian government's ban on several Chinese apps, Chinese companies are now facing an increasingly hostile environment in India. Recently, the Indian government has advised leading Chinese smartphone makers to appoint Indian executives and equity partners in a bid to boost their businesses in India.</p>
  <h2>Chinese Smartphone Makers Directed to Appoint Indian Executives and Equity Partners</h2>
  <p>In a meeting held by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), top Chinese smartphone makers, including Xiaomi, Oppo, Realme, and Vivo, were asked to appoint Indian executives and equity partners and to expand their manufacturing capacities by investing in the country, thereby creating more domestic job opportunities. The government's advice comes as a part of its plan to encourage Indian businesses and reduce China's dominance in the Indian market.</p>
  <p>The government's directive allows the Chinese companies to own up to 74% of their business in India while the remaining 26% needs to be held by Indian equity partners. Moreover, the government has stipulated that the Indian executives appointed by these companies must hold key management positions, especially those related to legal and financial domains. According to reports, compliance with these guidelines would not only help Chinese smartphone makers build and extend their businesses in India but also enable them to avoid any future policy risks or regulatory turmoil they may face otherwise.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies of Chinese Smartphone Companies Appointing Indian Executives and Equity Partners</h2>
  <h3>Xiaomi</h3>
  <p>Xiaomi, the Chinese multinational electronics company, has been one of the most successful Chinese smartphone makers in the Indian market. At present, the company owns 4 manufacturing facilities in India, creating employment opportunities for over 20,000 people, including 50% women. The company has appointed several high-profile Indian executives, including Manu Jain as Vice President and Managing Director of Xiaomi India. Xiaomi has also partnered with Indian companies, including Dixon Technologies, BYD Electronics, and DBG Technology, to manufacture and supply their products locally.</p>
  <h3>Oppo</h3>
  <p>Another Chinese electronics brand, Oppo, has also made significant investments in India. In 2016, the company set up its own manufacturing unit in Noida, a suburb of Delhi, and has been actively hiring Indian executives to run its local business operations. According to reports, Oppo has partnered with Indian electronic devices manufacturer, Smartron, to develop its smartphones. The company has also signed several Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with different state governments in India to help build and promote startups in the country.</p>
  <h2>Impact of the Government's Directive on Chinese Smartphone Makers</h2>
  <p>The government's advisory act is a welcome step for Indian manufacturers and a blow to the Chinese companies who were once dominating the Indian market. By mandating the appointment of Indian executives and equity partners, the Indian government seeks to create an ecosystem that focuses on domestic capability development, local resource mobilization, and future contingencies. At the same time, Chinese smartphone companies are incentivized to explore possibilities of expanding their businesses amidst an environment of growing hostility towards their native country. This can be a win-win situation for both India and Chinese companies, promoting greater economic cooperation and technological advancement.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The Indian government's decision to ask Chinese smartphone manufacturers to appoint Indian executives and acquire Indian partners is a telling indication of the current state of affairs between the two countries. Nevertheless, it is a positive move towards curbing China's dominance in the Indian market while promoting domestic capability building. The directive incentivizes Chinese companies to explore untapped potential opportunities in India and invest in the country, thereby fulfilling both domestic and international obligations. If executed properly, the move will not only enhance the manufacturing output of both India and the China but also increase employment opportunities for the Indian workforce.</p><!-- References -->
