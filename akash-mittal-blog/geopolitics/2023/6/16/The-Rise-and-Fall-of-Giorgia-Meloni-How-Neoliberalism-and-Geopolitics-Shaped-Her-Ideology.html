  <p>Once, she was hailed as Italy's rising star - a charismatic, unapologetic right-wing leader who promised to put Italy first and drive out immigrants. But in recent years, Giorgia Meloni's popularity has waned, and her party, Fratelli d'Italia, has struggled to gain traction.</p>
  <p>The question is: What went wrong? The answer lies in a complex web of factors - from neoliberalism to geopolitics - that have shaped Meloni's ideology and contributed to her downfall.</p>
  <h2>Neoliberalism and the Taming of Giorgia Meloni</h2>
  <p>Neoliberalism is an economic philosophy that prioritizes free markets and individualism over government intervention and collective action. It has been a major force in shaping global politics for the past few decades - and Italy is no exception.</p>
  <p>As the Italian economy has struggled in recent years, many Italians have turned to right-wing political parties like Fratelli d'Italia in the hopes of finding a solution. And Meloni, with her fiery rhetoric and promises to put Italy first, was seen as a natural leader for this movement.</p>
  <p>But Meloni's brand of right-wing populism collided head-on with the realities of neoliberal economics. As she began to gain political power, she found herself beholden to the same economic interests and elites that she had railed against on the campaign trail.</p>
  <p>For example, in 2018, Meloni's party supported a budget that included significant cuts to public services and tax breaks for the wealthy - policies that were directly in line with neoliberal orthodoxy. This move was widely criticized by Meloni's supporters, many of whom felt that she had betrayed their trust.</p>
  <h2>Geopolitics and the Limits of Italian Nationalism</h2>
  <p>Another factor that has shaped Meloni's ideology is geopolitics - specifically, Italy's place in the European Union and the global community.</p>
  <p>On the one hand, Meloni has positioned herself as a nationalist, arguing that Italy should prioritize its own interests over those of other countries or international organizations. But on the other hand, she has found herself constrained by the realities of global politics and economics, which often require cooperation and compromise.</p>
  <p>For example, in 2019, Meloni co-led a coalition of right-wing parties in the European Parliament called the "Identity and Democracy" group. This move was seen as a bid to bolster Meloni's credibility as a nationalist leader - but it also forced her to align herself with other far-right politicians whose views didn't always align with her own.</p>
  <h2>The Taming of Giorgia Meloni: Lessons Learned</h2>
  <p>So what can we learn from the rise and fall of Giorgia Meloni? Here are three key takeaways:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Neoliberalism can undermine even the most committed populist leaders. In order to gain and maintain political power, these leaders often have to make compromises that betray the interests of their supporters. As a result, movements that are built on anti-establishment rhetoric can quickly become co-opted by the very forces they were meant to oppose.</li>
   <li>Nationalism is a powerful force, but it has its limits. As Meloni discovered, it's difficult for any country to go it alone in a globalized world. Leaders who promise to prioritize national interests over the global community often find themselves forced to make concessions and seek compromise in order to achieve their goals.</li>
   <li>The line between rhetoric and reality can be thin. Meloni's downfall shows that voters can quickly turn on a politician who fails to deliver on their promises. As such, it's important for leaders to be honest about the challenges they face and to work effectively to address them.</li>
