The upcoming 2023 ODI World Cup will no doubt be no exception. However, with the draft schedule released recently, we now know that India will face off against Pakistan on October 15 in Ahmedabad. This match will definitely be one of the most anticipated games of the tournament.</p>
    <h2>India's Journey to the World Cup</h2>
    <p>India will begin their journey to the World Cup by playing against Australia in Chennai on October 8.

The Indian team will want to maintain their winning record, while the Pakistan team will want to break the jinx and win their first ever World Cup match against India. The Pakistan team has a good mix of young and experienced players, and their captain, Babar Azam, is one of the best batsmen in the world at the moment.
