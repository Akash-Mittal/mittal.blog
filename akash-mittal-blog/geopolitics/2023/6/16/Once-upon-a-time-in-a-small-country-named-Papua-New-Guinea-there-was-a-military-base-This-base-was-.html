  <p>Examples of similar agreements between countries are plentiful. One of the most famous is the 1951 ANZUS Treaty between Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. This treaty allows the US to operate military bases in both Australia and New Zealand, and for both countries to seek mutual assistance in the event of an armed attack. While this treaty has been in place for over 70 years, it has not been without controversy. Anti-nuclear sentiment in New Zealand in the 1980s resulted in that country refusing entry to US nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed ships, and ultimately led to a cooling of relations between the two countries.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another example can be found in the 1960 agreement between the US and Spain, allowing the US to maintain military bases in Rota and Mor√≥n. This agreement has also been met with resistance, with protesters objecting to both the presence of American troops in Spain and the US's use of the bases to conduct drone operations in the Middle East and Africa.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Looking at these examples, it's clear that allowing another country access to one's military bases is a complex and often controversial issue. So what can Papua New Guinea expect as a result of this agreement with the US?</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One possible case study can be drawn from the 2001 agreement between the Philippines and the US, which allowed the US to conduct military operations in the Philippines as part of its 'War on Terror'. This agreement was highly controversial, with many Filipinos worried that it could lead to a permanent US military presence in their country. Despite these concerns, the agreement was ultimately signed and allowed the US to carry out drone strikes against militant targets in the southern Philippines. It's worth noting, however, that some experts argue that the US's presence had little impact on the country's overall security situation.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>So what can we take away from these examples? Firstly, it's clear that allowing another country access to one's military bases is a complicated issue, with economic, political, and societal factors all playing a role. Secondly, while these agreements may be signed with the best intentions, they can often be met with resistance and controversy. Finally, it's important to remember that the US is not the only country seeking access to military bases in other countries. China, for example, has been expanding its presence in the South China Sea and has built military bases on artificial islands in the region.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, the US's recent gain of 'unimpeded' access to Papua New Guinea's military bases is not without precedent. History shows us that allowing another country access to one's military bases is complex and often controversial, and that even the best intentions can lead to resistance and debate. While the long-term impact of this agreement remains to be seen, it's important to keep in mind that other countries, such as China, are also looking to expand their military presence in the region.</p>
