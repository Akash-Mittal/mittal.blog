    <h2>The Story of a Fisherman</h2>
    <p>Babu, a fisherman from the coastal village of Puri in India, has been fishing in the Bay of Bengal for over 40 years. He has seen the sea change color from blue to green and then to brown. He has seen the sea become more violent and unpredictable, with waves as tall as buildings.</p>
    <p>During the 1999 cyclone, which killed over 15,000 people in Odisha, Babu was at sea. He saw his colleagues drown before his eyes. He barely escaped with his life. Since then, he has never ventured too far from the shore during cyclones.</p>
    <p>But now, with Cyclone Yaas, which is forecast to make landfall on 26 May, Babu and his family have been asked to evacuate their home and move to a shelter.</p>

    <h2>Examples of Extreme Weather Events</h2>
    <p>Babu's story is not unique. Across the world, people are experiencing the effects of climate change in their daily lives. Here are some examples:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>In Australia, the recent bushfires destroyed millions of acres of land, killed over a billion animals, and caused widespread air pollution.</li>
     <li>In the United States, the Midwest was hit by a "bomb cyclone" in March 2019, which caused floods that destroyed homes and crops.</li>
     <li>In Bangladesh, floods and cyclones are becoming more frequent and intense, causing massive displacement of people and destruction of infrastructure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Science behind Extreme Weather Events</h2>
    <p>Scientists have been studying the effects of climate change on extreme weather events. Here are some of their findings:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Cyclones are becoming more frequent and intense due to warmer sea surface temperatures, which provide more energy for the storms.</li>
     <li>Heat waves are becoming more frequent and intense due to rising temperatures caused by greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
     <li>Floods are becoming more frequent and intense due to the increase in heavy precipitation events, which are also caused by climate change.</li>
     <li>Droughts are becoming more frequent and severe due to changes in rainfall patterns caused by climate change.</li>
    </ul>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Climate change is not just an environmental issue, but a human rights issue. People like Babu are on the frontlines of climate change, facing the brunt of its effects, while having the least responsibility for causing it. It is our collective responsibility to take action to mitigate the effects of climate change and to empower those who are most vulnerable.</p>
    <ol>
     <li>We need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by transitioning to renewable energy and implementing policies that encourage energy efficiency.</li>
     <li>We need to invest in adaptation measures that help communities prepare for and respond to extreme weather events, such as early warning systems, resilient infrastructure, and social safety nets.</li>
     <li>We need to address the root causes of climate change, such as unsustainable consumption patterns, by promoting lifestyles that prioritize social and environmental well-being over material possessions and economic growth.</li>
    </ol>
