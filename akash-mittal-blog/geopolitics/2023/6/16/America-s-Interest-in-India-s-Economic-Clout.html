     <p>John was a successful businessman who owned several companies in America. One day, he heard about a new market opportunity in India, where the economy was rapidly growing and the middle class was expanding. Intrigued, he decided to explore this potential market and flew to India for a business trip. What he found there surprised him.</p>
     <p>India was a land of contrasts, with bustling cities and rural villages, high-tech industries and traditional crafts. But what impressed John the most was the resilience of the Indian people, who had endured centuries of colonization, poverty, and political instability, yet managed to rise above their challenges and emerge as a major economic power. He realized that India was not just a market, but a partner, a friend, and a potential leader in the world.</p>
