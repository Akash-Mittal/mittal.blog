    <ul>
     <li>Trade: The US is one of India's largest trading partners, with more than $100 billion in trade between the two countries.</li>
     <li>Defense: India and the US signed a defense agreement in 2018 that allows them to share military technology and information.</li>
     <li>Climate change: The two countries have worked together to combat climate change by signing the Paris climate agreement and investing in renewable energy sources.</li>

    <h2>India and China</h2>
    <p>India and China have a complex relationship that is often characterized by both cooperation and competition. India's foreign minister recognized this and shared a few case studies to illustrate the point.</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Border disputes: India and China have long-standing border disputes in the Himalayan mountains. In 2017, tensions flared up when both countries deployed soldiers to the disputed area, resulting in a standoff. Eventually, the two countries negotiated a resolution.</li>
     <li>Trade: China is India's biggest trading partner, but the two countries have had their fair share of trade disputes. In 2020, India banned several Chinese apps citing national security concerns, which led to a drop in trade.</li>
     <li>Pandemic response: Despite their differences, India and China have worked together to combat the COVID-19 pandemic by sharing medical supplies and expertise.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The foreign minister emphasized the importance of resolving conflicts peacefully and finding ways to cooperate in areas of mutual interest.</p>
