   <p class="lead">Once upon a time, there was an election campaign in a European country. It was a tense and polarized race, with many candidates vying for the support of the voters. As the polling day approached, strange things started to happen on social media. There were fake news stories that gained traction, memes that went viral, and bots that flooded the comment sections. Some of these messages were aimed at discrediting certain candidates or parties, while others were boosting their opponents. Nobody knew who was behind all this, but some experts suspected a foreign interference campaign.</p>
   <p>Nowadays, this is not a fictional scenario, but a real threat that European democracy is facing. As the EU prepares for the next parliamentary elections in May 2019, cybersecurity experts, analysts, and policymakers are warning of the dangers of foreign meddling, particularly from China.</p>
   <h2 class="section-title">How China Could Target EU Elections</h2>
   <p>China has been increasingly assertive on the global stage in recent years, both economically and politically. As the second-largest economy in the world, China has been expanding its influence in Europe through investments, partnerships, and trade deals. It has also launched a charm offensive to improve its image and promote its culture, language, and values.</p>
   <p>However, this soft power strategy has been accompanied by more coercive and controversial tactics, such as cyber attacks, espionage, and propaganda. China has been accused of stealing intellectual property, spying on foreign governments, dissidents, and businesses, and manipulating public opinion on social media.</p>
   <p>According to a report by the European Commission's External Action Service (EEAS), China has been conducting disinformation campaigns in the EU, covering a wide range of topics, from the Belt and Road Initiative to human rights, climate change, and the economy. The aim of these campaigns is to promote China's interests and policies, undermine the EU's image and credibility, and create social divisions and confusion.</p>
   <p>China has also been accused of targeting specific countries and regions in the EU, based on their economic or political importance to China, or their perceived vulnerability to Chinese influence. For example, Greece, which has received massive Chinese investments and support, has been praised and promoted in Chinese media, while its debt crisis and refugee challenges have been downplayed. Similarly, the Visegrad Group, which consists of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, has been courted by China as a potential ally against the EU's criticism of their democratic backsliding and human rights violations.</p>
   <p>As the EEAS report warns, China's influence operations in Europe could intensify during the upcoming elections, as they offer a prime opportunity to shape public opinion and political agendas in the EU. By using cybersecurity attacks, disinformation campaigns, social media manipulation, and other means, China could try to influence the outcome of the elections, or at least sow doubt and mistrust among the voters.</p>
   <h2 class="section-title">Case Studies and Examples</h2>
   <p>Some recent cases highlight the risks and challenges of dealing with China's influence in Europe:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>In December 2018, the Czech Republic's cybersecurity agency warned that Chinese hackers had attacked the foreign ministry, the defense ministry, and other institutions, using advanced malware that had "most probably come from one of the APT (advanced persistent threat) groups linked to China."</li>
    <li>In September 2018, the French newspaper Le Figaro published an investigation that revealed how Chinese state media and diplomats had been trying to influence French politicians, academics, and journalists, by offering them trips, gifts, and flattering coverage in Chinese media. The report also mentioned that some French officials had been warned by their security services to avoid contact with Chinese agents.</li>
    <li>In April 2018, the German intelligence agency BfV (Bundesamt f√ºr Verfassungsschutz) published a report that accused China of using LinkedIn, the professional networking site, to spy on German politicians, officials, and researchers, by creating fake profiles and contacts.</li>
    <li>In March 2018, the European Parliament adopted a resolution that criticized China's "sharp power" tactics in the EU, including the manipulation of Chinese students and scholars abroad, the censorship of Chinese media and content in Europe, the harassment of ethnic and religious minorities, and the violation of intellectual property rights. The resolution urged the EU to adopt a more coordinated and comprehensive approach towards China's influence in Europe and to promote reciprocity, transparency, and fairness in the EU-China relations.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2 class="section-title">Conclusion: How to Defend EU Elections against Chinese Influence</h2>
   <p>As the EU prepares for the 2019 parliamentary elections, it must be aware of the risks and challenges of foreign interference, especially from China. To defend its democracy and sovereignty against cyber threats and disinformation campaigns, the EU should:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Strengthen its cybersecurity capabilities and resilience, by investing in cutting-edge technologies, training programs, and cooperation mechanisms with member states and external partners;</li>
    <li>Enhance its communication and outreach strategies, by improving its media literacy, fact-checking procedures, and transparency requirements for online platforms, search engines, and news outlets;</li>
    <li>Promote its values and interests, by engaging in constructive and critical dialogue with China, based on reciprocity, transparency, and mutual benefits, and by defending human rights, rule of law, and democracy, both inside and outside the EU.</li>
   </ol>
   <p>By taking these measures, the EU can strengthen its trust and cooperation with its citizens, partners, and stakeholders, and build a more trustworthy, resilient, and sovereign Europe.</p>
