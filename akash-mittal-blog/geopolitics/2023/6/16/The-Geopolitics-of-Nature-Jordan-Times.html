   <p>From Russia's war against Ukraine to America's rivalry with China, tectonic geopolitical shifts have shaken multilateralism in recent years. While many of the consequences, from surging food and energy prices to the rising risks of major conflict, have been discussed at length, more attention must be devoted to the implications of these shifts for efforts to address</p>
   <h2>An Interesting Story About The Geopolitics of Nature</h2>
   <p>Imagine a small island in the Pacific Ocean that relies on one source of freshwater. The island has been experiencing drought and the source of freshwater has been diminishing. The government of the island knows that they need to address this issue and has been in talks with neighboring countries for a possible solution. However, due to the political tensions between the countries, their efforts have been in vain. As a result, the island is facing a severe water crisis that has impacted their economy and the livelihoods of the people living on the island.</p>
   <h2>Examples with Case Studies</h2>
   <p>The story above is just one example of how natural resources can become a political tool that can be used to gain power, influence, and control. Here are some other examples:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The 2014 water crisis in Crimea, where Ukraine cut off water supply to Crimea after it was annexed by Russia, resulting in a severe shortage of water for the region.</li>
    <li>The ongoing dispute between Ethiopia, Egypt, and Sudan over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Nile River, which has threatened the water supply of Egypt and Sudan.</li>
    <li>The controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline, which was opposed by environmental groups due to its impact on the environment and wildlife.</li>
   </ul>
