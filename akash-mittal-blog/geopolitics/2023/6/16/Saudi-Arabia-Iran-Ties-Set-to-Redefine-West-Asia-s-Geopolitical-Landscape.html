    <h2>An Example of West Asia's Volatility</h2>
    <p>On January 3, 2020, the United States launched a drone strike in Baghdad, Iraq, killing Iranian General Qasem Soleimani. The strike was ordered by President Trump, citing Soleimani's "imminent and sinister" plans to kill Americans. This event escalated tensions between Iran and the United States, leading to a retaliatory missile strike by Iran on an American military base in Iraq. The tension between the two countries has influenced the geopolitical landscape of West Asia and brings attention to the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Iran.</p>

    <h2>The Common Areas of Interest of Saudi Arabia and Iran</h2>
    <p>Despite a long history of tension and rivalry, Saudi Arabia and Iran have been making efforts to align their interests in recent years. One common area of interest is oil, as both countries are major producers and rely heavily on the revenue generated from exports. Another area of interest is the fight against terrorism, particularly ISIS, which has affected both countries in recent years.</p>
    <p>More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has presented another opportunity for Saudi Arabia and Iran to work together. The two countries have cooperated in exchanging information and supplies to help contain the spread of the virus in the region.</p>
    <p>These efforts towards reproachment reflect a desire to avoid further escalation of tension and conflict in West Asia, and instead, work towards stability and cooperation.</p>

    <h2>Case Study: The OPEC Deal</h2>
    <p>A significant area of cooperation between Saudi Arabia and Iran has been in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). In April 2020, a historic agreement was reached between OPEC and other major oil producers, including Russia, to cut oil production and stabilize oil prices amidst a global oversupply and plummeting demand due to the pandemic.</p>
    <p>This agreement was historic not only because it involved a record 9.7 million barrels per day cut in oil production, but also because it was the first time in years that Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to work together. In the past, Saudi Arabia and Russia have been competitors in the global oil market, but the economic impact of the pandemic brought them together to make this deal possible.</p>
    <p>Additionally, Iran supported the OPEC deal, despite its own struggles with US sanctions affecting its oil exports. Iran's support was vital to the deal's success, as OPEC's goal was to cut production from all member countries, not just those that could afford to do so. This example highlights the potential for Saudi Arabia, Iran, and other regional powers to work together towards common economic interests.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion: Three Points to Consider</h2>
    <p>As Saudi Arabia-Iran reproachment continues, there are a few key points to consider when assessing its impact on West Asia's geopolitical landscape:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Reproachment between Saudi Arabia and Iran is not a given, and there will still be obstacles to overcome in their relationship. However, the efforts towards reproachment should be viewed positively, as it has the potential to reduce tensions and promote stability in the region.</li>
     <li>Common economic interests, such as oil and the fight against terrorism, will likely continue to be key areas of cooperation between Saudi Arabia and Iran. This could lead to greater regional economic integration and stability.</li>
     <li>The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a unique opportunity for cooperation, and it is important to note how important regional cooperation is in addressing global challenges.</li>
