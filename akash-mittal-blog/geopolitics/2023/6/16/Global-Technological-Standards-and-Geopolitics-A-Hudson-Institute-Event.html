    <h2>An Interesting Story to Start With</h2>
    <p>Imagine a world where you can't use your phone outside of your home country, where every time you travel you have to buy a new phone or router, where all the websites you use are only available in one language. This world could have been a reality if we didn't have global technological standards.</p>
    <h2>Examples with Case Studies</h2>
    <p>The discussion held by Hudson Institute on June 12 focused on the importance of global technological standards and their impact on current geopolitical issues. The experts pointed out how different countries have different standards for technologies like 5G, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things. Some countries want to create their own standards to gain a competitive advantage, while others want to adopt global standards to create interoperability and promote innovation.</p>
    <p>For example, China is investing heavily in developing its own 5G technology and standards, which would allow it to dominate the market and potentially gain control over critical infrastructure. Meanwhile, the United States is taking a different approach by promoting open and competitive systems that are interoperable with other countries. The European Union is trying to create its own technological independence while also cooperating with other countries on global standards for sustainability and privacy.</p>
    <p>The experts also discussed how technology companies are affected by these standards. Companies like Huawei, which is facing scrutiny over its ties to the Chinese government, are trying to gain access to global markets by adhering to global standards. On the other hand, some companies are pushing their own proprietary standards to gain a competitive advantage.</p>

    <ol>
     <li>Global technological standards are essential for interoperability and innovation. Without these standards, it would be difficult to use technologies across different countries and regions.</li>
     <li>Geopolitics plays a significant role in the creation of technological standards. Different countries have different interests and priorities, which can lead to competing standards and fragmentation.</li>
     <li>The future of global technological standards will depend on how countries and companies approach the issue. Cooperation and collaboration will be necessary to create standards that promote interoperability and innovation, while also addressing issues like privacy and security.</li>
