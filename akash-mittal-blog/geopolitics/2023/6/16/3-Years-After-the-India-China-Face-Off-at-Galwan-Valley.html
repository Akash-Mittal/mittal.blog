   <p>In June 2018, Indian and Chinese troops faced off in the Galwan Valley, located in the Ladakh region of the Himalayas. The dispute escalated when both sides engaged in a physical confrontation that resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers and an unknown number of Chinese soldiers. This was the deadliest clash between the two countries in more than 50 years.</p>
   <h2>Examples of the Impact</h2>
   <p>The Galwan Valley incident has had a significant impact on the relationship between India and China, as well as on the wider geopolitical landscape of Asia. Here are some examples:</p>

    <li><span class="bold">Economic Ties:</span> The border dispute has also affected economic ties between the two countries. India has banned Chinese apps, and there has been a call to boycott Chinese products.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Military Preparedness:</span> The incident has also led to increased military activity on both sides of the border. India has increased its military presence in the region, while China has been conducting military exercises and building infrastructure in the area.</li>
