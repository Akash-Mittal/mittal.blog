   <p>Imagine you are a journalist, and your government has asked you to cover the highly anticipated meeting between two powerful leaders of two major countries. You are excited and prepared to report from the heart of the event. However, as soon as you arrive, you realize that you are facing extreme difficulties to carry out your work.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, this is not a hypothetical scenario for the Indian journalist who was the last one to leave China after the Xi Jinping government instructed the Press Trust of India reporter to end their media presence in the country.</p>
   <h2>Background</h2>
   <p>The decision to end India's media presence in China by asking the last reporter to leave is a result of the deteriorating relations between the two neighboring countries. The two countries have been in a border dispute for many years, which has intensified since last year's deadly clash between Indian and Chinese soldiers.</p>
   <p>As a consequence, there has been an increase in political and economic tensions, and the media has not been immune to this. The Chinese government has been cracking down on foreign journalists, and in particular, those who report unfavorably on China. In contrast, the Indian government has recently tightened its rules on Chinese investments and Chinese apps, such as TikTok, which was banned last year.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <p>The situation for foreign journalists in China has been difficult for several years. In 2020, the Chinese government expelled over a dozen foreign reporters, including from The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post, and revoked their press credentials. Some of the most prominent cases include:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Megha Rajagopalan:</strong> In 2020, the Chinese government expelled Megha Rajagopalan, a journalist from Buzzfeed News who won the Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting for her coverage of China's mass detention of Muslims. She was denied a visa renewal, and the government gave no explanation about why she was being expelled.</li>
    <li><strong>John Sudworth:</strong> In 2021, John Sudworth, a journalist from the BBC, left China after facing increasing harassment by the Chinese authorities. He reported on topics such as Xinjiang and the COVID-19 pandemic, which did not please the Chinese government.</li>
    <li><strong>Chen Qiushi:</strong> In 2020, Chen Qiushi, a Chinese citizen journalist, disappeared when he was covering the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. His whereabouts are still unknown, and there are fears that he could have been detained or even killed by the authorities.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The situation for Indian journalists has been challenging as well. In 2015, the Chinese authorities allegedly blocked coverage of an Indian newspaper, The Hindu, which reported on China's Silk Road initiative. In 2019, an Indian journalist for The Hindu was also denied a visa to enter China to cover an event related to President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The decision to end India's media presence in China is a worrying development for press freedom in the authoritarian country. It also reflects the current state of relations between the two neighboring countries, which have been at loggerheads in recent years over issues such as border disputes and trade imbalances. India has said that it will take reciprocal action against Chinese journalists. However, it is unclear what the future holds for the media and journalists in both countries.</p>
