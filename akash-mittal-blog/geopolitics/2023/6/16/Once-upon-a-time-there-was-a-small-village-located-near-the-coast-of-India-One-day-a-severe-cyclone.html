  <title>Once upon a time, there was a small village located near the coast of India. One day, a severe cyclone hit the village and left a catastrophic impact on the lives of the villagers. It was then that the government realized the importance of keeping the coastal region on high alert before the occurrence of a natural calamity. Fast forward to the present day, a similar scenario occurred where Indian and Pakistani coasts are currently on high alert, a day before Cyclone Biparjoy is expected to make landfall. </title>

  <p>The cyclones are natural disasters that can cause widespread destruction to the coastal regions, leaving a massive trail of damage. The Government authorities have to pre-plan well in advance to mitigate the adverse effect on the life and property of the citizens. India and Pakistan have been working religiously on monitoring the weather patterns in the region and computer models to forecast and alert people about the probable cyclones.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The importance of keeping track of the weather patterns in coastal regions has increasingly become crucial in recent years. Let's take the case of Odisha, a state in eastern India that gets hit by the cyclonic storms every year. In 2019, when Cyclone Fani hit the state, the authorities moved around 16 lakh people to safer places and set up cyclone shelters for them. Their timely action prevented massive destruction, and the loss of life and property was minimal. Similarly, during the recent cyclonic storm Nivar, the Tamil Nadu government's quick response and proactive measures helped in averting any major losses whatsoever.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The occurrence of a natural calamity is an unexpected event that can cause unimaginable havoc, but timely preparedness, trained personnel, and advanced planning can reduce the adverse impact. Countries like India, which are prone to natural calamities, need to have preordained resources, training, and expert teams to deal with these eventualities.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, here are three essential points to keep in mind while handling natural calamities in the coastal regions:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Preparation and Pre-planning: The government authorities should establish an effective communication network with the citizens, equip them with proper education and information on dealing with the natural calamities.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Availability and Accessibility of Resources: Equip the state and the community with necessary pieces of equipment like boats, life jackets, and other essential things that will become crucial during the crisis.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Proactive Measures: The government should provide adequate measures ahead of the severe weather patterns, like deploying disaster management teams and setting up makeshift cyclone shelters to minimize the loss of life and property.</p>
