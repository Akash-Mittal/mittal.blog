  <p>In May 2020, Cyclone Amphan hit Sunderbans, causing widespread damage to the habitat of tigers, leopards, and spotted deer. It was estimated that nearly 5.2 million people in India and 3.4 million in Bangladesh were affected by the cyclone.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The impact of Cyclone Amphan on the Sunderbans was not limited to the loss of flora and fauna. The cyclone also had a severe impact on the livelihoods of the local communities. Many fishermen lost their boats and nets, while farmers lost their crops. Furthermore, the storm surge caused by the cyclone inundated the land with saltwater, leading to a loss of agriculture for months to come.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Cyclones are not an unusual phenomenon in India, and the country has seen several such natural disasters in recent years. In 2019, Cyclone Fani hit the state of Odisha, causing extensive damage to properties and infrastructure. However, the state's preparedness and quick response in evacuating people to safer places helped to minimize the loss of life.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In the case of Cyclone Biparjoy, India and Pakistan have taken proactive measures to evacuate people from the affected areas. The authorities have also set up relief camps and deployed rescue teams to mitigate the impact of the cyclone.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, the impact of cyclones can be devastating, causing loss of life, property, and livelihoods. However, with proper preparedness and timely response, the impact of such natural disasters can be minimized.</p>
