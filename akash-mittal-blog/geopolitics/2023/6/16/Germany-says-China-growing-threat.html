  <p>Once upon a time, in a world of peaceful trade relations, Germany and China were seen as close economic partners. However, things have taken a different turn lately, with Germany viewing China as a growing threat. In October 2021, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, in her last official visit to China before retiring, warned about China's growing economic and military power, emphasizing that it should be addressed in a way that preserves democracy and human rights. This statement reflects how the once strong alliance is gradually deteriorating as countries become increasingly mindful of China's exploits, particularly with regard to economic power.</p>
  <h2>The China threat: examples and case studies</h2>
  <p>Germany's concerns about China are not unfounded. The following are some examples and case studies of how China has threatened Germany's economic and strategic interests:</p>
  <h3>The Huawei case</h3>
  <p>In 2018, the United States warned Germany against using Chinese tech giant Huawei's telecommunications equipment, citing spying concerns. However, Germany largely ignored these warnings, as it did not see China as a hostile country. However, the following year, as the European Union also started cracking down on the tech giant, Germany finally gave in and, in 2020, banned Huawei from bidding on its 5G network.</p>
  <h3>The hidden dragon in German industries</h3>
  <p>Over the past decade, Chinese investors have poured billions of euros into German industries through mergers and acquisitions. Germany often welcomed these investments as a sign of a growing friendship between the two nations. However, recently, there have been fears that these investments are part of Chinese efforts to gain control of crucial German industries. Chinese state-owned firms have been acquiring German businesses in the robotics, semiconductor, and energy sectors, among others. German politicians have expressed concern that China might use these acquisitions for strategic purposes, posing a security risk to Germany, particularly if China uses these technologies to catch up and overtake German industries.</p>
  <h3>The Xinjiang issue</h3>
  <p>China's crackdown on Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang has infuriated the global community, with many countries condemning China for human rights violations. This issue also threatens Germany's relationship with China, as Germany has a large population of Turkish Muslims who sympathize with the Uyghurs. German politicians have been calling on the EU to put pressure on China to abandon its treatment of Uyghurs, which has caused Germany to partially rely on ethical considerations while maintaining its economic relations with China.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, Germany's stance on China has significantly changed in the past few years, reflecting a gradual, global paradigm shift. Cooperation with China is no longer seen as mutually beneficial, and the Chinese government's increasing grip on domestic industries and suppression of human rights are raising significant concerns in Germany. Germany's concerns include China's goal of becoming a world superpower, with an increasingly assertive military and economic policy. Consequently, there is a need for international cooperation on challenges posed by China to the world's democracies' political and economic interests.</p>
  <h3>Three crucial points to take away from Germany's concern about China are:</h3>
  <ol>
   <li>The risks of China's increasing assertiveness cannot be overlooked and need to be addressed.</li>
   <li>International cooperation and solidarity are necessary in responding effectively to China's threats.</li>
   <li>Germany's relationship with China could serve as a model for other countries in the West wondering how to handle China's economic, political, and military power.</li>
  </ol>
