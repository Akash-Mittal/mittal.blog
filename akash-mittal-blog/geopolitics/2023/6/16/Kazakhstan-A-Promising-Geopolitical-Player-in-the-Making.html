  <h1>Kazakhstan: A Promising Geopolitical Player in the Making</h1></br> <img src="images/Kazakhstan-A-Promising-Geopolitical-Player-in-the-Making.jpeg" alt="+Kazakhstan-A-Promising-Geopolitical-Player-in-the-Making+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/central-asia/news/western-pundits-offer-advice-on-kazakh-geopolitics/" target="_blank" href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/central-asia/news/western-pundits-offer-advice-on-kazakh-geopolitics/" rel="noopener">https://www.euractiv.com/section/central-asia/news/western-pundits-offer-advice-on-kazakh-geopolitics/</a></span></h5>
  <p>Once an integral part of the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan has come a long way since its independence in 1991. With a population of nearly 19 million, the country has evolved into a regional heavyweight, with its economy and geopolitical significance steadily increasing over the years. Although it is still grappling with various challenges, such as corruption and the need for democratic reforms, Kazakhstan's future prospects appear bright.</p>
  <h2>The Rise of Kazakhstan</h2>
  <p>Kazakhstan has made significant strides in the past few decades towards becoming a more developed, diversified and modern economy. As one of the world's largest producers of natural resources such as oil, gas, coal, and copper, it has leveraged its strategic geographic location to establish itself as a crucial regional hub for transportation and logistics, connecting Europe and Asia. Major investments in infrastructure, education and innovation have contributed to the country's impressive growth, which averaged 4% annually over the last decade.</p>
  <p>Additionally, Kazakhstan has consistently sought to enhance its international standing and engagement, striving to build partnerships and cooperation with various countries and organizations. As the largest and most advanced economy in Central Asia, it has gained significant diplomatic and political clout, becoming a member of the Eurasian Economic Union, the UN, the OSCE, and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, among others.</p>
  <h2>The EU-Kazakhstan Partnership Potential</h2>
  <p>Given Kazakhstan's emergence as a key player in the region and its aspirations towards greater global engagement, it is natural that the European Union should engage it as a partner. Not only does Kazakhstan offer new markets for European companies while providing access to Chinese and Russian markets, the country also shares common values and interests with the EU in fields such as energy, climate change, and security.</p>
  <p>The EU is Kazakhstan's largest trade partner, with total bilateral trade reaching â‚¬21.5 billion in 2020. Despite this, the full potential of the partnership is yet to be realized, and both sides would benefit from closer cooperation. As Kazakhstan's Foreign Minister Erlan Idrissov stated during a visit to Brussels in 2015, "Kazakhstan is Europe's gateway to Central Asia and the EU is Kazakhstan's window to the West."</p>
  <p>There is a growing consensus among Western experts and analysts that Kazakhstan's potential as a partner is indeed significant. Several former diplomats have expressed their positive assessment of Kazakhstan's capabilities, emphasizing its strategic location, economic potential, and stability as attractive factors for EU engagement.</p>
  <h2>Avoiding the China Overtake</h2>
  <p>One of the challenges for both the EU and Kazakhstan is the rising competition and influence of China in the region. With its Belt and Road Initiative, China has invested heavily in infrastructure projects in Kazakhstan and other Central Asian countries, and is becoming an increasingly important trade and economic partner for the region. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, Western experts warn against complacency and advise the EU to stay engaged and active in the region.</p>
  <p>One example of Chinese investment in Kazakhstan is the Khorgos Gateway, a major logistics hub on the border between Kazakhstan and China that aims to boost trade and connectivity between the two countries. However, EU companies are also getting involved in the project, with Maersk and DB Schenker partnering to provide logistics services, highlighting the potential of collaboration between both sides.</p>
  <p>It is clear that the EU and Kazakhstan share common interests and values in areas such as trade, security, and energy. While China's presence in the region is growing, the EU should not see this as a threat but rather an opportunity for more cooperation. By working together, the EU and Kazakhstan can help shape the future of Central Asia and foster greater stability and prosperity in the region.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Kazakhstan's evolution from a Soviet republic to a modern and developed state is impressive, and its potential as a key player in Central Asia and a partner for the EU is significant. The EU should not miss this opportunity to deepen its relationship with Kazakhstan, a country that shares similar values and ambitions. While challenges remain, especially in areas such as political reforms and corruption, Kazakhstan is on the right path towards a more prosperous and democratic future. With more cooperation and engagement, the EU and Kazakhstan can help unlock each other's potential and contribute to a more stable and prosperous world.</p>
