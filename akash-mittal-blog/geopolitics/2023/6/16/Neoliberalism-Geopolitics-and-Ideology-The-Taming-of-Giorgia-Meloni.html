  <p>In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards neoliberalism and geopolitics in shaping the world order. This has led to the rise of populist politicians like Giorgia Meloni, who have used their nationalistic ideologies to appeal to the masses. However, as this article will show, even the most fiery and uncompromising politicians can be tamed by the forces of neoliberalism and geopolitics.</p>
  
  <p>Giorgia Meloni is a well-known Italian politician who heads the Brothers of Italy party. She first came to prominence as a member of the right-wing National Alliance party in the early 2000s, before breaking away to form her own party in 2012.</p>
  <p>At the time, Meloni was seen as a fierce and uncompromising politician who was unafraid to speak her mind and challenge the political establishment. She was a vocal opponent of immigration, multiculturalism, and Islam, and her nationalist ideology resonated with many Italians who were disillusioned with mainstream politics.</p>
  <p>However, as Meloni's political career has progressed, it has become clear that she has been increasingly tamed by the forces of neoliberalism and geopolitics. This can be seen in a number of ways, as we will now explore.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <h3>1. Immigrants</h3>
  <p>One of the core tenets of Meloni's nationalist ideology is her opposition to immigration. However, as Italy has become more and more integrated into the global economy, it has become clear that the country relies heavily on immigrant labor.</p>
  <p>As a result, Meloni has been forced to temper her views and adopt a more pragmatic approach. In recent years, she has focused less on opposing immigration outright and more on ensuring that those who do come to Italy are properly integrated and contribute to the economy.</p>
  <h3>2. Europe</h3>
  <p>Another key issue for Meloni and her party is their opposition to the European Union. However, as Italy's economy has struggled in recent years, it has become clear that the country needs the support and investment of the EU in order to survive.</p>
  <p>As a result, Meloni has been forced to moderate her views on Europe. While she is still critical of the EU's policies and structures, she has become more open to working with European countries and institutions to secure the best possible deal for Italy.</p>
  <h3>3. Russia</h3>
  <p>Finally, Meloni's nationalist ideology is rooted in her opposition to Russia. However, as the geopolitical landscape has shifted in recent years, it has become clear that Italy needs to maintain good relations with Moscow in order to advance its own interests.</p>
  <p>As a result, Meloni has been forced to soften her views on Russia. While she is still critical of some of the Kremlin's policies, she has become more open to working with Russia to advance Italy's own geopolitical agenda.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, it is clear that even the most fiery and uncompromising politicians can be tamed by the forces of neoliberalism and geopolitics. Giorgia Meloni's case is just one example of this phenomenon, which is becoming increasingly common in today's globalized world.</p>
  <p>As nationalistic ideologies continue to clash with the realities of the global economy and geopolitical landscape, we can expect to see more and more politicians forced to moderate their views and adopt a more pragmatic approach.</p>
