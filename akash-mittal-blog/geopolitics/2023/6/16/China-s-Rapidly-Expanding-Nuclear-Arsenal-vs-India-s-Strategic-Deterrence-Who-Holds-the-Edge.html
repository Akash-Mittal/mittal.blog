  <p>Once upon a time, two neighbors lived in a small village. They were constantly quarreling with each other over petty issues. One day, one of them brought a huge stick and started threatening the other. The second person did not have any weapon to defend himself. However, he remained calm and confident. He was sure that his presence of mind and inner strength will help him tackle the situation. And it did. The first person eventually gave up and left.</p>
  <p>Similarly, in the current scenario, China is rapidly expanding its nuclear weapons arsenal, while India remains confident of its strategic deterrence. Let us delve deeper into the subject with some examples.</p>
  <h2>China's Nuclear Weapons Arsenal</h2>
  <p>China is a nuclear-armed state and has the world's second-largest nuclear arsenal. It has an estimated stockpile of around 350 nuclear weapons. Recently, China has increased its focus on developing a sea-based nuclear deterrent, including its first nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine.</p>
  <p>However, China's aggressive stance on the border dispute with India, Taiwan, and other countries in the region has led to concerns about its nuclear intentions. The Chinese government has hinted at the use of nuclear weapons in a limited war scenario, which has raised alarms in the international community.</p>
  <h2>India's Strategic Deterrence</h2>
  <p>India follows a "no first use" policy when it comes to nuclear weapons. It maintains a credible minimum deterrence posture, which means that it has to have enough nuclear weapons to deter an adversary from launching a nuclear attack but not to initiate one.</p>
  <p>India's strategic deterrence is based on a triad of land-based, sea-based, and air-based delivery systems. In recent years, India has increased its focus on developing a robust ballistic missile defense system, which has further strengthened its strategic deterrence.</p>
  <h2>Case Study: The Doklam Standoff</h2>
  <p>The Doklam standoff between India and China in 2017 highlighted the importance of strategic deterrence. In June 2017, Chinese troops started building a road in Doklam, a disputed territory between China and Bhutan. India intervened to stop the construction, and it resulted in a tense stand-off between the two countries.</p>
  <p>During the crisis, India deployed its troops, tanks, and artillery guns to the region, which sent a clear message to China that India was ready to defend its territory. India's strategic deterrence played a crucial role in resolving the standoff without any military conflict.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The growing nuclear arsenal of China is a cause of concern for the global community. However, India's strategic deterrence capabilities have increased in recent years, which has ensured that the country remains confident in dealing with any possible threats. India's focus on a credible minimum deterrence posture, a robust ballistic missile defense system, and a triad of land, sea, and air-based delivery systems has given it an edge over its adversaries.</p>
