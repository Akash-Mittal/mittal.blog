    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>On September 22, 2020, a 5.8 magnitude earthquake hit the northeastern region of Pakistan, affecting various parts of India and Pakistan. While natural disasters garner serious attention, social media users have found creative ways to cope with the situation through humor and memes. This article aims to explore the different memetic reactions that flooded various social media platforms in the aftermath of the earthquake.</p>

   <div id="examples">
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>One popular meme that circulated on Twitter and Facebook was an image of a football player falling to the ground, with the caption "How I survived the earthquake." This image was shared numerous times and shows how people use humor as a coping mechanism during times of stress. Another example of memetic reaction is the use of popular Bollywood movie clips and songs to depict the earthquake. A scene from the Bollywood movie Lagaan was used to show how the earthquake affected cricket matches. The song "Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham" was also remixed to relate to the earthquake, with the new version titled "Kabhi Earthquake Kabhi Aftershock."</p>
