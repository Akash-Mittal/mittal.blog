  <title>Once upon a time in Italy, there was a young politician named Giorgia Meloni who stood for everything that was right-wing: anti-immigration, anti-feminist, and euro-skeptic. She was a fierce opponent of the European Union and believed that Italy should regain its sovereignty back. She rose to fame in 2008, when she founded a new political party called the Brothers of Italy (FdI) to unite right-wing factions that were unhappy with Silvio Berlusconi's political positions. Her party began to gain momentum, so much so that she was considered a potential prime ministerial candidate in the 2018 Italian elections. However, she soon found herself the victim of a political taming carried out by the neoliberal establishment, the forces of geopolitical hegemony, and the global media universe.</title>

  <p>Neoliberalism is an economic ideology that promotes free-market capitalism and individualism. It is the ideology of globalization, privatization, and liberalization. Neoliberalism has its roots in the 1930s, but it was not until the 1970s that it gained traction and became the dominant economic system in the world. Neoliberalism is popular with business elites and governments, but it can create a lot of problems for ordinary people. Giorgia Meloni's anti-immigration, anti-feminist, euro-skeptic stance did not fit well with the neoliberal establishment, which relies heavily on immigration, identity politics, and the EU. It became clear that Meloni needed to be tamed before she could be accepted by the establishment.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Geopolitics is the study of the relationships between political power, geography, and economics. It is the field that studies the strategic importance of regions, countries, and territories. Geopolitics is closely linked to imperialism and hegemony, as it deals with the exercise of power and influence over other nations. The neoliberal establishment uses geopolitics to maintain its hegemony over the world. Italy is a strategic region, and it is in the interest of the neoliberal establishment to control Italian politics. The establishment uses various tactics to tame politicians who try to challenge its hegemony, such as funding, media manipulation, and surveillance.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Giorgia Meloni was tamed using a combination of neoliberalism and geopolitics. The establishment co-opted her by offering her a place in the government in exchange for toning down her political positions. Meloni accepted the offer and became a member of the Italian parliament. However, she soon realized that she was not as powerful as she thought she would be. She became a pawn in the game of geopolitics, as Italy was being squeezed by various global powers for their own interests. Meloni's anti-immigrant and euro-skeptic rhetoric was toned down, and she began to support the EU and its policies.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case study 1: The global media universe played a significant role in taming Meloni. The media is a powerful tool in the hands of the establishment, as it can shape public opinion and frame political discourse. The media portrayed Meloni as a far-right extremist who was not fit to lead Italy. Meloni's anti-immigrant and euro-skeptic rhetoric was widely criticized in the media, and her party was labeled as a neo-fascist group. The media played a significant role in shaping public opinion and taming Meloni.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case study 2: The neoliberal establishment also used its financial power to tame Meloni. Meloni's political party was dependent on funding from the establishment, and the establishment used this to control her. Funding was used as leverage to influence Meloni's political positions. The establishment threatened to cut funding if Meloni did not tone down her anti-immigrant and euro-skeptic rhetoric.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case study 3: The global geopolitical situation also played a role in taming Meloni. Italy is a strategic region with significant geopolitical importance. Various global powers, such as the US, Russia, and China, have an interest in controlling Italy's politics. These global powers use various tactics to influence Italian politics, such as funding, media manipulation, and surveillance. Italy's strategic importance means that any politician who challenges the status quo will be tamed or removed from office.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, Giorgia Meloni is an example of how the neoliberal establishment uses its power to tame politicians who challenge its hegemony. Meloni's anti-immigrant and euro-skeptic rhetoric did not fit well with the establishment's agenda, so she was co-opted and tamed. The establishment used a combination of neoliberalism and geopolitics to control Meloni. The case studies show how the establishment used the media, funding, and global geopolitical interests to shape Meloni's political positions. In the end, Meloni became a pawn in the game of geopolitics, serving the interests of the establishment rather than her own. The lesson here is that any politician who challenges the status quo will be tamed or removed from office unless they can find a way to resist the establishment's power.</p>
