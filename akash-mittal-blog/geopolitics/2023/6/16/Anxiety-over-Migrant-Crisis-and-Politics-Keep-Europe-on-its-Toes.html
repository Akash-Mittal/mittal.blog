  <p>Europe seems to be on the verge of a political breakdown, but it is not only due to the ongoing migrant crisis – political rifts between EU member states also loom large. Let's take a closer look at two key issues causing uncertainty in the region today.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The Migrant Crisis: An Impetus for Change</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The refugee crisis in Europe has prompted discussions on the need for a common asylum policy. This crisis has been, however, creating rifts between European Union countries since the Syrian refugee crisis began in 2015. Many countries expressed concern over their perceived inability to protect their borders from illegal immigrants, leading some to abandon their promise to provide refuge to those in need.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Under such circumstances, things become even more complex when geopolitical tensions comes in the way, such as the spat between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Russia-Ukraine Tensions sees Brussels Looking for a Migrant Deal</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The biggest geopolitical problem of Europe comes from the Russia-Ukraine crisis, which has adversely affected the entire continent. Moscow is firmly pointing the finger at Kyiv as the primary source of the problem, insisting that its military aggression in eastern Ukraine is the root cause of the conflict. While the situation has improved in many ways, both sides remain wary of each other.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The Brussels administration believes that if the Ukraine crisis continues to escalate, there will be a need for a new treaty with Russia on the refugee issue. Most experts believe that the only way to find a sustainable solution to the refugee crisis is to step up the sharing of the burden across EU member states.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In this context, Hungary stands out for its hardline policies towards refugees. Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, has been criticized both internally and internationally for his stance on the issue, which includes building a wall to prevent migrants from getting into the country. He has argued that the current system unfairly burdens countries such as Hungary, which are unwilling to accept refugees.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion,</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. The migrant crisis in Europe is sometimes viewed as the primary driver of political instability in the region, but the situation is more complex than that. The ongoing political rift between EU member states and the Russia-Ukraine crisis both add to the uncertainty.</p>
  <p>2. EU member states need to work together for a common asylum policy, instead of acting only for their own political interests. This is the only way to ensure that refugees are provided safe passage and a new home, and share the burden among member countries.</p>
  <p>3. The Russia-Ukraine political standoff must be resolved without delay and this would give a real chance to the EU to solve the refugee problem and to achieve political and economic stability.</p>
