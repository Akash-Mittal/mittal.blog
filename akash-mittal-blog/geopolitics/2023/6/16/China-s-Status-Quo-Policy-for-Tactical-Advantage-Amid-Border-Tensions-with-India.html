  <p>On a bright sunny morning in July 2020, the peaceful Galwan Valley in Ladakh, India, witnessed a violent clash between Indian and Chinese troops. The clash led to the death of 20 Indian soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese casualties. This was not the first time that tensions had escalated along the India-China border, but it was certainly the deadliest in decades.</p>
  <p>Since the 1962 war between the two nations, the Line of Actual Control (LAC) has been the de-facto border between India and China. However, the actual delineation of the LAC is not agreed upon by both nations, leading to perennial border disputes. But what is China's strategy for maintaining its dominance amid such tensions?</p>
  <h2>The Status Quo Policy</h2>
  <p>China follows a "status quo" policy when it comes to border disputes. It simply means that China uses its military and economic might to maintain the current situation along the border. It does not want to make any move that could lead to an armed conflict, but it also wants to assert its territorial claims. This policy is primarily based on three factors:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Strategic Advantage</li>
   <li>Diplomacy</li>
   <li>Domestic Pressure</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Strategic Advantage</h3>
  <p>China's military is the largest in the world, and it has invested heavily in building infrastructure along the China-India border. It has built roads and railroads to support its troops and weapons, and it has set up military bases in the area. This enables China to respond quickly to any situation and gain an advantage over India. China believes that the current status quo is in its interest, and it will continue to maintain it as long as India does not take any steps to alter it.</p>
  <h3>Diplomacy</h3>
  <p>China is also using diplomacy to maintain the status quo. It engages in talks with India at various levels to defuse tensions and prevent any escalation. However, China's diplomacy is not just limited to India. It engages with other countries in the region to expand its influence and diplomatic power. China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a massive infrastructure project that aims to connect China with Asia, Europe, and Africa. It is an attempt by China to expand its economic and political clout in the region and beyond.</p>
  <h3>Domestic Pressure</h3>
  <p>The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) faces domestic pressure to assert China's power and dominance. Any perceived weakness or compromise with India could harm the CCP's image and undermine its legitimacy. The CCP uses propaganda and censorship to control the narrative, and it portrays India as a hostile neighbor that wants to weaken and encircle China. This creates a domestic audience for the CCP's policies and makes it difficult for the Chinese government to compromise on any issue related to India.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <h3>Doklam Standoff (2017)</h3>
  <p>In 2017, India and China had a standoff in the Doklam plateau, which is at the tri-junction of India, China, and Bhutan. China wanted to extend a road near the plateau, but India objected, saying it violated Bhutan's sovereignty. The standoff lasted for 73 days, and the two nations finally agreed to disengage. However, China did not withdraw its troops from the region and extended its infrastructure in the area. This demonstrates China's use of its economic and military power to maintain the status quo.</p>
  <h3>Galwan Valley Clash (2020)</h3>
  <p>The recent clash in the Galwan Valley is another example of China's status quo policy. China had set up temporary structures near the LAC, which India objected to. However, China did not dismantle those structures, and when India sent troops to do so, a violent clash broke out. The incident shows that China is not interested in changing the status quo but is willing to use force if necessary to maintain its dominance.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>China's status quo policy is not only about maintaining the current situation along the border, but it is also about gaining strategic advantage, using diplomacy, and managing domestic pressures. China wants to assert its territorial claims while avoiding any armed conflict with India. It is using its economic and military might to expand its influence and control the narrative. However, this policy may lead to a long-term strategic disadvantage if China does not address India's concerns and find a way to resolve the border disputes peacefully.</p>
