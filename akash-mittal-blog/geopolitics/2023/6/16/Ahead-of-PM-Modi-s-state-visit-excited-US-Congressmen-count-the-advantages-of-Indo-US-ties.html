   <p>As a child, Senator John had a pen-pal from India. He remembers the excitement of receiving letters from across the ocean, learning about a different culture and country, and sharing his own American experiences. Today, as a member of the US Congress, he sees the potential of the Indo-US ties to promote trade, investments, security, defense, energy, technology, healthcare, and education between the two nations, and he eagerly awaits the state visit of PM Modi to discuss these issues.</p>
   <h2>Trade and Investments</h2>
   <p>The Indo-US trade has grown from $16 billion in 2001 to $149 billion in 2019, making the US India's second-largest trade partner after China. The trade is diversified across various sectors such as information technology, pharmaceuticals, automobiles, machinery, and textiles, among others. The US Congress has been supportive of deepening the trade relations with India by negotiating a bilateral investment treaty, reducing trade barriers, and increasing the access of US companies to the Indian market. These measures could create more jobs in both countries and boost the global economy.</p>
   <h2>Security and Defense</h2>
   <p>The Indo-US defense ties have grown from buying a few arms in the 1950s to conducting joint military exercises, sharing intelligence, and co-developing defense technologies today. The US Congress has been a key partner in this process by approving defense deals, transferring technology, and supporting military-to-military contacts. These ties not only enhance the security of the two nations but also contribute to regional stability and global peace.</p>
   <h2>Energy and Technology</h2>
   <p>The Indo-US energy ties have grown from importing oil to exploring renewable sources, such as solar, wind, and nuclear energy, and collaborating on energy efficiency and emissions reduction. The US Congress has been instrumental in expanding these ties by investing in research and development, promoting energy trade and investment, and creating partnerships between academia, industry, and governments. These ties not only improve the energy security and sustainability of the two nations but also address climate change and foster innovation and growth.</p>
   <h2>Healthcare and Education</h2>
   <p>The Indo-US healthcare and education ties have grown from providing aid to collaborating on research, training, and capacity building. The US Congress has been supportive of this process by funding health and education programs, promoting public-private partnerships, and facilitating student and academic exchanges. These ties not only improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare and education in both countries but also create opportunities for cultural exchange and mutual learning.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <p>One of the successful Indo-US joint ventures is the Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) North America, which employs over 30,000 people and has a market value of $100 billion. TCS provides digital services and consulting to various US clients and contributes to the local economy by paying taxes, creating jobs, and investing in community development. Another example is the Indo-US Science and Technology Forum (IUSSTF), which promotes collaborative research and innovation in various fields such as cybersecurity, cancer biology, and climate science. IUSSTF offers fellowship programs, grants, and workshops to Indian and US scientists and engineers and fosters long-term partnerships between the two nations.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>The Indo-US ties have grown significantly in recent years, covering various sectors such as trade, investments, security, defense, energy, technology, healthcare, and education.</li>
    <li>The US Congress has been a key partner in strengthening these ties by passing laws, approving deals, funding programs, and engaging with Indian counterparts.</li>
    <li>The state visit of PM Modi to the US is an opportunity to further deepen the Indo-US ties and address common challenges and opportunities in the 21st century.</li>
