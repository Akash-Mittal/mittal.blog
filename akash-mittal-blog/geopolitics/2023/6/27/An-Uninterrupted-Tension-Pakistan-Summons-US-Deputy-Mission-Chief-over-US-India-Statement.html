  <p>Pakistan and the United States have been on the opposite side of the fence for quite some time now. The tension between the two puts in mind an old story of a farmer and his horse. The moral of the story is this: sometimes a problem is just as easy as taking responsibility instead of blaming others.</p>
  <p>Both nations have blamed each other for their respective failures. However, this time, it is Pakistan that has summoned the US Deputy Mission Chief over the US-India Statement, further increasing the already tensed relation.</p>
  <h2>The US-India Statement: The Bone of Contention</h2>
  <p>The US-India statement that has caused the recent uproar between Pakistan and USA read: "The US Policy toward South Asia prioritizes support for India's emergence as a leading global power and as a stronger strategic and defense partner."</p>
  <p>Pakistan's Foreign Ministry has raised its concern and summoned US Deputy Chief of Mission to Karachi John Hoover to explain. The statement was viewed as a direct tilt towards India from the US, which Pakistan considers biased.</p>
  <p>The statement also comes at a time when India and Pakistan are at odds on several matters, including the Kashmir issue, the water dispute, alleged Indian aggression at the Line of Control, and blame of cross-border terrorism.</p>
  <h2>Examples of a Mistrusted Relation</h2>
  <p>The mistrust between Pakistan and America goes back decades.</p>
  <p>On July 4th, 1979, the US Assistant Secretary of State Harold H. Saunders visited Pakistan. During his visit, he gave a stern warning to Pakistan to reconsider her growing nuclear program and ordered Pakistan's General Zia-ul-Haq to halt the program with immediate effect. General Zia, also known as an acrobat of power, said: "Pakistan cannot afford to freeze the program due to the security threats posed by India."</p>
  <p>In 1998, Pakistan conducted a nuclear test, and the United States imposed strict economic sanctions on Pakistan as a reaction to the act. It was during these times that Pakistan realized the importance of China as its consistent friend.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies of Miscommunication and Trust Deficit</h2>
  <p>The controversy over the US-India statement is but a recent example of the bilateral lack of trust.</p>
  <p>The frequent seals and unseals of Pakistan's western border due to ongoing conflicts with Afghanistan have been a significant cause of mistrust between the two countries. It is a fact that the US has helped Pakistan over the years financially and militarily to support its involvement in the Afghan war. But during peace talks between the Taliban and the US, Pakistan was excluded from the talks as the US feared that Pakistan would help the Taliban.</p>
  <p>In 2011, Osama bin Laden was found in Pakistan. It was a severe blow to the country's reputation, and the US military operation to catch bin Laden was conducted without Pakistan's knowledge. The incident led to mistrust and, in turn, resulted in a series of events that led to the present-day tensed relationship.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion in Three Points</h2>
  <p>In my opinion, the mistrust between Pakistan and the United States is a never-ending loop of blame games. It is because both countries have been quick to blame, and slow to accept their mistakes. However, the following points can help ease the tension:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Both countries need to have honest and open communication to clear up any misunderstandings. Lack of communication will only lead to mistrust and miscommunication.</li>
   <li>The US needs to stop aligning itself with one side of any conflict and, instead, aim to be a neutral mediator that works for the greater good of the region. This can help remove the biases that Pakistan sees in every US action.</li>
   <li>Pakistan must take responsibility and be accountable for their actions. Instead of pushing blame onto others, it needs to introspect and acknowledge its shortcomings.</li>
  </ul>
