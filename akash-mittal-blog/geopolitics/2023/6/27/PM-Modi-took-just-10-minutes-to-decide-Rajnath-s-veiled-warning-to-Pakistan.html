  <p>India's Home Minister, Rajnath Singh, recently made a statement indicating the decisive nature of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership. According to Singh, PM Modi "took just 10 minutes to decide" on critical security measures after the Pulwama terror attack in 2019. The underlying message in Singh's statement is one of strength and decisiveness in India's foreign policy.</p>
  <h2>Examples of India's Strong Foreign Policy</h2>
  <p>The Indian government's decisive response to the Pulwama terror attack is just one example of its strong foreign policy. In 2016, India chose to boycott the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) summit in Pakistan after a similar attack on an Indian army base in Uri. This boycott was a clear signal of India's disapproval of Pakistan's lack of action against cross-border terrorism.</p>
  <p>In addition to taking a firm stance on terrorism, India has also sought to strengthen international relations with other countries. The country has established strong ties with Japan, Australia, and the United States, forming the "Quad" alliance. This strategic partnership aims to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific region and counter China's growing influence in the region.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies of India's Approach to Regional Security</h2>
  <h3>India and Afghanistan</h3>
  <p>India has been a key partner in Afghanistan's reconstruction and development efforts. India has invested more than $3 billion in projects ranging from infrastructure development to education and healthcare. This partnership has been critical in stabilizing Afghanistan and countering the influence of extremist groups like the Taliban.</p>
  <p>However, India's relationship with Afghanistan has increasingly become strained due to the Taliban's resurgence in the country. India has responded by ramping up its security cooperation with Afghanistan and by increasing its support for the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF).</p>
  <h3>India and Nepal</h3>
  <p>India's relationship with Nepal has also been complicated in recent years. In 2015, Nepal adopted a new constitution that was perceived by India as discriminatory against the Madhesi community, an ethnic minority with close ties to India. India responded by imposing an economic blockade on Nepal, which lasted for several months and severely impacted the country's economy.</p>
  <p>Since then, India has sought to repair its relationship with Nepal. In 2018, India's Prime Minister Modi paid a visit to Nepal and inaugurated several development projects in the country. India has also increased its security cooperation with Nepal, providing training and equipment to the Nepalese army and police force.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The Indian government's strong and decisive foreign policy has been critical in maintaining regional stability and countering the influence of extremist groups. India has sought to establish partnerships with other nations to counter common threats, such as terrorism and China's growing influence in the region. While India's approach to regional security may sometimes be disruptive, its commitment to maintaining regional stability remains unwavering.</p>
  <p>In summary, the main takeaways from Rajnath Singh's statement on Narendra Modi's leadership are:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>India's foreign policy is characterized by strength and decisiveness</li>
   <li>The country seeks to maintain regional stability and counter common threats</li>
   <li>India is committed to building strong partnerships with other nations to achieve these goals</li>
  </ol>
