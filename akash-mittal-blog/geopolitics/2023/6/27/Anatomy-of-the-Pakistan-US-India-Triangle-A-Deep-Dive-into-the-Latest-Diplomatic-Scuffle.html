  <p>In a dramatic turn of events, Pakistan summoned the US deputy mission chief after the US-India joint statement criticizing Pakistan for its role in promoting terrorism. This latest diplomatic scuffle highlights the complicated relationships between Pakistan, India, and the US. To understand the current situation, we need to take a deep dive into the history of these relationships, the geopolitical and economic factors at play, and the long-standing conflicts that continue to shape the region.</p>
  <h2>The Historical Perspective</h2>
  <p>The history of Pakistan and India goes back thousands of years, with the Indus Valley civilization and the Vedic period shaping the culture and traditions of the region. The two countries share a common border, a common language (Hindi-Urdu), and a common history of British colonial rule. However, they also have a long-standing rivalry that can be traced back to the partition of India in 1947 and the creation of Pakistan as a separate Muslim state.</p>
  <p>The partition was one of the bloodiest and most traumatic events in the history of South Asia, with millions of people displaced, killed, or injured. The two countries have fought several wars since then, including the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, which resulted in the creation of Bangladesh. The Kashmir conflict, which dates back to 1947, remains one of the most contentious issues between the two countries, with both sides accusing each other of aggression, human rights violations, and terrorism.</p>
  <h2>The Geopolitical and Economic Factors</h2>
  <p>The geopolitical and economic factors that shape the Pakistan-US-India triangle are complex and multifaceted. On the one hand, Pakistan and the US have had a strategic partnership since the Cold War era, with the US providing military and economic aid in exchange for Pakistan's support in containing Soviet influence in the region. However, this relationship has been strained by the US war on terror, and Pakistan's perceived lack of commitment to fighting extremist groups such as the Taliban and the Haqqani network.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, India and the US have been forging closer ties in recent years, with the US recognizing India as a major global player and a reliable partner in promoting democracy, human rights, and economic growth. The US-India relationship has also been driven by the need to counterbalance China's rising influence in Asia, as well as to promote trade and investment between the two countries.</p>
  <h2>The Long-Standing Conflicts</h2>
  <p>The long-standing conflicts between Pakistan and India, as well as between Pakistan and the US, have further complicated the geopolitics of the region. The Kashmir conflict, which has been called the "nuclear flashpoint" of South Asia, remains unresolved despite several attempts at peace talks and negotiations. The US and Pakistan also have a complicated relationship, with the US accusing Pakistan of playing a double game in the war on terror, and Pakistan accusing the US of violating its sovereignty and interfering in its internal affairs.</p>
  <p>In recent years, the rise of extremist groups such as ISIS and Al Qaeda has added another layer of complexity to the situation, with these groups seeking to destabilize the region and spread their influence. The recent attack on the Kabul airport, which was carried out by ISIS-K, underscored the need for regional cooperation in countering terrorism and extremism.</p>
  <h2>The Way Forward</h2>
  <p>Given the complex history, geopolitics, and conflicts that shape the Pakistan-US-India triangle, finding a way forward will not be easy. However, there are a few key steps that all stakeholders can take to improve the situation:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Respect each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity</li>
   <li>Seek to resolve the long-standing conflicts through dialogue, negotiation, and compromise</li>
   <li>Cooperate in countering terrorism and extremism, and promote economic growth and development</li>
  </ol>
  <p>By working towards these goals, Pakistan, India, and the US can create a more stable and prosperous region, and help to build a better future for their people.</p>
