  <h1>The US-India Nexus Against Pakistan</h1></br> <img src="images/US-India-Nexus-Against-Pakistan.jpeg" alt="+US-India-Nexus-Against-Pakistan+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://dailytimes.com.pk/1107578/us-india-nexus-against-pakistan/" target="_blank" href="https://dailytimes.com.pk/1107578/us-india-nexus-against-pakistan/" rel="noopener">https://dailytimes.com.pk/1107578/us-india-nexus-against-pakistan/</a></span></h5>
  <p>It was a chilly winter morning in Islamabad when the news broke that the United States had signed a military cooperation agreement with India. As a Pakistani national, I couldn't help feeling uneasy about the news. After all, India and Pakistan have been sparring for decades, and the United States has been Pakistan's purported ally in the region for almost as long.</p>
  <p>But as it turns out, my fears were not unfounded. The US-India nexus against Pakistan has been a growing concern in recent years, with both countries teaming up to isolate and destabilize Pakistan both politically and economically.</p>
  <h2>Examples of US-India Nexus Against Pakistan</h2>
  <p>One major example of the US-India nexus against Pakistan is the way in which the two countries have been working to isolate Pakistan diplomatically. The United States, for its part, has been pushing Pakistan to crack down on so-called terrorist organizations within its borders. Meanwhile, India has been lobbying other countries to cut off ties with Pakistan altogether, citing its alleged support for those same terrorist groups.</p>
  <p>Another example of the US-India nexus against Pakistan is the way in which the two countries have been working to undermine the Pakistani economy. India, for example, has been encouraging other countries to invest in Pakistan's arch-rival, China, instead of in Pakistan itself. Meanwhile, the United States has been imposing sanctions on Pakistani businesses and individuals in an attempt to cripple the Pakistani economy from the top down.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies of US-India Nexus Against Pakistan</h2>
  <h3>US Sanctions on Pakistani Individuals</h3>
  <p>In 2020, the United States imposed sanctions on a number of Pakistani individuals and companies, citing their alleged involvement in terrorist activities. Among those targeted were former Pakistani interior minister Rehman Malik and the country's Director General of Military Intelligence, Asad Munir. These moves by the United States were widely seen as an attempt to pressure Pakistan into cracking down harder on militants within its borders, and to destabilize the Pakistani government.</p>
  <h3>India's Diplomatic Push Against Pakistan</h3>
  <p>India has also been working hard to isolate Pakistan diplomatically, both through its own efforts and with the help of the United States. One example of this was India's successful lobbying efforts to get the United Arab Emirates to not only cut off all diplomatic ties with Pakistan, but also to return several Pakistani nationals who had been living in the UAE for years to Pakistan itself.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The US-India nexus against Pakistan is a worrying development, which has the potential to destabilize the entire South Asian region. It is clear that both countries are working to isolate and undermine Pakistan, both politically and economically. As such, it is up to the Pakistani people and government to resist these efforts and to find ways to build a stronger, more independent Pakistan, which can stand on its own two feet in the face of external pressures.</p>
