  <p>Once upon a time, there was a small country called India, which was ignored by most of the developed nations in the world. However, the arrival of Prime Minister Narendra Modi brought a significant change in India's diplomatic relations with other countries. His recent visit to the United States and Egypt has been a game-changer for India's foreign policy.</p>
  <h2>Importance of PM Modi's visits</h2>
  <p>Prime Minister Modi's visit to the United States was significant in many ways. He attended the Quad summit, which is a security partnership between the United States, Japan, Australia, and India. The summit aimed to strengthen the bond between the countries to counter growing threats from China. It also saw the signing of several important deals between India and the US, including the clean energy partnership, which reinforces India's commitment to clean energy transition.</p>
  <p>Similarly, Prime Minister Modi's visit to Egypt was also a crucial milestone in India's diplomatic relations. He met President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and discussed ways to enhance the relationship between the two countries. India also signed several MoUs with Egypt in various fields such as trade, education, and health. These agreements will strengthen the bond between the two countries and create new opportunities for cooperation.</p>
