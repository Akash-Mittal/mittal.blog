  <h1>Saudi Aramco sees 'sound' oil outlook for H2 on China, India demand</h1></br> <img src="images/Saudi-Aramco-sees-sound-oil-outlook-for-H2-on-China-India-demand.jpeg" alt="+Saudi-Aramco-sees-sound-oil-outlook-for-H2-on-China-India-demand+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/global-oil-market-fundamentals-sound-rest-2023-aramco-ceo-2023-06-26/" target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/global-oil-market-fundamentals-sound-rest-2023-aramco-ceo-2023-06-26/" rel="noopener">https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/global-oil-market-fundamentals-sound-rest-2023-aramco-ceo-2023-06-26/</a></span></h5>
  <p>When Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil producer, states that it sees a sound oil outlook for the second half of the year, companies and investors around the globe take notice. But what exactly makes this outlook sound?</p>
  <p>According to Aramco CEO Amin Nasser, the answer lies in the fast-growing demand from China and India. Both countries have consistently shown a strong appetite for oil, with India recently overtaking China as the world's largest importer of crude oil. As these economies steadily grow, so will their energy requirements, which will in turn drive demand for oil during the latter half of the year.</p>
  <h2>The China factor</h2>
  <p>After nearly three decades of unparalleled economic growth, China is currently the world's second-largest economy. The country's rapid expansion has been largely fuelled by oil, with demand growing at an average annual rate of 5.4% over the past 10 years. China's love affair with oil has not come without a cost, however. The country's ecological footprint is now among the largest in the world, with pollution and carbon emissions causing public health crises and environmental damage.</p>
  <p>But while the Chinese government has committed to cutting back on fossil fuels, the process will be slow and steady. It will take time for China's renewable energy industry to mature and scale up, which means that oil will continue to play a crucial role in the country's economy over the coming years.</p>
  <h2>The Indian surge</h2>
  <p>India's economic ascent has been no less impressive than China's. The country is projected to overtake Japan as the world's third-largest economy in the next decade, with growth rates consistently above 7% over the past five years. Like China, India is a massive consumer of energy, and primarily depends on oil for its transportation needs. However, the country is also focusing on renewables, with a goal of producing 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless, India's renewable energy industry is not yet mature enough to replace oil entirely, and the government continues to invest in its oil and gas sector. As India seeks to cement its place as a global economic power, it will need increasing amounts of energy to fuel its growth. In the short term, oil will remain a crucial part of the country's energy mix.</p>
  <h2>Case studies: China and India</h2>
  <p>Two case studies demonstrate the growing importance of China and India in the global oil industry.</p>
  <h3>Case study 1: Saudi Aramco signs refinery deals with Chinese companies</h3>
  <p>In February 2021, Saudi Aramco signed a memorandum of understanding with China's state-owned companies to build a large refinery and petrochemical complex in northeastern China. Construction of the facility is expected to begin later this year, with the complex projected to have a refining capacity of 300,000 barrels per day.</p>
  <p>This deal is just the latest sign of the growing relationship between Saudi Arabia and China, which is becoming an increasingly important partner for the oil-rich kingdom.</p>
  <h3>Case study 2: Indian oil imports surge despite COVID-19 pandemic</h3>
  <p>India's appetite for oil shows no signs of slowing down, even in the face of a global pandemic. In February 2021, the country imported 4.8 million barrels per day of crude oil, a 7.4% increase over the same period last year. This is despite the fact that India's economy has been hit hard by COVID-19, highlighting the country's continued reliance on oil as an economic driver.</p>
  <h2>The sound outlook, in three points</h2>
  <p>Based on the trends in China and India, we can identify the following reasons why Saudi Aramco sees a sound oil outlook for the second half of the year:</p>
  <ol>
   <li><strong>Strong demand:</strong> Both China and India continue to demonstrate a strong need for oil to fuel their rapidly growing economies. As they continue to develop, demand is only set to increase.</li>
   <li><strong>Slow shift to renewables:</strong> While both countries are investing in renewable energy, the transition will be gradual. Oil will remain a crucial part of their energy mix for the foreseeable future.</li>
   <li><strong>Stability in the oil market:</strong> With OPEC+ successfully managing production cuts, the global oil market has stabilized, providing a stable environment for companies like Saudi Aramco to operate in.</li>
  </ol>
