   <p>Once upon a time, there was a small country named Bhutan. It had a long-standing territorial dispute with its giant neighbor - China. In June 2017, the Chinese army entered a disputed area between Bhutan and China and started building a road. Bhutan asked for India's help since it is a close ally of Bhutan. In response, India sent troops to the border and stopped the Chinese construction. This incident escalated tensions between India and China.</p>
   <p>Since then, China has been showcasing its military might in the Indo-Pacific region. It has been building artificial islands in the South China Sea, claiming sovereignty over the entire region. It has been increasing its naval presence in the Indian Ocean. It has been supporting Pakistan, India's arch-rival, with weapons and economic aid. It has been wary of India's growing ties with the United States, especially in the defence sector.</p>
   <p>Recently, China gave a warning to India about its defence deals with the United States. China's foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, said, "We hope that the relevant sides can proceed from the strategic stability of the region, be cautious with their words and actions, and not do things that will escalate regional tensions."</p>
   <p>China's warning came after India and the United States signed the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) on 27 October 2020. BECA is an enabling agreement that will facilitate the sharing of military information, including satellite and topographical data. It is the fourth and final foundational agreement between India and the United States, after the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) in 2002, the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) in 2016, and the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) in 2018.</p>
   <h2>Examples of China's Concerns</h2>
   <p>China is concerned about India's cooperation with the United States in the defence sector. It believes that such cooperation is aimed at containing China's rise as a global power. China has been voicing its objections to the Indo-US defence deals for quite some time now.</p>
   <p>For example, in 2016, when India and the United States signed the LEMOA, China's Global Times commented, "The deal will bring India into the US' embrace and shake the balance of power in the region. As a result, China will have to re-consider its regional strategy." Similarly, in 2018, when India and the United States signed the COMCASA, China's foreign ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying, said, "We hope the relevant cooperation between the relevant countries can be conducive to regional peace and stability, and play a constructive role in this regard."</p>
   <h2>Case Studies of India's Defence Deals</h2>
   <p>India has been expanding its defence cooperation with the United States in recent years. It has been purchasing weapons and equipment from the United States, signing defence agreements, and engaging in joint military exercises. Here are some case studies of India's defence deals:</p>
   <h3>Case Study 1: Apache Attack Helicopters</h3>
   <p>In 2018, India signed a contract with the United States to purchase 22 Apache attack helicopters. The deal was worth $1.4 billion. The Apache helicopters are considered to be one of the most advanced attack helicopters in the world. They will enhance India's military capabilities in the air.</p>
   <h3>Case Study 2: C-130J Super Hercules Aircraft</h3>
   <p>In 2011, India signed a contract with the United States to purchase six C-130J Super Hercules aircraft. The deal was worth $1.06 billion. The aircraft are used for special operations, search and rescue, and disaster relief. They have been used by India in various missions, including the rescue of Indian nationals during the Yemen crisis in 2015.</p>
   <h3>Case Study 3: Malabar Naval Exercise</h3>
   <p>The Malabar naval exercise is a joint naval exercise between India, the United States, and Japan. It started in 1992 as a bilateral exercise between India and the United States. Japan joined the exercise in 2015. The exercise is aimed at enhancing interoperability between the three navies and maintaining regional peace and stability. The exercise has been held in various locations, such as the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea, and the Western Pacific.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>China's warning to India about its defence deals with the United States is not surprising. China is exercising its influence in the Indo-Pacific region, and India is seen as a key player in this region. India's cooperation with the United States in the defence sector is aimed at enhancing its military capabilities and maintaining regional peace and stability. India has been balancing its relationships with various countries, including China, the United States, Russia, and Japan. India's strategic autonomy and its ability to pursue its national interests are crucial in this complex geopolitical environment.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, here are three key points to consider:</p>

    <li>India's cooperation with the United States in the defence sector is aimed at enhancing its military capabilities and maintaining regional peace and stability.</li>
