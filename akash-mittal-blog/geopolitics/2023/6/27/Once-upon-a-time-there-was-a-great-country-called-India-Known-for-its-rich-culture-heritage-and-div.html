  <h1>Once upon a time, there was a great country called India. Known for its rich culture, heritage and diversity, it draws visitors from all over the world. Recently, India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, visited the land of ancient history and wonders, Egypt. His meeting with President Al Sisi marked the first visit of an Indian Prime Minister to Egypt in 26 years. The Visit, has several points of significance that will shape the relations between the two countries in the years to come.</h1></br> <img src="images/Once-upon-a-time-there-was-a-great-country-called-India-Known-for-its-rich-culture-heritage-and-div.jpeg" alt="+Once-upon-a-time-there-was-a-great-country-called-India-Known-for-its-rich-culture-heritage-and-div+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://morningexpress.in/pm-narendra-modi-meets-president-al-sisi-in-cairo-first-visit-of-indian-prime-minister-to-egypt-in-26-years/" target="_blank" href="https://morningexpress.in/pm-narendra-modi-meets-president-al-sisi-in-cairo-first-visit-of-indian-prime-minister-to-egypt-in-26-years/" rel="noopener">https://morningexpress.in/pm-narendra-modi-meets-president-al-sisi-in-cairo-first-visit-of-indian-prime-minister-to-egypt-in-26-years/</a></span></h5>
  <p></p>
  <p>India and Egypt share many common interests and also several challenges, ranging from security, economic development, counter-terrorism, and climate change. Therefore, the meeting between the two leaders has great potential for mutual cooperation and understanding. The Indian Prime Minister's visit to Egypt reflects India's growing interest in strengthening ties with nations in the Middle East and underscored India's commitment to contribute to peace and stability in the region.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>India and Egypt have an age-old relationship, dating back to over 5000 years. Both the countries share many cultural and religious similarities. Given the historical and cultural links, the relationship between India and Egypt has been a friendly one. Moreover, Egypt has always viewed India as an appropriate voice to represent the developing world in international forums. India and Egypt remain two of the largest and most diversified economies among the southern countries. It is no surprise that Japan and India have announced substantial investments to Africa and supporting African owners and entrepreneurs in bringing their vision for development into reality in 2016.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>India is the largest consumer of gold in the world and Egypt also has significant reserves of it. Cooperation in the mining of gold takes an added significance with considerable savings in foreign exchange for both countries possible while creating job opportunities and employment in the field.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Furthermore, as energy prices across the globe are seeing a slump, Egyptian oil and natural gas reserves become important for India that is trying to balance both economic and energy security concerns. Both Egypt and India have a shared vision to become a hub for affordable and accessible energy.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, the visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Egypt has put a renewed focus on the relationship between the two countries and rightly so. It can be a game changer if rightly pursued by both countries. The visit is an excellent opportunity for both to build on their historic relations, and then the aim should be to transform these into a dynamic, mutually beneficial partnership for the changing times. The signing of agreements on mutually beneficial issues emphasizes the deepening of bilateral relations between the two countries. The way ahead is a stronger partnership that can benefit the masses of both nations and contribute positively to international peace and stability.</p>
