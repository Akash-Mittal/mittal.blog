  <h1>China and New Zealand: Strengthening Trade Ties</h1></br> <img src="images/China-and-New-Zealand-Strengthening-Trade-Ties.jpeg" alt="+China-and-New-Zealand-Strengthening-Trade-Ties+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://asianews.network/china-new-zealand-willing-to-advance-trade-growth-agreements/" target="_blank" href="https://asianews.network/china-new-zealand-willing-to-advance-trade-growth-agreements/" rel="noopener">https://asianews.network/china-new-zealand-willing-to-advance-trade-growth-agreements/</a></span></h5>
  <p>Once upon a time, there was a land teeming with natural resources and a vast population - that land was China. On the other side of the world, there was a beautiful and peaceful island called New Zealand. Despite the distance between them, these two countries have forged a strong bond, driven by their shared commitment to advancing trade growth and agreements.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Collaborations</h2>
  <p>One of the most significant trade agreements between China and New Zealand is the China-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which was signed in 2008. Under this agreement, tariffs on 96% of New Zealand's exports to China were eliminated, while tariffs on 8,000 Chinese goods were also reduced or eliminated.</p>
  <p>Since the signing of the FTA, bilateral trade between the two countries has grown rapidly. In 2019, China was New Zealand's top trading partner, accounting for almost a third of all exports. As of 2021, New Zealand is China's largest dairy supplier and a significant source of wool, beef, wine, and timber.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>A prominent example of China-New Zealand cooperation is Fonterra, a multinational dairy co-operative owned by over 10,000 farmers in New Zealand. Fonterra has been a significant exporter of dairy products to China since the early 2000s and now boasts over 1,000 employees in China across various branches, including food services, ingredients, and consumer products.</p>
  <p>Another example is the Wellington-based company Weta Digital, best known for producing award-winning special effects for blockbuster movies such as The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. Weta Digital has collaborated with Chinese companies to produce special effects for a growing number of Chinese productions, including the hit movie The Wandering Earth.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion in Three Points</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>The China-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement has significantly improved bilateral trade between the two countries.</li>
   <li>Many New Zealand companies have successfully entered the Chinese market, with dairy co-operative Fonterra and special effects studio Weta Digital as prominent examples.</li>
   <li>Continued collaboration between China and New Zealand is expected to further advance trade growth and agreements in the future.</li>
