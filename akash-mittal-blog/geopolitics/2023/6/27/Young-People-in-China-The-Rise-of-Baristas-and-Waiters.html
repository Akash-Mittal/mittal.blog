    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>In China, the pressure to succeed can be overwhelming for young people. Many of them strive to get high-paying jobs in prestigious fields such as finance, engineering, or law. However, in recent years, there has been a surprising trend among millennials in China: they are giving up their high-paying jobs to become baristas and waiters.</p>
    <p>This shift in career aspirations has sparked discussions online, as more and more young people are sharing their stories on social media and blogs. Instead of focusing on climbing the corporate ladder and making a lot of money, they are now seeking a simpler life with less stress and more creativity.</p>
    <p>What motivates these young people to make such a dramatic career change? How are they adapting to their new roles? And what does this trend say about the changing priorities of millennials in China?</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>One example of this trend is 26-year-old Wang Yiwei, who used to work as a programmer for a big tech company in Beijing. He was making a six-figure salary but felt burnt out and unfulfilled. Last year, he quit his job and opened a small coffee shop.</p>
    <p>Another example is 28-year-old Liu Xiaohui, who used to work in public relations for a luxury brand in Shanghai. She was making a good salary but was tired of the long hours and office politics. She quit her job and started working as a waitress in a vegan restaurant, where she enjoys the laid-back atmosphere and the chance to meet new people.</p>
    <p>These are just two examples of the many young people in China who are choosing to leave their high-paying jobs for a simpler life as a barista or waiter. They are part of a broader movement of millennials who are redefining success and happiness on their own terms.</p>
