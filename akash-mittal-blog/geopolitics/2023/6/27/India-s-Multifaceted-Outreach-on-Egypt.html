  <p>India and Egypt share a long-standing history of cultural, economic, and political ties. The relationship between the two countries dates back to ancient times when trade flourished between the civilizations of the Nile and the Indus. Today, India's multifaceted outreach on Egypt encompasses various areas such as trade, defence, education, culture, and tourism, strengthening the bilateral relationship even further.</p>
  <h3>An Interesting Story</h3>
  <p>When Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Egypt in 2016, he presented Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi with a bas-relief depicting the famous Egyptian queen, Nefertiti, and an eighteenth-century map of the Indian Ocean region, with India at the centre. The gift was a symbol of the centuries-old relationship between the two civilizations, the shared cultural heritage, and the promising future of cooperation between India and Egypt.</p><img src="nefertiti.jpg" alt="Bas-Relief of Nefertiti">
  <p>The bas-relief of Nefertiti was sculpted during the reign of Pharaoh Akhenaten in the fourteenth century BCE and is one of the most iconic works of art from ancient Egypt. The map, on the other hand, was created by Lieutenant James Rennell in 1783 and shows the Indian Ocean region, including the coasts of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, India, and Southeast Asia.</p>
  <h3>Examples of India's Multifaceted Outreach on Egypt</h3>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>Trade:</strong> India is one of Egypt's top trading partners, and the bilateral trade volume has been steadily increasing over the years. In 2020, despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the bilateral trade between India and Egypt reached USD 3.5 billion. Indian businesses have been investing in various sectors in Egypt, such as pharmaceuticals, information technology, textiles, and food processing.</li>
   <li><strong>Defence:</strong> Defence cooperation between India and Egypt has been strengthening in recent years. In 2018, India and Egypt signed a memorandum of understanding on defence cooperation, which includes joint training, exercises, and capacity building. Egypt has also purchased various defence equipment from India, such as the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile, T-90 tanks, and C-295 transport aircraft.</li>
   <li><strong>Education:</strong> India has been providing scholarships to Egyptian students to study in Indian universities under the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) Scholarship Scheme. The ICCR also sponsors Indian cultural events and festivals in Egypt, promoting cultural exchange between the two countries.</li>
   <li><strong>Culture:</strong> India and Egypt have a shared cultural heritage, and the two countries have been promoting cultural exchange through various initiatives. The Maulana Azad Centre for Indian Culture in Cairo is a cultural hub that organizes concerts, exhibitions, film screenings, and other cultural events. The centre also offers courses in Indian classical music and dance, yoga, and Hindi language.</li>
   <li><strong>Tourism:</strong> India and Egypt have been promoting tourism between the two countries. Indian tourists visit Egypt to see the ancient wonders such as the Pyramids, the Sphinx, and the temples of Luxor and Karnak. Similarly, Egyptian tourists visit India to see the monuments such as the Taj Mahal, the Red Fort, and the Qutub Minar.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Case Studies</h3>
  <p><strong>Trade:</strong> In 2017, Indian pharmaceutical company Strides Shasun acquired a controlling stake in Egyptian firm Rashid for Pharmaceuticals and Chemical Industries (RPIC). The acquisition provided Strides Shasun with a foothold in the Egyptian market and enabled it to expand its operations in the African continent. RPIC, on the other hand, benefited from Strides Shasun's expertise in research and development, manufacturing, and distribution.</p>
  <p><strong>Defence:</strong> In 2019, the Indian Army participated in the Egypt-led Multinational Exercise Bright Star. The exercise, which was held in Egypt, aimed to enhance the interoperability and cooperation among the participating countries' armed forces. The Indian Army participated in various joint training exercises, such as urban combat, live firing, and explosive ordnance disposal.</p>
  <p><strong>Education:</strong> In 2017, Mohamed Mahmoud Abdel Salam, an Egyptian student, received a scholarship from the ICCR to pursue a master's degree in economics at the University of Delhi. During his stay in India, Abdel Salam obtained a deep understanding of the Indian economy and also learned Hindi. After completing his degree, Abdel Salam returned to Egypt and joined the Central Bank of Egypt as an economist.</p>
  <p><strong>Culture:</strong> In 2018, the Maulana Azad Centre for Indian Culture in Cairo organized a weeklong festival of Indian classical music and dance. The festival featured performances by renowned Indian artists, such as classical vocalist Ustad Rashid Khan and Kathak dancer Pandit Birju Maharaj. The festival attracted a large audience and received widespread media coverage in Egypt.</p>
  <p><strong>Tourism:</strong> In 2019, the Egyptian Tourism Promotion Board launched a campaign in India titled "This is Egypt," which aimed to attract more Indian tourists to Egypt. The campaign showcased Egypt's diverse tourist attractions, such as its ancient monuments, beaches, and natural wonders. As a result of the campaign, the number of Indian tourists visiting Egypt increased by 27% in 2019 compared to the previous year.</p>
