    <p>India has the potential to become a global leader in renewable energy, with its abundance of sunshine, wind and water resources. However, the country is facing a major obstacle in achieving this goal due to its tumultuous relationship with Pakistan.</p>
    <p>The two countries have been engaged in a bitter conflict over the disputed region of Kashmir for decades, with frequent skirmishes and attacks along the border. This has led to a situation where any major infrastructure project in India's border states, such as those aimed at harnessing renewable energy, is seen as a potential national security threat.</p>
    <p>For example, the proposed 850 MW Ratle Hydroelectric Project in Kashmir has been facing delays since 2015 due to protests from Pakistan, which claims that it violates the Indus Waters Treaty. Similarly, the proposed 600 MW Kishanganga Hydroelectric Power Project faced several legal challenges from Pakistan before it was allowed to proceed in 2018.</p>

    <h2>Examples of the Impact</h2>
    <p>The impact of Pakistan's turmoil on India's green energy potential can be seen in several ways:</p>
    <ul>
     <li><strong>Delay in Projects:</strong> As mentioned before, several renewable energy projects in the border states of India have been facing delays due to objections from Pakistan. This has resulted in a loss of time and money for the Indian government and private investors.</li>
     <li><strong>Higher Costs:</strong> The delays and uncertainty surrounding these projects have also led to higher costs, which ultimately get passed on to the consumers. This makes renewable energy less attractive compared to conventional sources of energy like coal and oil.</li>
     <li><strong>Missed Targets:</strong> India has set ambitious targets for itself in terms of renewable energy generation, such as 175 GW by 2022 and 450 GW by 2030. However, the current state of affairs suggests that these targets may not be achieved, at least not within the timeframe set.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>The impact of Pakistan's turmoil can be further illustrated through some specific case studies:</p>
    <h3>Case Study 1: Ratle Hydroelectric Project</h3>
    <p>The Ratle Hydroelectric Project is located along the Chenab River in Jammu and Kashmir. The project was awarded to a consortium of Indian companies in 2014 and was expected to be completed by 2020. However, due to objections from Pakistan, the project has been halted since 2015. The Indian government had to intervene in 2020, and the project is expected to be completed by 2024, which is a delay of four years.</p>
    <h3>Case Study 2: Kishanganga Hydroelectric Power Project</h3>
    <p>The Kishanganga Hydroelectric Power Project is located along the Kishanganga River in Jammu and Kashmir. The project was initiated in 2007 but faced legal challenges from Pakistan, which claimed that it violated the Indus Waters Treaty. The case went to the International Court of Justice, which ruled in favor of India in 2013. The project was finally completed in 2018, after a delay of 11 years.</p>
    <h3>Case Study 3: Tulbul Navigation Project</h3>
    <p>The Tulbul Navigation Project is located along the Jhelum River in Jammu and Kashmir. It aims to develop a navigation canal that would be used by small boats to transport goods and people. The project was started in 1990 but was halted in 2007 due to objections from Pakistan, which claimed that it would affect the flow of water to Pakistan. The project is still suspended, and no progress has been made in the past 13 years.</p>
