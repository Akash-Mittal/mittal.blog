  <p>Journalism is the backbone of every democratic society, as it helps people to stay informed and make informed decisions. Journalists are the torchbearers of truth and hold immense power to influence people's perspectives. However, in recent times, many countries are finding it difficult to accommodate foreign journalists, especially when their reports don't align with their national interests.</p>
  <h2>The Recent Event</h2>
  <p>China recently asked two Indian journalists to leave the country, citing "unfair treatment" of its reporters in India and accusing them of indulging in activities that "violated the norms of professional ethics."</p>
  <p>The move has been widely criticized by the Indian media fraternity, calling it an attack on the freedom of press and an attempt to curb voices that question the Chinese government's policies and actions.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Countries Restricting Foreign Journalists</h2>
  <p>China is not the only country that has come under fire for restricting foreign journalists. North Korea, for instance, has always been reclusive and heavily controlled its narrative by keeping international journalists at bay. Iran has also been seen to have a heavy-handed approach on journalists who try to report on sensitive issues such as human rights and corruption.</p>
  <p>Recently, Belarus was declared the most dangerous country for journalists by the International Press Institute, citing the number of journalists who were harassed, arrested, or detained in the country for reporting on the anti-government protests.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>One of the most significant cases of journalists facing censorship and harassment in recent years was the gruesome murder of Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey in 2018.</p>
  <p>Khashoggi was a critic of the Saudi government and had been writing articles for the Washington Post that were critical of the government's policies. He was brutally murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, and it is believed that the Saudi government was responsible for the murder.</p>
  <p>The incident raised concerns about the safety of journalists worldwide and the extent to which governments can go to silence their critics.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>The freedom of the press is crucial for a healthy democracy, and governments that restrict such freedom should be viewed with suspicion.</li>
   <li>Journalists are the watchdogs of society, and they play a vital role in ensuring accountability and transparency in the functioning of the government.</li>
   <li>It is essential for the international community to come together and condemn such actions by repressive governments and ensure that journalists can practice their profession without fear of reprisals.</li>
