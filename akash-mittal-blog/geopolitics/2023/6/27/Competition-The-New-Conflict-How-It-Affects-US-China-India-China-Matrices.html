  <p>Amid escalating trade war and geopolitical tensions, competition between countries has become the new conflict. The US-China, India-China matrices are no exception to this. The competition has created a ripple effect across multiple sectors, leaving economies and businesses vulnerable to the consequences.</p>
  <p>Let's explore this situation in more detail with some examples and case studies.</p>
  <h2>An interesting story to get started</h2>
  <p>Imagine two highly competitive chefs working at separate restaurants. One chef decides to use a new exotic spice in his dishes, which instantly attracts customers and leads to an increase in revenue. In response, the other chef starts using the same spice but pairs it with a more unique ingredient to outdo his competitor. This leads to a healthy competition between two chefs, in turn creating more variety in dishes and better customer experience.</p>
  <p>However, imagine if the competition turns sour, and one chef starts using illegal tactics like spreading rumors or sabotaging their competitor's business. This would ruin the spirit of competition and create a hostile environment between both restaurants, ultimately leading to a loss of revenue for both.</p>
  <p>Similarly, competition between countries can be positive when it leads to innovation and growth. But when it turns hostile and both countries resort to illegal tactics, it leads to an adversarial relationship and results in losses for both countries.</p>
  <h2>Examples of competition as the new conflict</h2>
  <p>The US-China trade war is a perfect example of how competition has become the new conflict. The trade war initiated due to disputes over trade imbalances, intellectual property theft, and national security, has escalated to a point where both countries have imposed massive tariffs on imported goods, leading to a rise in prices for consumers and hurting businesses on both sides.</p>
  <p>India-China tense military stand-off in the Doklam region is another instance where the competition between the countries has led to a conflict situation. The stand-off resulted from China's attempt to construct a road in Doklam, which falls under Bhutan's territory but is claimed by China. This created a border dispute between India and China, resulting in a tense military stand-off with both countries deploying troops.</p>
  <h2>Case studies of competition affecting economies and businesses</h2>
  <p>The ongoing US-China trade war has caused disruptions across industries, with technology, agriculture, and manufacturing being the hardest hit. The tariffs have led to a decline in business confidence, a fall in stock markets, and a slowdown in economic growth.</p>
  <p>Similarly, the India-China border dispute, which has been ongoing for decades, has affected the economy of both countries. The border dispute has created an unstable environment between the countries, leading to a decline in trade and investment.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion in 3 points</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>Competition between countries can be positive, resulting in innovation and growth.</li>
   <li>However, if the competition turns hostile and both countries resort to illegal tactics, it leads to an adversarial relationship and results in losses for both.</li>
   <li>The US-China trade war and India-China border dispute are examples of how competition has become the new conflict, resulting in disruptions across industries and affecting economies and businesses.</li>
