  <p>Once upon a time, Russia heavily relied on developed nations to maintain its energy production and export. However, things changed when international sanctions were implemented against Russia after its annexation of Crimea in 2014. The country had to look for other markets to keep its energy economy afloat.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Developing-World Contacts</h2>
  <p>One of the examples of Russia's developing-world contacts is China, which has been an important partner in various energy fields. The two countries have significantly increased their cooperation in gas and oil production, transportation, and refining. Russia's oil giant Rosneft agreed to supply China's CNPC with up to 2.5 million tons of crude oil per year in 2020. The countries also launched Power of Siberia, a major gas pipeline project that supplies China with Russian gas.</p>
  <p>Russia has also been looking to other countries, such as India, Turkey, and Vietnam, to secure its energy economy. In particular, Russia's Rosatom has been helping these countries build nuclear power plants.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <h3>India</h3>
  <p>India and Russia have a long-standing relationship in the energy sector, which started with the construction of India's first nuclear power plant in the 1960s. In 2018, they signed a deal to build six more nuclear reactors in India, and Russia's Rosneft agreed to buy a 49% stake in Indian oil refiner Nayara Energy. These deals will strengthen India's energy security, and provide Russia with a wider market for its oil and gas exports.</p>
  <h3>Turkey</h3>
  <p>Turkey relies heavily on imported energy, and Russia is one of its main sources of natural gas. The two countries have been collaborating on energy projects, such as the TurkStream gas pipeline, which will transport Russian gas to Turkey and Europe. However, this partnership has also brought challenges, such as the 2015 Russian-Turkish jet incident, which threatened their energy cooperation. Nonetheless, they managed to resolve their issues and continue their energy partnership.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>Russia has been building relationships with developing countries to secure its energy economy, particularly in the fields of oil, gas, and nuclear power.</li>
   <li>These contacts have brought both benefits and challenges, such as stronger energy security for partner countries, and geopolitical risks for both Russia and partner countries.</li>
   <li>Nonetheless, Russia's developing-world contacts have been crucial in keeping its energy economy afloat, especially in the face of international sanctions and geopolitical tensions.</li>
