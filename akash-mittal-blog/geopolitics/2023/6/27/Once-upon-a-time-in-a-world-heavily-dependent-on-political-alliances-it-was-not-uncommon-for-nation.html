  <title>Once upon a time, in a world heavily dependent on political alliances, it was not uncommon for nations to summon representatives from other countries to deliver demarches. A demarche is essentially a formal diplomatic message that a nation sends to another, expressing its concern or discontent over a particular matter. In recent times, one such demarche has captured the attention of news outlets around the world: Pakistan summoning a US diplomat to deliver a demarche over last week's US-India joint statement.</title>

  <p></p>
  <p>The US-India joint statement in question was released towards the end of May 2021 and detailed the two nations' plans to strengthen their security partnership. Pakistan, however, took exception to the statement. According to the demarche delivered to the US diplomat, Pakistan feels that the statement "singles out" Pakistan and that it "demonizes" the country. The demarche further urges the US to "immediately review" its policies regarding Pakistan and to stop "using Pakistan's soil and territory" against other countries.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This demarche is just one example of the complexities of political alliances and the tensions that can arise between nations. The US and India have been strengthening their strategic partnership for years now, much to the displeasure of other nations in the region. China, for example, has expressed its concern over the US-India partnership and has accused the two nations of trying to contain China's rise. Similarly, Pakistan has long felt that the US is trying to undermine its sovereignty by siding with India.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In the case of the US-India joint statement, Pakistan's response is not entirely surprising. Pakistan has had a tumultuous relationship with the US in recent years, with tensions rising over issues such as Pakistan's alleged support for terrorist groups and the US's use of drone strikes in the country. The US-India partnership is seen as a threat to Pakistan's security and, given the history between the two nations, it is understandable why Pakistan would feel uneasy about the joint statement.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>But this demarche raises broader questions about the future of political alliances in the region. As the world becomes increasingly multipolar, with rising powers such as China and India vying for influence, it remains to be seen what role smaller nations like Pakistan will play. Will they be able to maintain their sovereignty in the face of growing pressure from larger nations, or will they be forced to align themselves with one or the other?</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case studies from other regions offer insights into these questions. In Southeast Asia, for example, smaller nations such as Vietnam and the Philippines have been trying to balance their relationships with China and the US. Vietnam, in particular, has been successful in playing both China and the US off each other, using its strategic location and growing economy to extract concessions from both sides. The Philippines, on the other hand, has struggled to balance its relationship with the two powers and has often found itself caught in the middle of their disputes.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In the Middle East, too, smaller nations have been forced to navigate the complexities of political alliances. Saudi Arabia, for example, has traditionally aligned itself with the US, but in recent years has started to pivot towards China and Russia. This shift has been driven in part by US policies towards Saudi Arabia, particularly in the wake of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Similarly, Iran has traditionally aligned itself with Russia, but has also cultivated ties with China in recent years.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>So what does the future hold for political alliances in the region? Here are three key takeaways:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Smaller nations will continue to play a critical role in shaping the global balance of power. Despite their size and resources, smaller nations have the ability to punch above their weight by aligning themselves strategically with larger powers. This will remain true even as the world becomes more multipolar.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. The success of such alliances will depend on a range of factors, including geography, economy, and politics. Smaller nations that are able to use their strategic location or growing economies to extract concessions from larger powers will be better positioned to navigate the complexities of political alliances.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. As tensions between major powers continue to rise, smaller nations will be forced to make tough choices about where to align themselves. Some, like Vietnam, will be able to maintain a delicate balance between multiple powers. Others, like the Philippines, will find themselves caught in the middle of bigger powers' disputes.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, the recent demarche delivered by Pakistan to a US diplomat over the US-India joint statement highlights the tensions that can arise between nations when political alliances shift. But this is just one example of a broader trend in the region and beyond. As the world becomes increasingly multipolar, smaller nations will continue to play a key role in shaping the global balance of power. Their success in doing so will depend on a range of factors, and tough choices will need to be made in the face of rising tensions between major powers.</p>
