    <p>It was a sunny day when the CEO of a renowned financial institute received a distressing phone call. The voice on the other end was frantic as they explained the urgent matter at hand. Their supercomputer had been hacked, and all their confidential data was at risk. The CEO couldn't believe it; their company had always been at the forefront of cybersecurity. Suddenly, it dawned on them; their highly encrypted data was no match for a quantum computer.</p>
    <p>Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize the world, but it also poses a significant threat to cybersecurity and encryption. A quantum computer's speed and processing power would make the current encryption methods redundant, jeopardizing sensitive data, ranging from financial institutions to government agencies. However, India's National Quantum Mission (NQM), launched in 2020, aims to tackle the security implications of quantum computing.</p>

    <h2>The Threat of Quantum Computing</h2>
    <p>Quantum computing operates on the principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike classical computers, quantum computers use "qubits" to process information. A qubit, unlike a bit, can exist in multiple states simultaneously, which provides exponential processing power. While classical computers use binary digits, quantum computers use "superposition" and "entanglement" to perform complex calculations. A quantum computer with 50 qubits can perform calculations that would require a classical computer with over a petabyte of RAM.</p>
    <p>However, this immense processing power also poses a significant threat to cybersecurity. Current encryption methods, such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm, rely on a private key that is generated using mathematical problems that classical computers cannot solve efficiently. However, quantum computers can solve these problems in a matter of seconds, making these encryption methods vulnerable to cyber-attacks.</p>

    <h2>The Security Implications</h2>
    <p>The security implications of quantum computing are far-reaching. Banking systems, government agencies, and other organizations that hold sensitive data will be at risk of cyber-attacks. Cyber hackers, who exploit the vulnerabilities in a company's cybersecurity system, will have more options to attack, and they may use quantum computing to break into systems that are currently impossible to penetrate.</p>
    <p>In 2019, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced that it was working on post-quantum cryptography standards. Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is a new set of cryptographic systems designed to withstand quantum attacks. NIST has released a list of contenders for new encryption standards, but it is still in the development phase. Companies and organizations need to be prepared for quantum computing, and PQC is an essential step to ensure data security in the post-quantum era.</p>

    <h2>India's National Quantum Mission</h2>
    <p>The Indian government launched the National Quantum Mission (NQM) in 2020, with an aim to accelerate quantum technology research and development in the country. The NQM's objective is to establish India as a global leader in quantum computing by developing quantum technologies, infrastructure, and a skilled workforce. The mission has a budget of 8,000 crores, which is one of the largest investments in quantum research globally.</p>
    <p>One of the primary objectives of the NQM is to address the potential security implications of quantum computing. The mission aims to develop quantum-safe solutions for data encryption, including PQC. The mission also aims to develop quantum-resistant cybersecurity systems that can detect and prevent cyber-attacks initiated by quantum computers.</p>
