  <p></p>
  <p>On 28 August 2021, the US President Joe Biden and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a virtual meeting that ended with a joint statement condemning the militant attack in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul. In the statement, they mentioned some groups that are believed to be behind the attack, including the Pakistan-based Haqqani Network (HN). The statement triggered an angry response from Pakistan, which summoned the US Deputy Mission Chief to protest against the comments.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Pakistan's Foreign Office spokesperson, Asim Iftikhar Ahmed, said in a statement that the "unwarranted reference to Pakistan in the joint statement" was "contrary to the spirit of cooperation" between the two countries in the Afghan peace process. He also stated that "such baseless allegations are not helpful for the shared objective of peace and stability in the region."</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This is not the first time Pakistan has accused the US of pointing fingers at it for terrorist attacks. The US has long been critical of Pakistan's alleged support for extremist groups such as the Taliban, the HN, and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Pakistani officials have repeatedly denied these allegations, saying that the US is scapegoating Pakistan for its own failures in Afghanistan.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>However, Pakistan's protest against the joint statement is not just about clearing its name and reputation. There are several underlying issues that need to be addressed in this diplomatic row. Let us explore them through examples and case studies.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Example 1: Pakistan's Role in Afghan Peace Process</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Pakistan has been a key player in the Afghan peace process, particularly in facilitating talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government. The US has acknowledged Pakistan's role in these talks, but it has also accused Pakistan of providing safe havens to the Taliban and other militant groups that attack US and Afghan forces.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Pakistan, on the other hand, has argued that it does not have complete control over the militant groups and that it is unfair to blame Pakistan for their actions. Pakistan has also urged the US to acknowledge its efforts in the peace process, instead of criticizing it.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case Study 1: Haqqani Network</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The HN is a militant group based in Pakistan that has been accused of carrying out several high-profile attacks in Afghanistan, including the 2019 attack on the US embassy in Kabul. The US has designated the group as a terrorist organization and has urged Pakistan to take action against it.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Pakistan has denied that the HN operates in its territory and has accused the US of using the group as a pretext for its military presence in Afghanistan. However, recent reports suggest that the HN has a significant presence in Pakistan, and that Pakistan's intelligence agency, the ISI, has close ties with the group.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Example 2: US-India Relations</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The joint statement by Biden and Modi is seen by many as a sign of growing ties between the US and India, particularly in countering China's rise in the region. The statement also highlights India's growing role in the Afghan peace process.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>However, Pakistan sees this as a threat to its own interests, particularly as it relies heavily on China for economic and military assistance. Pakistan has urged the US to remain neutral in the region and not to take sides.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case Study 2: Kashmir Conflict</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Pakistan and India have been embroiled in a long-standing conflict over the disputed region of Kashmir. The US has largely remained neutral in the conflict, but it has recently expressed concern over human rights violations in the region.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>India, on the other hand, has accused Pakistan of supporting separatist groups in Kashmir and has urged the US to pressurize Pakistan to stop its alleged support for these groups.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The diplomatic row between Pakistan and the US over the Biden-Modi joint statement is not just about clearing Pakistan's name; it is about several underlying issues that need to be addressed. These issues include Pakistan's role in the Afghan peace process, its alleged support for extremist groups, US-India relations, and the Kashmir conflict.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, three key points can be highlighted:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. The US needs to acknowledge Pakistan's efforts in the Afghan peace process and work with Pakistan to address its concerns.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Pakistan needs to take action against militant groups operating on its soil, including the HN.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. The US needs to avoid taking sides in regional conflicts and work towards a more neutral stance that promotes peace and stability in the region.</p>
