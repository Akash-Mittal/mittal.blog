  <p>Recently, Amit Shah, the Union Home Minister of India, briefed Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the situation in Manipur. The briefing must have been an important one considering the fact that a top-level minister had to personally come to New Delhi to brief the PM. Let's dive deep into what could be the issues that Shah might have discussed with Modi.</p>
  <h2>The Naga Peace Accord</h2>
  <p>The Naga Peace Accord is a framework agreement between the Government of India and the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-IM) signed on 3 August 2015. The agreement aims to resolve the seven-decade-long insurgency in Nagaland. However, the accord faces stiff opposition from several civil society groups, including major political parties.</p>
  <p>Manipur's Chief Minister N Biren Singh, in an interview with The Indian Express, stated that there should be no compromise on the territorial integrity of Manipur. He added that the NSCN-IM, which has its major stronghold in Nagaland, could become a threat to the peace and security of Manipur.</p>
  <h2>The Drug Menace</h2>
  <p>Manipur is known for drug trafficking, particularly along the India-Myanmar border. Easy availability of drugs and the lack of law enforcement have increased drug abuse among the youth in the state. The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown have increased the drug supply, with reports indicating that drug peddlers are now using online platforms to sell their products.</p>
  <p>Recently, the Narcotics and Affairs of Border (NAB) arrested eight individuals, including a woman, for their involvement in drug trafficking in Manipur. The NAB seized heroin and various other drugs worth Rs 29.5 crore (approx $4 million), making it the largest drug seizure in the state.</p>
  <h2>The Insurgency in Manipur</h2>
  <p>Manipur has been plagued by insurgency for several decades. Over the years, multiple militant outfits have emerged in the state, demanding separate statehood or greater autonomy from the Indian government. The militant outfits carry out bombings, shootings, and other attacks on security forces and civilians. The Indian Army is deployed in the state to combat insurgency.</p>
  <p>In January 2021, the Indian Army launched an operation against suspected militants in the Chandel district of Manipur. The operation, which lasted for several hours, resulted in the killing of six alleged militants. The militants were suspected to belong to the newly formed People's Liberation Army (PLA), which fights for greater autonomy for the Meitei community in Manipur.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>The Naga Peace Accord needs to be implemented, keeping in mind Manipur's territorial integrity.</li>
   <li>The drug menace needs to be tackled on a war footing, with strict law enforcement measures and preventive measures such as awareness campaigns.</li>
   <li>The insurgency in Manipur needs to be dealt with firmly but with caution, ensuring that innocent civilians are not harmed. The government needs to address the root causes of the insurgency and provide a roadmap for a peaceful settlement.</li>
  </ol>
