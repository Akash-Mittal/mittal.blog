  <h1>The Costly Return of Geopolitics</h1></br> <img src="images/The-Costly-Return-of-Geopolitics.jpeg" alt="+The-Costly-Return-of-Geopolitics+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="http://www.jordantimes.com/opinion/robert-skidelsky/costly-return-geopolitics" target="_blank" href="http://www.jordantimes.com/opinion/robert-skidelsky/costly-return-geopolitics" rel="noopener">http://www.jordantimes.com/opinion/robert-skidelsky/costly-return-geopolitics</a></span></h5>
  <p><span>It was a sunny afternoon in the Mediterranean when the warship appeared on the horizon. The small fishing boat that I was on with my colleagues suddenly found itself surrounded by heavily armed marines.</span></p>
  <p><span>Our research team had been investigating the impact of the Syrian conflict on the region's economy, and this unexpected encounter brought home the reality of geopolitics for us.</span></p>
  <p><span>In recent years, geopolitics has returned to the forefront of global attention. From the conflict in Syria to tensions in the South China Sea, the world is once again grappling with the complex interplay of politics, geography, and economics.</span></p>
  <h2>Examples of Geopolitical Tensions</h2>
  <p><span>One of the most high-profile examples of current geopolitical tensions is the ongoing dispute between China and the United States over trade. The two superpowers have been locked in a tit-for-tat battle over tariffs and technology, with no end in sight.</span></p>
  <p><span>The Middle East also continues to be a hotbed of geopolitical tensions. The conflict in Syria has drawn in various regional and global powers, while the ongoing rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran has fueled tensions across the Gulf region.</span></p>
  <p><span>In Europe, the rise of populist and nationalist movements has led to a resurgence of geopolitical tensions. The Brexit negotiations have highlighted the complex web of alliances and rivalries that exist on the continent, while the Ukraine crisis has underscored the power of geopolitical maneuvering.</span></p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p><span>The ongoing conflict in Syria provides a poignant case study of the impact of geopolitics on a country and its people. What began as a peaceful uprising against the authoritarian regime of Bashar al-Assad quickly spiraled into a multifaceted civil war that drew in various regional and global powers.</span></p>
  <p><span>The war in Syria has caused immense human suffering, with more than 500,000 people killed and 5 million refugees forced to flee the country. It has also had a significant impact on the regional economy, with neighboring countries such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey struggling to cope with the influx of refugees and the disruption to trade.</span></p>
  <p><span>The conflict has also highlighted the complex web of geopolitical rivalries that exist in the region. Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah have supported the Assad regime, while the United States, Saudi Arabia, and other Gulf states have backed the opposition. This has led to a dangerous escalation of tensions, with the potential to destabilize the entire region.</span></p>
  <h2>Conclusion: The High Cost of Geopolitics</h2>
  <p><span>The return of geopolitics has brought with it a high cost, both in terms of human suffering and economic disruption. As tensions mount between major powers and rival alliances form, the risk of conflict only grows.</span></p>
  <p><span>However, there is also a glimmer of hope. By working together to address shared challenges such as climate change and inequality, countries can build bridges across geopolitical divides.</span></p>
  <p><span>There are some key points to be made that summarize the argument in this article:</span></p>

   <li>Geopolitical tensions are on the rise, from the ongoing trade war between China and the United States to the conflict in Syria to the rise of nationalism in Europe.</li>
   <li>The high cost of geopolitical tensions is evident in terms of human suffering and economic disruption.</li>
   <li>Working together to address shared challenges can help to build bridges across geopolitical divides.</li>
