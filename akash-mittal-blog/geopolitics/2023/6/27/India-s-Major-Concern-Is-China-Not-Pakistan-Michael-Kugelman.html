  <p>India and Pakistan have long-standing issues between them, but according to Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Program at the Wilson Center, India's major concern is not Pakistan, but rather China.</p>
  
  <p>When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the United States in June 2016, he addressed a joint session of the US Congress. During his speech, he said, "In our path of sustained growth and poverty alleviation, our biggest partner and collaborator is the United States". This statement reflected India's desire to strengthen its ties with the US and balance the influence of China in the region.</p>
  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p>India's concerns about China can be seen in a number of ways:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The two countries have a long-standing border dispute in the Himalayas, which has led to a number of military clashes over the years.</li>
   <li>China has been building infrastructure in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, which India sees as a direct threat to its territorial integrity.</li>
   <li>China has been expanding its presence in the Indian Ocean, which India sees as an attempt to encircle it and limit its strategic influence in the region.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>One recent example of India's concern about China's influence in the region is its response to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which is China's plan to build infrastructure and promote economic development across Asia, Europe, and Africa. India has refused to join the initiative, citing concerns about China's strategic intentions and the impact on its own economic interests.</p>
  <p>In another case, India has been working to strengthen its defense ties with the US, Japan, and Australia through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, also known as the Quad. This group is seen as a counter to China's rising influence in the region, particularly in the South China Sea.</p>
