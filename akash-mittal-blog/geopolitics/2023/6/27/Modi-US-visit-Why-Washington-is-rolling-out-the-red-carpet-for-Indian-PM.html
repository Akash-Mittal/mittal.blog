    <p>It was a hot summer day in New York City when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived for his first official visit to the United States. As he stepped out of his car, the crowd erupted into cheers, waving Indian flags and chanting his name. It was a moment that would mark the beginning of a new era in US-India relations.</p>
    <p>Modi's visit to the US is significant for two reasons. Firstly, it comes at a time when US-India relations are at an all-time high. Secondly, it marks the first time that President Joe Biden will host a foreign leader at the White House since taking office. Here are some key reasons why Washington is rolling out the red carpet for Modi:</p>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Examples of US-India relations</h2>
    <p>Since taking office in January, President Biden has made clear his intention to strengthen US-India relations. In April, the US president hosted a virtual summit with Modi, where the two leaders pledged to work together on issues such as climate change, defence and security.</p>
    <p>The US has also been a key player in India's fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. In April, the US announced that it would send raw materials to India to help boost the production of the country's COVID vaccines. In addition, the US has sent millions of dollars in aid to India to help the country fight the pandemic.</p>
    <p>Another area where the two countries have been working together is in the field of space exploration. In 2019, India's Chandrayaan-2 mission made headlines when it landed a rover on the moon. The US was one of the countries that congratulated India on the achievement.</p>

    <h2>Case studies of US-India relations</h2>
    <p>One of the most significant developments in US-India relations in recent years has been the signing of the US-India Civil Nuclear Agreement in 2006. The agreement was aimed at allowing India to access nuclear technology and fuel for its civilian nuclear programme, despite not being a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The agreement was seen as a major breakthrough in US-India relations, and paved the way for closer cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear energy.</p>
    <p>Another area where the two countries have been working together is in the field of defence. In 2016, the US designated India as a "Major Defence Partner", which allows for greater cooperation between the two countries in matters such as joint military exercises, defence technology transfers, and defence co-production. This designation was seen as a significant step towards closer defence ties between the US and India.</p>
    <p>Education is another area where the US and India have been working together. The two countries have set a goal of increasing the number of Indian students studying in the US to 200,000 by 2022. This goal was announced in 2017, and since then, both countries have taken steps to make it a reality. The US has streamlined its visa application process for Indian students, while India has launched a number of initiatives to encourage more students to study in the US.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion - Three key takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>The US sees India as an important partner in the region, and is keen to strengthen ties with the country in a number of key areas, including defence, energy and education.</li>
     <li>President Biden's decision to host Modi at the White House is a significant gesture, and is a sign of the importance that the US places on its relationship with India.</li>
     <li>The US-India relationship is likely to remain strong in the coming years, as both countries seek to work together on issues such as climate change, security and economic growth.</li>
