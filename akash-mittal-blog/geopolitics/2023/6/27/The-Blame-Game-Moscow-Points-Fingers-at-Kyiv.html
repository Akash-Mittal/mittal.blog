  <p>Once upon a time, there was a country called Ukraine. This country was one of the most promising and developing countries in Europe. However, ever since the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, Ukraine has been stuck in a never-ending conflict with its neighbor Russia.</p>
  <p>Now, in 2021, Moscow is pointing fingers at Kyiv. Russia has accused Ukraine of deploying more troops and military hardware to the conflict zone in Donbas and planning to attack pro-Russian separatists. Meanwhile, Kyiv has denied these accusations and has accused Moscow of escalating tensions in the region.</p>
  <p>The blame game between Russia and Ukraine is not new. Throughout history, these two countries have had a strained relationship. But what is the root cause of this conflict? Let's explore.</p>
  <h2>Example Cases</h2>
  <h3>Case 1: The Annexation of Crimea</h3>
  <p>In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, a peninsula in Ukraine, following a controversial referendum. This move was opposed by Ukraine and was not recognized by the international community. This annexation was a major turning point in the relationship between Russia and Ukraine, and the root cause of the ongoing conflict.</p>
  <h3>Case 2: The Conflict in Donbas</h3>
  <p>The conflict in Donbas, a region in eastern Ukraine, began in 2014 as a result of the annexation of Crimea. Pro-Russian separatists in the region declared independence and seized control of several cities. This move was again opposed by Ukraine, and a conflict ensued.</p>
  <h3>Case 3: The Gas Dispute</h3>
  <p>In 2019, a gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine arose. The dispute was due to a disagreement over gas transit fees. This dispute resulted in a halt in gas supplies to Ukraine, which in turn caused a shortage of gas in Europe.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The blame game between Russia and Ukraine is ongoing. The conflict has several root causes, including the annexation of Crimea, the conflict in Donbas, and the gas dispute. The situation is complex and has far-reaching effects not only on Ukraine and Russia but also on Europe and the world.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, the relationship between Russia and Ukraine is complicated and strained. Nevertheless, it is essential to find a solution to this conflict to restore peace and stability in the region.</p>
