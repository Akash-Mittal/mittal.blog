   <p>When Maria started her e-commerce business three years ago, she decided to source her products from China due to its low manufacturing costs. However, since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Maria has been struggling with delayed shipments and rising tariffs, which have significantly affected her profit margins. Frustrated with her experience with China, Maria decided to explore other options and came across Mexico as a potential sourcing destination.</p>
   <h2>Examples</h2>
   <p>Mexico is becoming an attractive option for businesses like Maria's due to its close proximity to the United States, highly skilled workforce, and favorable trade agreements. In fact, Mexico is the United States' second-largest trading partner after China, with total trade between the two countries reaching $614.5 billion in 2020.</p>
   <p>For businesses that want to reduce their reliance on China, Mexico offers a variety of advantages. For example, according to a recent report by HSBC, Mexico has a more diversified manufacturing base than China, with strengths in industries such as automotive, electronics, and medical devices. Additionally, Mexico's labor costs are competitive with those of China, and the country's government is actively promoting foreign investment through various incentive programs.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <p>One company that has successfully shifted its sourcing from China to Mexico is Xochitl, a Texas-based manufacturer of tortilla chips and other snack foods. Xochitl's CEO, Tim Merrick, says that his company has been able to reduce its lead times and shipping costs by sourcing its raw materials and packaging from Mexico. He also notes that his Mexican suppliers are more responsive and easier to work with than his Chinese ones, which has led to greater overall efficiency and lower stress for his team.</p>
   <p>Another company that has seen success in Mexico is Bombardier, a Canadian manufacturer of aerospace and transportation equipment. Bombardier has two facilities in Mexico that employ over 4,000 people and produce components for the company's global supply chain. According to Bombardier's President and CEO, Alain Bellemare, Mexico's skilled workforce and free trade agreements with Canada and the United States make it an ideal location for the company to do business.</p>
