  <p></p>
  <p>So what exactly is 'Plan-B' and why was it necessary for Pakistan to activate it? In simple terms, 'Plan-B' refers to a backup strategy or contingency plan that comes into action when the main plan or strategy fails. In Pakistan's case, the main plan was to secure a bailout package from the IMF to stabilize the country's economy. However, due to disagreements over reforms and policies, talks had hit a roadblock. Therefore, activating 'Plan-B' became necessary to mitigate the economic crisis.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Pakistan's 'Plan-B' involved seeking financial assistance from other international sources such as China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). These countries, along with Malaysia, had expressed their willingness to help Pakistan's economy in the past. The objective was to avoid becoming too dependent on the IMF and to diversify funding sources.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One example of how 'Plan-B' worked involved China. In October 2018, Pakistan and China signed several agreements worth billions of dollars. These included investments in Pakistan's energy and infrastructure sectors, which would help boost the country's economy. Furthermore, Pakistan's Foreign Minister stated that the country was seeking a bailout package from China, which would provide relief to the government in case talks with the IMF failed.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another case study regarding 'Plan-B' was the UAE. In December 2018, the UAE announced that it would deposit $3 billion in the State Bank of Pakistan to help boost the country's dwindling foreign exchange reserves. This was a much-needed injection of funding as Pakistan had already received a $6 billion loan from Saudi Arabia earlier that year. The UAE's move was seen as a sign of strong economic ties between the two countries.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, Pakistan's activation of 'Plan-B' was a move that helped the country navigate a difficult economic situation. The strategy of diversifying funding sources proved to be successful as financial assistance from China and the UAE played a vital role in stabilizing the country's economy. In summary, 'Plan-B' worked for Pakistan because:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. It allowed Pakistan to avoid being too dependent on the IMF.</p>
  <p>2. Diversifying funding sources through international partnerships was effective.</p>
  <p>3. 'Plan-B' was able to mitigate the economic crisis Pakistan was facing.</p>
