  <p>There was a time when India was known for its non-aligned foreign policy. The country used to stay away from big power confrontations and focused on developing itself. However, in recent years, we have seen a significant shift in India's foreign policy, especially with regards to China and the United States.</p>
  <p>India is currently going through an anti-China sentiment ever since the border clashes in eastern Ladakh which resulted in the death of multiple Indian soldiers. As a result, the Indian government is seeking closer ties with the United States to counter China's growing influence in the region.</p>
  <p>However, China's Military thinks that it is not in the best interest of the United States to embroil India in a major-country confrontation. Let's dive into why they believe so.</p>
  <h2>No-win Situation for the US</h2>
  <p>According to China's Military, if the US embroils India in a major-country confrontation with China, it would be a no-win situation for the US. It may give India a newfound sense of importance on the global stage, but it would create numerous problems for the US.</p>
  <p>For starters, the US would end up pushing India even closer to China. It's a known fact that India has always been hesitant in fully aligning themselves with the US and prefers to have a more balanced foreign policy. However, if the US forces India into a confrontational role, it would be a serious blow to India's strategic autonomy.</p>
  <p>Moreover, India doesn't have the military or economic strength to withstand a full-scale confrontation with China. While India has made significant investments in modernizing its military in recent years, China still has a massive advantage in terms of budget and technological advancements. Therefore, it would only be counterproductive for the US to involve India in a major-country confrontation.</p>
  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p>This is not the first time that the US has tried to promote a closer relationship with India to contain China. In 2017, the US unveiled its new strategy for the Indo-Pacific region, which aims to counter China's rise. The strategy promotes a closer partnership with India and other countries in the region to balance China's growing influence.</p>
  <p>However, this strategy has not been very successful. India still maintains friendly ties with China and is not fully on board with the US. For example, India did not sign up for an anti-China statement issued by the ASEAN defense ministers in 2019. Additionally, India declined to join the US-led Quad, which aims to contain China's influence in the region.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>If we look at other countries that have aligned themselves with the US to contain China, we can see that it has not been very successful. For example, the Philippines has been a longtime ally of the US, but it has not been able to withstand China's growing influence in the South China Sea. China has turned islands claimed by the Philippines into military bases, ignoring international law and the Philippines' territorial rights.</p>
  <p>Similarly, in 2017, South Korea agreed to install the THAAD missile defense system supplied by the US to deter North Korea. However, this move did not sit well with China, and they imposed economic sanctions on South Korea. This resulted in a significant hit to the South Korean economy, and the country had to rethink its stance on the issue.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Based on the above examples and arguments, it is evident that for the United States, involving India in a major-country confrontation with China would not be a wise decision. Instead, the US should focus on promoting a balanced and peaceful foreign policy in the region to avoid any further geopolitical tensions. The US should also try to build stronger relationships with its traditional allies in the region, such as Japan and South Korea, to counter China's growing influence.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The US would end up pushing India even closer to China</li>
   <li>India doesn't have the military or economic strength to withstand a full-scale confrontation with China</li>
   <li>The US should focus on promoting a balanced and peaceful foreign policy in the region</li>
  </ul>
