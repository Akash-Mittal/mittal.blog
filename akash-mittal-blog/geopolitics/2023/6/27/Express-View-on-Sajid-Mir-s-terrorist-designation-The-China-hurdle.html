   <p>It was a sunny day in Mumbai and people were going about their daily lives until terror struck. On November 26, 2008, a group of militants attacked various targets in the city, including the iconic Taj Mahal Palace and Tower. It was later found that the attacks were orchestrated by the Pakistan-based terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), with Sajid Mir being one of the key planners.</p>
   <p>Sajid Mir, who is believed to be in his mid-forties, is a skilled hacker and the main conspirator behind the Mumbai attacks. He is also involved in other heinous acts of terrorism, including the 2013 Westgate mall attack in Kenya. Despite his notorious track record, China has continued to shield him from being designated as a global terrorist in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC).</p>
   <p>The reason for China's opposition to his terrorist designation lies in its close ties with Pakistan. Pakistan is one of China's closest allies and the two countries share a strong strategic partnership that includes investments in China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project. China has also provided Pakistan with various military and economic aids.</p>
   <h2>Examples</h2>
   <p>China has repeatedly blocked attempts to list Sajid Mir as a designated terrorist in the UNSC. In March 2021, the US, UK, France, and India launched a fresh bid to designate Sajid Mir and others as global terrorists, but China once again used its veto power to block the move. With China's veto, the listing of Sajid Mir remains a challenge, and this has provided a shield for his nefarious activities.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <h3>Case Study 1: The Mumbai Attacks</h3>
   <p>The Mumbai attacks of 2008 had a profound impact on India and the world. The terrorists attacked some of the most iconic landmarks in the city, including the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower, the Oberoi Trident, the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station, Leopold Cafe, and Nariman House. The attacks left 166 people dead and more than 300 others injured. Sajid Mir played a key role in planning and executing the attacks.</p>
   <h3>Case Study 2: The Westgate Mall Attack</h3>
   <p>In 2013, terrorists attacked the Westgate mall in Nairobi, Kenya, killing at least 67 people and injuring hundreds more. The attack was carried out by al-Shabaab militants, with Sajid Mir being the alleged mastermind behind the scenes. As per reports, Sajid Mir coordinated the attack from Pakistan and provided logistical and financial support. The attack was one of the worst in Kenya's history.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>China's close ties with Pakistan have complicated the issue of Sajid Mir's terrorist designation.</li>
    <li>China's veto power in the UNSC has shielded Sajid Mir from being designated as a global terrorist.</li>
    <li>The international community needs to take concrete steps to counter China's support to terrorism and ensure that perpetrators like Sajid Mir are brought to justice.</li>
