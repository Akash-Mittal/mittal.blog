  <h1>Acts Matter in China-U.S. Ties</h1></br> <img src="images/Acts-Matter-in-China-U-S-Ties.jpeg" alt="+Acts-Matter-in-China-U-S-Ties+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="http://eng.chinamil.com.cn/OPINIONS_209196/Opinions_209197/16231418.html" target="_blank" href="http://eng.chinamil.com.cn/OPINIONS_209196/Opinions_209197/16231418.html" rel="noopener">http://eng.chinamil.com.cn/OPINIONS_209196/Opinions_209197/16231418.html</a></span></h5>
  
  <p>In 1972, China and the United States established diplomatic relations. Since then, the two countries have cooperated and competed on a range of economic, political, and military issues. However, in recent years, the relationship has become increasingly complex and fraught with tension.</p>
  <p>China's rise as a global power, its assertiveness in the South China Sea, its human rights record, and its trade practices have all been sources of contention between the two nations. The Trump administration's trade war and strategic competition rhetoric have only escalated the conflict.</p>
  <p>In this context, it is essential to understand that actions speak louder than words in China-U.S. ties. Rhetoric and promises are not enough to build trust and cooperation. Concrete actions are necessary to demonstrate intent and sincerity.</p>
  <h2>Examples of China's Military Progress</h2>
  <p>One area where China has made significant progress in recent years is its military capabilities. The Chinese government has invested heavily in defense technology, modernization, and expansion. Some notable examples include:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The construction of artificial islands in the South China Sea, which can serve as military bases and strategic outposts.</li>
   <li>The deployment of advanced missile systems, such as the DF-26 and DF-21D, which can target U.S. ships and bases in the region.</li>
   <li>The development of stealth fighters, such as the J-20 and J-31, which could challenge U.S. air superiority in the Western Pacific.</li>
   <li>The establishment of a military base in Djibouti, which marks China's first overseas military installation.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All these actions demonstrate China's determination to project power and defend its interests, both regionally and globally.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>The importance of actions is particularly evident in some recent cases that have strained China-U.S. ties:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The COVID-19 pandemic: The initial response of the Chinese government to the outbreak was criticized for lack of transparency and accountability. Its efforts to control the narrative and deflect blame also fueled suspicion and resentment in the international community. China's donation of medical supplies and vaccines, while helpful, did not erase the perception that it mishandled the crisis and caused global harm.</li>
   <li>The Hong Kong protests: The increasingly authoritarian measures of the Chinese government in Hong Kong, such as the national security law and the crackdown on dissent, have sparked widespread condemnation and protests. The U.S. government has responded with sanctions, visa restrictions, and extradition treaties suspensions. China's move to disqualify elected legislators and suppress the opposition further alienated the international community and eroded trust in its commitments.</li>
   <li>The U.S.-China trade war: The tit-for-tat tariffs and trade restrictions imposed by both sides have harmed businesses and consumers in both countries. The Trump administration's unilateral and unpredictable approach to trade policy has damaged the credibility of the U.S. as a reliable partner and undermined the stability of the global economy. China's retaliatory measures and lack of concessions have also raised concerns about its compliance with international trade rules and standards.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In all these cases, actions taken by both countries had a significant impact on the bilateral relationship and the world order. Words alone could not change the dynamics or resolve the disputes.</p>
  <h2></h2>
  <ol>
   <li>Actions matter more than words in China-U.S. ties. Both countries need to show concrete and consistent actions that align with their commitments and principles.</li>
   <li>Military progress is a crucial aspect of China's rise as a global power. The U.S. needs to balance its competition with China with strategic cooperation and arms control dialogues.</li>
   <li>Recent cases illustrate the tensions and challenges in China-U.S. relations. Both countries need to address their differences and find ways to cooperate on common interests, such as climate change, public health, and global governance.</li>
