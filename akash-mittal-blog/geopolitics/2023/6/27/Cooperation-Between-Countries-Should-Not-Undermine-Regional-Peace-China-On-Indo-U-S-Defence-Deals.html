  <p>In September 2021, the United States and India signed a major defence pact, called the AUKUS (Australia, UK, US) alliance, which aims to counter the growing influence of China in the Indo-Pacific region. This pact involves the sharing of defence technology, including nuclear-powered submarines, between these three countries. While India has welcomed the pact as a boost to its defence capabilities, China has criticized it as a threat to regional peace. In this article, we explore China's stance on Indo-US defence deals and the importance of cooperation between countries without undermining regional peace.</p>
  <p>China's objections to the Indo-US defence deals are not limited to the AUKUS alliance. In recent years, India and the US have signed several defence agreements, including the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA), the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA), and the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA). These agreements allow for the sharing of military logistics, communication technology and geospatial information, respectively. China sees these agreements as an attempt to encircle it militarily and undermine its security interests in the region.</p>
  <p>However, China's aggression towards its neighbours, including India, Taiwan, and the South China Sea, has also contributed to the growing tensions in the region. In recent years, China has engaged in territorial disputes with India along the border in the Ladakh region, leading to a violent clash in June 2020. China has also increased its military presence in the South China Sea, which has led to tensions with several Southeast Asian countries including the Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia. China has also aggressively pursued its claims over Taiwan, a democratic island that China considers a breakaway province.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>China's territorial disputes with its neighbours have undermined regional peace and security, leading to an arms race in the region. India has increased its defence spending and modernized its military to counter the Chinese threat. Several Southeast Asian countries have also sought closer ties with the US and Japan to deter Chinese aggression.</li>
   <li>The Indo-US defence deals are aimed at strengthening the security cooperation between these two democracies, without explicitly targeting China. The US has stated that its strategy in the Indo-Pacific region is based on a "free and open" Indo-Pacific, which includes promoting economic development, respecting the rule of law, and upholding the territorial integrity of nations. India also sees the US as a partner in its quest for security and economic development.</li>
   <li>Cooperation between countries should not undermine regional peace and security. Countries must work towards resolving their disputes through peaceful means and respecting each other's sovereignty. The US and India should engage in dialogue with China to address their concerns and find ways to cooperate in areas of mutual interest, such as trade and climate change.</li>
  </ul>

   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <p>Let's take a look at some case studies to understand the impact of the Indo-US defence deals on regional peace and security.</p>
   <h3>India-China Border Dispute</h3><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wtGtcaWcsP0" title="India-China Border Dispute"></iframe>
   <p>The border dispute between India and China is a longstanding issue that has resulted in several military conflicts over the years. The recent clash in June 2020, in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed, has led to a significant escalation of tensions between these two nuclear-armed nations. India's defence deals with the US, including the sale of advanced weapons systems like drones, helicopters and fighter jets, have provided it with the necessary military capabilities to deter Chinese aggression along the border. However, China sees these deals as an attempt to contain it and undermine its security interests in the region.</p>
   <h3>South China Sea Tensions</h3><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fjmZxqU7eQk" title="South China Sea Tensions"></iframe>
   <p>The South China Sea is a hotly contested region where several Southeast Asian countries, including the Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia, have overlapping territorial claims with China. China has aggressively pursued its claims over the region, constructing artificial islands and militarizing them with missiles and other weapons systems. The US has conducted freedom of navigation operations to challenge China's claims and support its allies in the region. The Indo-US defence deals are expected to strengthen the US military presence in the region and deter Chinese aggression.</p>

   <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, cooperation between countries should not undermine regional peace and security. While the Indo-US defence deals are aimed at strengthening the security cooperation between these two democracies, they should not be seen as a direct threat to China. China's territorial disputes with its neighbours have led to growing tensions in the region, and it must engage in dialogue with its neighbours to address their concerns and find ways to cooperate in areas of mutual interest. Countries must work towards resolving their disputes through peaceful means and respecting each other's sovereignty.</p>
