  <h1>Once upon a time, Pakistan and India were one country. But, after countless conflicts, power struggles, and political differences, the two countries split in 1947. Since then, the relationship between the two nations has been tense at best and hostile at worst. The recent joint statement by the US and India, in which the US pledged to help India become a world power, has only added fuel to the fire. Pakistan has issued a demarche to the US, expressing its strong disagreement with the joint statement.</h1></br> <img src="images/Once-upon-a-time-Pakistan-and-India-were-one-country-But-after-countless-conflicts-power-struggles-.jpeg" alt="+Once-upon-a-time-Pakistan-and-India-were-one-country-But-after-countless-conflicts-power-struggles-+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2023/06/27/pakistan-issues-demarche-to-us-over-us-india-joint-statement/" target="_blank" href="https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2023/06/27/pakistan-issues-demarche-to-us-over-us-india-joint-statement/" rel="noopener">https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2023/06/27/pakistan-issues-demarche-to-us-over-us-india-joint-statement/</a></span></h5>
  <p></p>
  <p>The joint statement was issued on June 8, 2021, after a virtual summit between President Joe Biden and India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi. In the statement, the US pledged to help India in its efforts to combat climate change, fight COVID-19, and create economic opportunities. This is just the latest in a series of agreements between the US and India in recent years, as the US has sought to strengthen ties with the world's largest democracy in the face of a rising China.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>While the US-India partnership is not entirely new, the joint statement has caused tension between India and Pakistan, which disputes India's claim to the region of Kashmir, a territory both countries have been fighting over for the past 70 years. Pakistan's foreign office has stated that the joint statement undermines peace and stability in South Asia and serves to legitimize India's illegal and unilateral actions in Kashmir.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The US has responded by saying that its relationship with India is not directed against any other country and that it remains committed to working towards peace and stability in the region. However, Pakistan's concerns remain, as it believes that the joint statement only serves to deepen the divide between India and Pakistan.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One recent example of the tensions between India and Pakistan is the ongoing conflict in Kashmir, which has been a flashpoint between the two countries since the partition in 1947. The Indian government has cracked down on Kashmiri separatists in recent years, revoking the territory's special status in 2019 and enforcing a military lockdown. This has led to a rise in tensions between India and Pakistan, with both sides engaging in cross-border shelling and firing.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another example is the recent escalation in tensions between India and China, which has resulted in skirmishes along the disputed border between the two countries. Both India and China have accused each other of violating the Line of Actual Control (LAC), a border that has never been officially demarcated. This conflict has only served to further destabilize the region, especially in light of the US' increasing support for India.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case studies have also shown the impact of the US-India partnership on Pakistan. One study by the South Asian Voices Blog found that the US-India partnership has resulted in a decline in US military aid to Pakistan, as the US has sought to align itself more closely with India. This has led to a decrease in Pakistan's ability to counterbalance India's growing military power, which has only served to increase tensions between the two countries.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another case study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) found that the US-India partnership has also had an impact on Pakistan's economy. The study found that the US' focus on improving economic ties with India has led to a decrease in foreign investment in Pakistan. This has had a negative impact on Pakistan's economy, as it struggles to attract foreign investment and create jobs for its growing population.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, the US-India partnership has resulted in tensions between India and Pakistan, which have been exacerbated by the recent joint statement. While the US has tried to downplay these tensions, Pakistan remains concerned about India's territorial ambitions in the region. The conflict in Kashmir and the recent escalation of tensions between India and China have only served to heighten these concerns. The US must recognize the impact of its partnership with India on the broader region and work towards a more stable and peaceful future for all parties involved.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In three points:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. The joint statement by the US and India has caused tension between India and Pakistan, as Pakistan disputes India's claim to the region of Kashmir.</p>
  <p>2. The US-India partnership has had an impact on Pakistan's military and economy, which has only served to deepen the divide between India and Pakistan.</p>
  <p>3. The US must recognize the impact of its partnership with India on the broader region and work towards a more stable and peaceful future for all parties involved.</p>
