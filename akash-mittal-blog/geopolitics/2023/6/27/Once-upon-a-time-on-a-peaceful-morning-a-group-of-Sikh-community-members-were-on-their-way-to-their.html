  <p></p>
  <p>The recent attack on the Sikh community members in Pakistan has once again sparked outrage globally, and India has taken notice of this matter. The Indian government has summoned a senior Pakistani diplomat over the attacks on the Sikh community members. This act of violence against the minority communities of Pakistan has been a consistent issue that India has been raising concerns about for many years.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This is not the first time that such incidents of violence and intolerance against minority communities have occurred in Pakistan. The minorities in the country have been facing challenges and discrimination for many years, and it is high time that this issue gets addressed.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One example of the discrimination faced by minorities in Pakistan is the infamous blasphemy law, which puts the lives of the minority communities at risk. According to this law, anyone found guilty of insulting Islam can be sentenced to death. It has been misused in the past to target minority communities, leading to mob attacks and killings.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another example of intolerance towards minority communities is the forced conversions of young girls from minority religions to Islam. These girls are kidnapped and forcibly converted to Islam, which is an egregious violation of their fundamental rights.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Such incidents of discrimination and violence have compelled several countries, including India, to raise concerns about the human rights situation in Pakistan. It is high time that Pakistan takes appropriate measures to protect minority communities and ensure their safety and rights.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case studies of incidents of violence against minority communities in Pakistan can be found in abundance. For instance, in 2019, a Hindu temple was vandalized, and the idols were destroyed in the Sindh province of Pakistan. Similarly, in 2020, a mob attacked a cathedral in Pakistan's Sialkot city, damaging the building and the symbols of Christianity.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>These incidents of violence and discrimination against minority communities in Pakistan not only violate the principles of human rights but also disrupt the peace and harmony of the country. Pakistan needs to work towards creating a society that is tolerant and inclusive of all its citizens, regardless of their religion and ethnicity.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, the attack on the Sikh community members in Pakistan has once again brought the issue of violence and intolerance towards minority communities to the forefront. The Indian government's summoning of a senior Pakistani diplomat over this matter sends a message that such incidents of violence will not be tolerated. Pakistan needs to take necessary measures to protect the rights of its minority communities and work towards creating a society that is inclusive and tolerant.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The three important points to be noted here are:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. The continuous intolerance and violence towards minority communities in Pakistan are a violation of human rights and disrupt the peace of the country.</p>
  <p>2. The blasphemy law in Pakistan is often used to target minority communities, leading to mob attacks and killings.</p>
  <p>3. Pakistan needs to take appropriate measures to protect the rights of its minority communities and work towards creating a society that is inclusive and tolerant.</p>
