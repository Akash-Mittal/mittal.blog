     <h2>Interesting Story</h2>
     <p>In 2014, Ukraine witnessed a popular uprising known as the Euromaidan, which led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, who had been in power since 1994, watched the events in Ukraine with fear and anxiety. He saw the foreign involvement and internal fragmentation of Ukraine and understood the dangers. The lesson he learned for his own regime was that he needed to pursue geo-strategic interests rather than direct democracy promotion.</p>

    <section id="examples">
     <h2>Examples</h2>
     <p>The example of Lukashenko's policy shift can be seen in his handling of the Russian aggression against Ukraine in 2014. Despite being a staunch ally of Russia, Lukashenko refused to back Moscow's annexation of Crimea and the war in eastern Ukraine. Instead, he played a mediator role between Russia and Ukraine, hosting peace talks and engaging with the West. This approach helped Lukashenko maintain his independence and stability within Belarus while also securing Russia's support for his regime.</p>
     <p>Another example of geo-strategic interests over democracy promotion can be seen in the Chinese government's approach to Belarus. China has invested heavily in Belarus, providing loans and infrastructure projects in exchange for political and economic cooperation. The Chinese government has not pressured Belarus to democratize or improve its human rights record, instead focusing on securing access to Belarusian resources and market potential.</p>

     <h2>Case Studies</h2>
     <h3>Case Study 1: Russia-Belarus Relations</h3>
     <p>Belarus is often referred to as Russia's "closest ally." However, despite their close relationship, Lukashenko has played a delicate balancing act in his dealings with Moscow. He has sought to maintain his country's independence while also securing Moscow's economic and political support. In 2019, Lukashenko refused to merge with Russia even as Moscow pushed for closer integration. This move allowed Belarus to maintain its sovereignty while also ensuring support from Russia.</p>
     <h3>Case Study 2: China-Belarus Relations</h3>
     <p>China has invested heavily in Belarus, with over $15 billion in loans and infrastructure projects. In exchange, China has secured access to Belarusian markets and resources. Lukashenko has welcomed Chinese investment, seeing it as an opportunity to diversify his country's economic relations. However, the Chinese government has not pressured Lukashenko to improve his human rights record or democratize his government.</p>
