  <h1>An unexpected bond: A story of Sikhs and Muslims</h1></br> <img src="images/India-s-protest-against-attacks-on-Sikhs-by-Pakistan.jpeg" alt="+India-s-protest-against-attacks-on-Sikhs-by-Pakistan+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-summons-pakistani-diplomat-lodges-protest-against-attacks-on-sikhs-1231509.html" target="_blank" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-summons-pakistani-diplomat-lodges-protest-against-attacks-on-sikhs-1231509.html" rel="noopener">https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-summons-pakistani-diplomat-lodges-protest-against-attacks-on-sikhs-1231509.html</a></span></h5>
  <p>Amidst the tension between the two neighboring countries, India and Pakistan, there was an unexpected bond growing between two religious communities; Sikhs and Muslims. In the year 2018, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan proposed the idea of opening the Kartarpur Corridor, a border crossing point between the two countries. This initiative was welcomed by Sikhs worldwide as it allowed them easy access to their holy shrine, Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, located in Kartarpur. Since then, the relationships between Sikhs and Pakistan have been put under the microscope as several attacks on Sikhs have been reported in Pakistan.</p>
  <h2>The Attacks on Sikhs in Pakistan</h2>
  <p>Sikhs, the followers of Sikhism, are a minority community in Pakistan and have faced discrimination in different forms. However, the situation got worse when several violent incidents took place against Sikhs in Pakistan. In July 2020, a Sikh religious leader was shot dead in Peshawar, and in the same month, an 18-year-old Sikh girl was allegedly abducted and forcibly converted to Islam. Such incidents have infuriated Sikhs all over the world, and as a result, the Indian government summoned a Pakistani diplomat in Delhi on 5th November 2020 to lodge a protest against the attacks on Sikhs.</p>
  <h3>Case Study on Abduction and Forced Conversion of Sikh Girls</h3>
  <p>One of the major challenges faced by the Sikh community in Pakistan is the abduction and forcible conversion of Sikh girls to Islam. The case of Jagjit Kaur from Nankana Sahib, Pakistan, who was allegedly kidnapped and converted to Islam, is still a prominent example of the violence faced by Sikhs in Pakistan. The incident sparked massive protests by the Sikhs in India and worldwide, resulting in a diplomatic tussle between the two countries.</p>
  <h3>Case Study on Attack on Gurdwara Nankana Sahib in Pakistan</h3>
  <p>In January 2020, an angry mob attacked Gurdwara Nankana Sahib in Pakistan, which is considered one of the holiest shrines of the Sikh community. The mob pelted stones at the gurdwara and also used derogatory language against Sikhs, resulting in considerable damage to the shrine. The attack was condemned worldwide, and the Indian government took a stern view of the matter, warning Pakistan of dire consequences if such incidents continue.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The attacks on Sikhs in Pakistan have not only put the relationship between the two neighboring countries under the microscope, but it has also brought to light the challenges faced by minority communities in Pakistan. The cases of abduction and forcible conversion of Sikh girls, as well as the attacks on Sikh shrines, are a painful reminder of the discrimination faced by minorities in the country. It is imperative for the Pakistani government to take necessary measures to safeguard the rights of minority communities and ensure their safety and security. India, on its part, must use all available diplomatic channels to bring such incidents to the attention of the international community and hold Pakistan accountable for its actions.</p>
