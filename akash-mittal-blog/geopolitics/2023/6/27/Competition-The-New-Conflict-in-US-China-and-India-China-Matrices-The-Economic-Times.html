   <p>There was a time when the US and China's relationship was seen as a symbol of two nations bridging the divide between the East and West. India, too, hoped to strengthen ties with China. But things have changed in recent times. Politically, the US-China trade war has dominated news headlines. Economically, the rise of China as a global financial powerhouse has spurred fierce competition.</p>
   <p>Perhaps it's time to recognise that competition is the new conflict between these nations. Let's explore the US-China and India-China matrices more closely and understand the fierce competition taking place.</p>
   <h2>US-China Matrix</h2>
   <p>The US-China matrix is one of the most discussed relationships in recent times. It's no secret that the two countries have been embroiled in a bitter trade war with each other since 2018. The US has accused China of engaging in unfair trade practices, intellectual property theft, and lying about the handling of COVID-19. On the other hand, China has accused the US of trying to contain its rise and interfering in its internal affairs.</p>
   <p>It's not just a trade war that has broken out between the two nations. The two powers are also locked in a technological race to achieve supremacy. The race between China's Huawei and America's Qualcomm to develop 5G technology is a case in point. The US is doing everything it can to slow down China's tech juggernaut, whereas China is racing ahead with its ambitious Made in China 2025 programme.</p>
   <h2>India-China Matrix</h2>
   <p>The India-China matrix may not be as high-profile as that of the US and China, but the competition between the two Asian giants is no less fierce. India and China have had a longstanding territorial dispute, with both sides claiming parts of Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh. This dispute boiled over in June 2020 when 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a clash with Chinese soldiers at the border in the Galwan Valley.</p>
   <p>Economic competition between India and China is also heating up. India has banned Chinese apps like TikTok and PUBG, which were immensely popular in India. India has also been offering incentives to US companies looking to move manufacturing operations out of China. Meanwhile, China has been investing heavily in India's neighbouring countries, such as Pakistan and Sri Lanka, creating a strategic arc around India.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <p>Let's take a look at some case studies that demonstrate the competitive environment between these nations:</p>
   <h3>Case Study 1: TikTok</h3>
   <p>TikTok was a wildly popular app in India, with over 200 million users. However, in June 2020, India banned TikTok along with 58 other Chinese apps. This was a direct consequence of the border clash between India and China. The ban dealt a severe blow to TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, which reportedly lost billions of dollars in revenue. This move was seen as India's way of showing China that it would not be pushed around.</p>
   <h3>Case Study 2: Huawei</h3>
   <p>Huawei has been at the centre of the US-China tech race. The Chinese tech giant has been accused of being a security risk, with the US alleging that Huawei's equipment could be used to spy on countries. As a result, the US government has banned Huawei from participating in its 5G rollout and has pressured its allies to do the same. The US has also placed heavy sanctions on Huawei, which have severely affected its business. This case study demonstrates how the US is willing to go to great lengths to stop China from achieving technological supremacy.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, competition is the new conflict in the US-China and India-China matrices. The trade war, territorial disputes, and technology race demonstrate the fierce competition between these nations. It's imperative to recognise this reality and work towards finding ways to move forward. The following are three key takeaways from this article:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Competition between nations is a natural consequence of their growing economic and political power.</li>
    <li>Competition does not necessarily mean conflict. It is possible for nations to compete and coexist peacefully.</li>
    <li>It's necessary to recognise the competitive environment and seek ways to cooperate without compromising national interests.</li>
   </ul>
