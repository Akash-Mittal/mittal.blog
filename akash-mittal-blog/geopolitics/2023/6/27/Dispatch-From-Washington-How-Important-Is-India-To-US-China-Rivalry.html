  <main><!-- Starting with an Interesting Story -->
   <p>It was a hot summer day in June 2017 when the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, met with President Donald Trump at the White House. The two leaders exchanged pleasantries, posed for pictures, and discussed the future of the US-India relationship. But one sentence from President Trump caught everyone off guard. He said, "We appreciate India's important contributions to stability in Afghanistan."</p>
   <p>For years, India had been wary of US-Pakistan ties, especially when it came to Afghanistan. Pakistan had been accused of supporting the Taliban against US forces in Afghanistan. India, on the other hand, had been investing heavily in the development of the war-torn country. President Trump's statement signaled a change in the US stance towards India and Pakistan. It also highlighted India's growing importance in the US-China rivalry.</p><!-- Examples -->
   <h2>Examples of India's Growing Importance in US-China Rivalry</h2>
   <p>India's strategic location, large market, and military capabilities make it an important player in the US-China rivalry. Here are some examples:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Quad alliance:</strong> The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, also known as the Quad, is a strategic grouping of the US, India, Japan, and Australia. It was formed in 2007 but fell apart due to China's objections. In 2017, it was re-established as a response to China's assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region. The Quad is seen as a counter to China's growing influence in the region.</li>
    <li><strong>BRI alternative:</strong> The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is China's ambitious plan to build infrastructure projects across Asia, Europe, and Africa. It is seen as a way for China to expand its economic and political influence globally. In response, India, Japan, and the US have launched the Blue Dot Network, which aims to promote high-quality infrastructure projects that are transparent, environmentally sustainable, and financially viable.</li>
    <li><strong>Border dispute:</strong> India and China have a longstanding border dispute that has resulted in a military standoff in recent years. The US has offered its support to India in the dispute and has condemned China's aggression. The US also signed the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) with India, which allows for the sharing of military intelligence.</li>
   </ul><!-- Case Studies -->
   <h2>Case Studies of India's Importance in US-China Rivalry</h2>
   <p>Here are some case studies that illustrate India's importance in the US-China rivalry:</p>
   <h3>Case Study 1: Huawei Ban</h3>
   <p>In 2019, the US government banned Chinese technology company Huawei from doing business with US companies. The ban was a result of concerns that Huawei's products could be used for espionage by the Chinese government. However, the ban had unintended consequences for American companies that relied on Huawei's products, especially in the telecommunications industry. The ban also created an opportunity for Indian companies, such as Jio, to step in and fill the gap.</p>
   <h3>Case Study 2: Taiwan Relations Act</h3>
   <p>The US has maintained unofficial relations with Taiwan since 1979, when it switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China. However, the Taiwan Relations Act allows the US to provide Taiwan with defensive weapons to protect against a possible Chinese invasion. In 2020, the US approved the sale of $1.8 billion worth of weapons to Taiwan, angering China. India has been watching the situation closely, as it fears that China may apply the same tactics it used in the South China Sea to the Indian Ocean.</p><!--  -->
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>India's growing importance in the US-China rivalry is due to its strategic location, market, and military capabilities. The Quad alliance, the Blue Dot Network, and the border dispute are just a few examples of India's role in countering China's assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region. The Huawei ban and the Taiwan Relations Act are also examples of how India is impacted by the US-China rivalry. In conclusion, India's importance in the US-China rivalry is likely to increase in the coming years.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>India is a key player in the Quad alliance, which is seen as a counter to China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region.</li>
    <li>India is involved in the Blue Dot Network, which aims to counter China's Belt and Road Initiative.</li>
    <li>India's border dispute with China and its proximity to the South China Sea make it a potential flashpoint in the US-China rivalry.</li>
