  <p>Once upon a time, two friends - let's call them India and the United States - decided to work together on a big project. They both had complementary skills and resources, and believed that their teamwork would lead to great success. However, they soon realized that their collaboration was offending another friend - China.</p>
  <p>"I am happy that India and the United States are becoming closer, but this cooperation should not be targeted against a third party," commented a Chinese spokesperson. This statement reflects the common sentiment among countries that feel excluded or threatened by exclusive partnerships, especially if they are formed as a part of larger geopolitical strategies.</p>
  <h2>The Appeal and Risks of Exclusive Cooperations</h2>
  <p>Exclusive or selective cooperation refers to situations where two or more countries enter into agreements that are specifically designed to exclude other countries, or to achieve special benefits or strategic objectives. These agreements can take various forms, such as strategic partnerships, military alliances, free trade agreements, technology transfers, diplomatic ties, or joint ventures. The appeal of such agreements is understandable, as they offer the following benefits:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Closer alignment of interests, values, and goals;</li>
   <li>Increase of economic, political, or military leverage;</li>
   <li>Mitigation of risks and uncertainties;</li>
   <li>Opportunities for mutual learning and cooperation;</li>
   <li>Showcase of status, influence, and prestige.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>However, selective cooperation also involves several risks and downsides, mostly relating to the negative externalities that it creates for non-participants:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Exclusion of potential partners, who might feel left out or offended;</li>
   <li>Divisiveness of global or regional efforts, creating rivalries and alliances;</li>
   <li>Distortion of economic and political flows, creating imbalances and inequalities;</li>
   <li>Creation of security dilemmas, increasing tensions and conflicts;</li>
   <li>Undermining of multilateral norms and institutions, weakening global governance.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Examples of Selective Cooperations and their Impacts</h2>
  <p>The world has witnessed various selective cooperations in the past century, which have had mixed effects on global politics, economy, and society. Some examples are:</p>
  <h3>Non-Aligned Movement: Unity or Division?</h3>
  <p>One of the most prominent selective cooperations was the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), started in 1961 by a group of countries that refused to align with either the Soviet Union or the United States during the Cold War. The NAM aimed to promote peace, solidarity, and cooperation among developing countries, and to resist colonialism, imperialism, and hegemony. However, the NAM also suffered from internal divisions, competing interests, and ideological tensions, and failed to achieve many of its goals.</p>
  <h3>Belt and Road Initiative: Integration or Domination?</h3>
  <p>Another example of selective cooperation is the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), launched by China in 2013 to build a network of infrastructure, trade, and financial links between Asia, Europe, and Africa. The BRI aims to boost economic growth, connectivity, and development, but has also raised concerns about debt sustainability, transparency, and geopolitical influence of China. Some countries have welcomed the BRI, while others have criticized it as a new form of colonialism or neocolonialism.</p>
  <h3>Quad: Alliance or Containment?</h3>
  <p>A recent example of selective cooperation is the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), consisting of the United States, Japan, Australia, and India. The Quad aims to strengthen regional security, democracy, and economic development, and to counterbalance the growing influence of China in the Asia-Pacific region. However, the Quad has also been seen as a nascent military alliance against China, and has elicited sharp reactions from China and other regional powers.</p>
  <h2>The Three Principles of Multilateral Cooperation</h2>
  <p>The above examples show that selective cooperation can be both beneficial and risky, depending on the context and implications of each case. Therefore, it is important for countries to follow certain principles when engaging in cooperative activities, in order to avoid negative externalities and promote global harmony. These principles are:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Inclusiveness: All countries should be given the opportunity to participate in cooperative efforts, without discrimination or domination.</li>
   <li>Mutuality: Cooperative efforts should benefit both the participants and the non-participants, through win-win outcomes and sharing of costs and benefits.</li>
   <li>Transparency: Cooperative efforts should be carried out in a transparent and accountable way, with clear objectives, rules, and procedures, and respect for international law and human rights.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion: The Way Forward for Cooperation</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, selective cooperation can be a double-edged sword, offering both opportunities and challenges for countries' strategic and economic interests. As such, countries should adopt a balanced approach to cooperation, based on the three principles of inclusiveness, mutuality, and transparency. By doing so, they can maximize the benefits of cooperation, while minimizing its risks and negative effects on the global community.</p>
