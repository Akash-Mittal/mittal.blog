  <title>Once there was a small village named "Peaceville" where people from different backgrounds lived together in harmony.

However, one day a rumor spread that a neighboring village was planning to attack Peaceville. Suddenly, the villagers got divided into groups based on their religion, caste, and nationality. Each group wanted to protect their own interests, and suspicion and fear replaced trust and friendship.</title>

  <p></p>
  <p>This story may seem like a work of fiction, but it reflects the current state of international relations. In an era of globalization and interdependence, countries are becoming more insular and suspicious of each other. Instead of working together to solve common global problems like poverty, climate change, and terrorism, they are engaged in a zero-sum game of power politics. The recent statement by the US-India alliance is one such example, which has led to the summoning of the US deputy mission chief by Pakistan.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The statement by the US-India alliance that Pakistan must ensure that its territory is not used to launch terrorist attacks echoes India's long-standing stance of blaming Pakistan for cross-border terrorism. However, it ignores the root causes of terrorism, such as poverty, injustice, and discrimination, and relies on military solutions that often escalate the violence. Moreover, it overlooks the fact that Pakistan itself has been a victim of terrorism, with thousands of civilians and security personnel losing their lives in terrorist attacks.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The US-India alliance is also part of a larger geopolitical shift towards containing China, which is seen as a rising superpower challenging the US dominance. While this strategy may benefit the US and India in the short term, it risks creating another cold war scenario and exacerbating the already fragile security environment in South Asia.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The case of Afghanistan is a testimony to the futility of such power politics. The US intervention in Afghanistan in 2001, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, has not only failed to bring peace and stability but has also created new forms of violence and extremism. The Afghan people have borne the brunt of this conflict, with millions being displaced, killed, or injured, and the country being ranked among the poorest and least developed in the world.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In contrast, the recent peace deal between the Taliban and the US, which calls for the withdrawal of US troops and the start of intra-Afghan dialogue, offers a glimmer of hope for a sustainable peace in Afghanistan. This deal was possible only because the parties involved chose to prioritize diplomacy over military coercion, and recognize each other's legitimate concerns and interests.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The lessons from the Afghan conflict and the potential of peace processes highlight the need for a paradigm shift in international relations, based on the principles of mutual respect and cooperation. This shift should address the structural causes of conflict, such as poverty, inequality, discrimination, and environmental degradation, and promote inclusive and sustainable development.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, the recent statement by the US-India alliance and the summoning of the US deputy mission chief by Pakistan are symptoms of a larger malaise in international relations, where power politics and narrow interests prevail over common humanity. However, there is still hope for a better future, where nations can work together to create a world that is peaceful, just, and prosperous. This future requires a new mindset, based on dialogue, understanding, and empathy, and a commitment to the common good over narrow interests.</p>
