  <p>In Kenya, there is a Maasai tribe boy named Lekishon. He is the first person in his family to attend school and is determined to become a doctor so he can help his community. Lekishon's story is an example of the potential within Africa. The continent has been long perceived as a lost cause plagued with war, poverty, and disease. However, this narrative is changing with Africa's recent economic revival that has been drawing the attention of countries such as India.</p>
  <h2>Key Factors Contributing to Africa's Rise</h2>
  <p>India's Foreign Minister, S Jaishankar, highlighted Africa's exciting potential and integral role in geopolitical rebalancing during his address at the Confederation of Indian Industry's (CII) 2021 Annual Session. Jaishankar outlined four factors that are responsible for Africa's rise in the world.</p>
  <ol>
   <li><strong>Demographics:</strong> With the world's youngest population, Africa is expected to have a surplus working-age population than any other continent by 2030. This has led to an enormous amount of human capital that has the potential to realize significant economic potential when accompanied by appropriate education and training.</li>
   <li><strong>Urbanization:</strong> African cities are growing at an unprecedented pace, which means that the continent needs to build more infrastructure, creating opportunities for local and global businesses.</li>
   <li><strong>Technology:</strong> From innovative mobile money platforms such as M-Pesa, to Silicon Savannah receiving significant investment, Africa is a hotbed of digital innovation, providing considerable potential for transforming business models and improving businesses.</li>
   <li><strong>Regional integration:</strong> African countries are coming together in powerful ways, forming the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) that aims to unify 1.3 billion people into a common market. This is the world's largest free-trade area, giving Africa immense leverage in global trade negotiations.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>In 2018, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi committed $10 billion in credit to African countries over five years and offered concessional loans of up to $600 million to Somalia, making India Africa's fourth-largest donor. This shows how India is starting to recognize the significant potential of the continent to enhance its own strategic interests. Following are two case studies to demonstrate how African nations are evolving:</p>
  <h3>Rwanda</h3>
  <p>Rwanda's economy has been growing at around 8% per annum since 2015. The country has a young, skilled population, strong institutions, and an efficient government that is keen on promoting business and investment. In 2017, the country launched Zipline, a drone delivery service that transports essential medicines and blood products to remote locations. This initiative has been incredibly manifest in Rwanda's transformation, and has caught the attention of investors from India, Canada, and the US.</p>
  <h3>Ethiopia</h3>
  <p>Ethiopia has been growing at 8% per annum since 2003. The landlocked country has managed to become one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa by investing massively in infrastructure, manufacturing, and, recently, by opening up its telecoms and airline sectors to competition. In September 2020, Ethiopian Airlines broke ground on a $5 billion hub that will transform Bole International into Africa's largest airport. The airport, once completed, intends to handle 100 million passengers annually.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, Africa's rise is crucial to the geopolitical rebalancing of the world, and India's recognition of this trend is essential. Africa has been edging towards transformation for some time now, which is evident in the lives of ordinary Africans, such as Lekishon. However, it is essential to acknowledge that African states have not yet achieved their full potential.</p>
  <p>With this perspective, African nations must develop programmes designed to maximize their potential and growth, while leveraging their enormous human resources, social and cultural diversity, and institutions. Africa and India have a historic bond, and this strategic energy can help revolutionize and lead the world in economic growth and development.</p>
