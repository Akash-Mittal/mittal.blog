  <h1>An Insight into Biden's Remark on China's Xi: A Decision or a Reckoning?</h1></br> <img src="images/An-Insight-into-Biden-s-Remark-on-China-s-Xi-A-Decision-or-a-Reckoning.jpeg" alt="+An-Insight-into-Biden-s-Remark-on-China-s-Xi-A-Decision-or-a-Reckoning+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/biden-defends-calling-chinas-xi-a-dictator" target="_blank" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/biden-defends-calling-chinas-xi-a-dictator" rel="noopener">https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/biden-defends-calling-chinas-xi-a-dictator</a></span></h5>
  <p>On June 12, 2021, the world saw Joe Biden calling China's leader Xi Jinping a "dictator." The statement came as a backlash from China's stringent treatment of minorities, including Uighur Muslims, Hong Kong residents, etc. It also highlighted Biden's resolve to negotiate with China but only by drawing clear lines around human rights violations, freedom of navigation on the South China Sea, intellectual property theft, and military ambitions. However, the statement also sparked a massive reaction worldwide, portraying a complex interplay of diplomacy, politics, and ideology involved with the relationship between two of the world's superpowers.</p>
  <h2>Some Examples</h2>
  <p>It is not the first instance for Biden to call out China's policy. In 2020, he defended his support for Taiwan and Hong Kong against China's ruling party. He also criticized Trump's trade war and highlighted China's malignant role in handling the Wuhan virus crisis, hinting at its delay in informing the world. The global pandemic, coupled with China's aggressive stance across the Indo-Pacific, has also changed the global perception towards China.</p>
  <p>The US has been vigilant about China's growing influence and violation of human rights, leading to a range of initiatives. Some of them include:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Sanctioning Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC)- A Paramilitary organization accused of involvement in Uighur and other minority abuses.</li>
   <li>Banning US investment in firms linked to Chinese Military and its surveillance apparatus.</li>
   <li>Banning entry of Chinese officials engaged in Uighur human rights abuses in Xinjiang.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Such declarations from the US have pushed other countries to follow suit and focus on degrading their dependence on China for vital industries. Countries like India, Japan, and Australia have adopted a strategic partnership to counterbalance China in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <h3>Uighur Muslims</h3>
  <p>The US has accused China of ethnic cleansing against the Uighur minority in Xinjiang, where millions are closely monitored, and thousands have been taken to internment camps. The US has imposed sanctions and visa restrictions on government officers and lawmakers accused of abusing human rights in Xinjiang. The US government has also appealed to supply chain leaders to verify if their products have utilized forced labor.</p>
  <h3>South China Sea</h3>
  <p>China's aggressive policy in the South China Sea has been a source of conflict with other Asian countries. China has built military installations and begun drilling natural resources in the disputed waters. In response, the US has conducted naval exercises, challenged China's territorial claims, and protested at international forums, supporting countries like the Philippines and Vietnam.</p>
  <h3>Tech War</h3>
  <p>The US has accused China of forcefully acquiring its technology through theft, espionage, and coercion. It has challenged Chinese telecommunication firms like Huawei and ZTE and banned their entry in the US market. The US-China trade war has seen tariffs and counter-tariffs leading to huge losses for both countries.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>While the US-China relationship can be cordial, it has been in an uneasy deadlock for almost a year. Biden's call out to China's leader defines his approach towards China diplomacy. However, given the complex interdependence between the two economies, it remains challenging to delineate between economic and human rights agendas. Nevertheless, the US-China relationship remains crucial, as any strategic misstep can have a massive impact on global stability.</p>
  <p>Therefore, the conclusion in three points can be:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Biden's readiness to call out China reflects his commitment to addressing China's nefarious policies.</li>
   <li>Human Rights violations, technology war, and military expansionism remain the most pressing issues of contention between the US and China.</li>
   <li>Avoiding conflicts and working on a strategic partnership remains critical for global peace and stability.</li>
  </ol>
