   <p>Geopolitics is a complex and dynamic field that often involves competing interests and conflicting goals between nations. In recent years, India and China have emerged as two of the world's most important players in this area, with each country seeking to expand its influence and assert its dominance in various regions around the globe.</p>
   <p>However, this pursuit of power and influence can sometimes lead to petty squabbles and geopolitical maneuvers that are more about politics than actual security concerns. One recent example of this is the ongoing spat between India and China over a Pak-based terrorist, where both sides are engaging in tit-for-tat moves that are doing more harm than good.</p>
   <h2>The Background</h2>
   <p>The current dispute between India and China centers around Masood Azhar, the leader of a militant group called Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) that is based in Pakistan. Azhar is accused of masterminding several major terrorist attacks in India, including the 2019 Pulwama attack that killed 40 Indian soldiers.</p>
   <p>India has been pushing for Azhar to be designated as a global terrorist by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) for several years. However, China has been blocking these efforts, citing lack of evidence and arguing that the issue should be resolved through bilateral talks between India and Pakistan.</p>
   <p>In response, India has been working to isolate Pakistan diplomatically, calling for countries around the world to cut ties with the country and avoid conducting trade or business with its government. However, China has been a major supporter of Pakistan in the international arena, providing it with economic and military aid and blocking efforts to curb its nuclear ambitions and terrorist activities.</p>
   <h2>The Impact</h2>
   <p>The ongoing dispute between India and China over Masood Azhar has had several negative impacts on the region and wider world, including:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Increased tensions between India and Pakistan: The ongoing diplomatic and military skirmishes between India and Pakistan, both of whom possess nuclear weapons, have raised concerns about an all-out war between the two countries.</li>
    <li>Destabilization of South Asia: The continued support for and tolerance of terrorist groups operating in Pakistan by China, and to a lesser extent by Russia, has contributed to the instability of the region and made it more vulnerable to extremist attacks.</li>
    <li>Undermining of international law: The inability of the UNSC to act in the face of clear evidence of terrorist activities carries profound implications for global security and stability, as it undermines the credibility of the international community and the rule of law.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>The Way Forward</h2>
   <p>In order to address the current situation and prevent the escalation of tensions between India and China, there are several steps that can be taken, including:</p>
   <blockquote>
    "It is time for both India and China to put aside their petty geopolitical interests and focus on the larger goal of global security and stability. This means working together to dismantle terrorist networks and address the root causes of extremism, rather than engaging in counterproductive posturing and power plays that only serve to undermine the very peace and security they claim to be seeking."
   </blockquote>
   <p>Specific actions that can be taken to achieve this goal may include:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Engaging in diplomatic talks: Both India and China need to engage in constructive dialogue and work together to identify common goals and shared interests. This could involve face-to-face meetings between high-level officials or the establishment of working groups and committees to tackle specific issues.</li>
    <li>Disrupting terrorist activities: The international community needs to come together to combat terrorist groups and disrupt their activities. This may involve sharing intelligence, providing funding and resources to affected countries, and adopting a more coordinated response to terrorist threats.</li>
    <li>Strengthening international law: The UNSC needs to be strengthened and given more power to enforce its resolutions. This could involve reforms to the structure and mandate of the organization, as well as greater cooperation and coordination between its member states.</li>
   </ul>
