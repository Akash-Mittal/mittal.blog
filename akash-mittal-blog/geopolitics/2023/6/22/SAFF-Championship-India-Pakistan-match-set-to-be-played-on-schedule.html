  <p>It is no secret that sports can bring nations together. It provides an opportunity for individuals to come together and celebrate a common interest. However, sometimes it is the very same reason that causes polarisation amongst people.</p>
  <p>The upcoming SAFF Championship match between India and Pakistan is a classic example. Although the match is set to be played on schedule, the political tensions between the two neighbouring countries have been providing an intense backdrop to the sporting event.</p>
  <h2>The History of India-Pakistan Sporting Rivalry</h2>
  <p>The India-Pakistan sporting rivalry has its roots in the political tensions between the two countries. The two nations were formed in 1947 on the basis of religious identity - India for Hindus and Pakistan for Muslims. This resulted in a communal partition, causing displacement, riots, and deaths of up to two million people.</p>
  <p>As a result of this partition, the two countries have engaged in three major wars, including the one in 1971, resulting in the creation of Bangladesh. The rivalry extends beyond the cricket field and includes other sports such as hockey, kabaddi, and even chess.</p>
  <h2>Instances of Sporting Rivalry Conflict between India and Pakistan</h2>
  <p>The rivalry between India and Pakistan has been known to spill onto the sports field. Below are a few instances of conflict between the two countries in the sporting arena:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The 1999 Kargil War between the two countries began after Pakistan-backed militants were found inside the Indian Kashmir region. This led to the cancellation of the cricket series between the two nations. It took three years for India and Pakistan to compete against each other in a cricket match.</li>
   <li>In 2014, the Indian Hockey team had to withdraw from the Champions Trophy that was to be held in Pakistan due to security reasons.</li>
   <li>In 2016, the Indian Kabaddi team refused to travel to Pakistan for the World Cup. Later, they agreed to play the Pakistan team on neutral grounds in Dubai.</li>
  </ul>
