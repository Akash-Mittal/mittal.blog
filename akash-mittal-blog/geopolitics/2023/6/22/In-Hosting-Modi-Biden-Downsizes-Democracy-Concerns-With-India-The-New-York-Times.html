    <p>India and the US have always shared a tumultuous relationship, but it reached a new level when Joe Biden, the current President of the United States, invited the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, to a bilateral meeting. While many expected this meeting to address concerns over democracy, human rights, and freedom, Biden's administration downplayed the issues, signaling a shift in priorities for the relationship between the world's largest democracies.</p>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>This shift was particularly evident in the way the White House described the meeting. The official statement from the White House made no mention of concerns over democracy or human rights, instead focusing on a wide range of issues such as climate change, regional security, and economic ties. While some may argue that these issues are of equal importance, the exclusion of democracy concerns was widely criticized, indicating the shifting priorities of the US.</p>
    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>One particular case study that highlights the impact of this shift is that of Kashif-ul-Huda, a journalist based in the US. He shared his experience in an op-ed for Al Jazeera, stating that he was surprised to see the Biden administration prioritizing economic ties with India over issues such as press freedom and democracy. He also went on to say that this shift in priorities is not just limited to the US administration but also affects the way the media covers India-related issues. He mentioned how major news outlets tend to focus on the positive aspects of the US-India relationship, such as trade and defense, instead of critical issues such as human rights abuses and press freedom violations.</p>
    <h2></h2>
