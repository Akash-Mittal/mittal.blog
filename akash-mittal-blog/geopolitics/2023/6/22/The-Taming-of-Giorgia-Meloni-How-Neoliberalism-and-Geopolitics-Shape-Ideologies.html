  <p>Once upon a time, a young politician named Giorgia Meloni rose to power in Italy. She was charismatic, ambitious and had a clear vision of how she wanted to transform the country. Meloni presented herself as a defender of national identity, conservative values and economic liberalism. She embraced an anti-immigrant stance and promised to put 'Italians first'. Her rhetoric resonated with many voters who were disillusioned with traditional parties and challenged by globalisation.</p>
  <p>However, Meloni soon discovered that her agenda faced significant obstacles, both domestically and internationally. She realised that her vision of Italy was not only shaped by her own ideology, but also by larger forces that she could not control. Neoliberalism and geopolitics were influencing her policies, even if she did not fully understand or acknowledge their impact. This article explores how Meloni's political trajectory reflects the wider tensions between neoliberalism and geopolitics, and how ideology can be both a product and a tool of those tensions.</p>
  <h2>Neoliberalism, Geopolitics and Ideology</h2>
  <p>Neoliberalism is an economic philosophy that favours free markets, private enterprise and limited government intervention. It has been dominant in most Western societies since the 1980s and has led to deregulation, privatisation, and globalisation. Neoliberalism's proponents argue that it has improved productivity, innovation and consumer choice, but its critics claim that it has worsened inequality, insecurity and social cohesion. Neoliberalism has had a profound impact on political ideologies, as parties across the political spectrum have embraced its principles to different degrees.</p>
  <p>Geopolitics is the study of how geography, resources and power shape international relations. It focuses on the interaction between states and how they compete for influence, security and resources. Geopolitics is concerned with issues such as military strategy, economic diplomacy, environmental degradation and cultural clashes. Geopolitics has become increasingly relevant in a world that has become more interconnected and interdependent, but also more fragmented and conflict-prone. Geopolitics can also influence domestic politics, as states try to balance external threats and internal needs.</p>
  <p>Ideology is a set of beliefs, values and visions that guide political action. Ideology can be shaped by cultural, historical, economic and technological factors. Ideology can be both a source of coherence and division, as it can define who belongs and who does not, who benefits and who suffers, and what is valuable and what is not. Ideology can also be used to justify or legitimise power, as it can create myths, narratives and symbols that mobilise and persuade people.</p>
  <h2>The Taming of Giorgia Meloni</h2>
  <p>Giorgia Meloni started her political career in the youth wing of the right-wing National Alliance party. She became a member of parliament in 2008 and served as minister for youth and sport under Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. However, she became disillusioned with Berlusconi's leadership and joined the newly formed Brothers of Italy party in 2012. Meloni became the party's leader in 2014 and led it to a strong showing in the 2018 general elections.</p>
  <p>However, Meloni faced several challenges in reconciling her vision of Italy with the realities of neoliberalism and geopolitics. One example is immigration. Meloni argued that Italy should restrict immigration to protect its cultural and economic interests. She accused the European Union of forcing Italy to accept too many migrants and failing to secure its borders. She also advocated for a tougher stance on refugees and demanded that NGOs operating rescue boats in the Mediterranean be banned. However, Meloni's anti-immigrant rhetoric clashed with the neoliberal principle of free movement of labour, which was enshrined in the EU treaties. Moreover, Italy's economy relied on low-skilled immigrant labour in many sectors, such as agriculture, domestic work, and construction. These contradictions made it difficult for Meloni to implement her immigration policies without causing economic disruption and legal challenges.</p>
  <p>Another example is foreign policy. Meloni expressed strong support for Israel and criticised the Palestinian Authority and Hamas. She called for closer ties with the United States and NATO and for a more assertive role in the Mediterranean. She also praised Russia for its opposition to Islamic terrorism and its promotion of traditional values. However, Meloni's foreign policy ambitions clashed with the geopolitics of the EU and the global order. The EU is committed to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and opposes Israeli settlements in the occupied territories. The EU also seeks to maintain a balance between the US and Russia and to engage with both, rather than choosing sides. Meloni's alignment with Israel and Russia risked isolating Italy and undermining its diplomatic standing.</p>
  <p>A third example is economic policy. Meloni championed the lowering of taxes, the simplification of bureaucracy and the promotion of entrepreneurship. She argued that these policies would boost economic growth and create jobs. She also criticised the EU's austerity policies and called for more fiscal autonomy for Italy. However, Meloni's economic policies clashed with the neoliberal paradigm that emphasises fiscal discipline and market liberalisation. The EU imposes strict rules on budget deficits and debt levels and requires member states to undertake structural reforms. Meloni's proposals risked putting Italy on a collision course with the EU and the financial markets.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Giorgia Meloni's political trajectory illustrates how neoliberalism and geopolitics can influence political ideologies and constrain political action. Meloni's attempts to reconcile her nationalist, conservative and liberal ideas with the realities of the EU, the global order and the Italian economy faced significant challenges and contradictions. Meloni discovered that her ideology was not a pure product of her own convictions, but was shaped by larger forces that she had to navigate, negotiate and compromise with. This article suggests three points that can be drawn from Meloni's experience:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Ideologies are not static, but dynamic. They can change, adapt and evolve depending on the context and the actors involved. Ideologies can be subject to internal and external pressures, which can challenge or reinforce them. Ideologies can also be tools that actors use to achieve their goals or legitimise their power, rather than genuine expressions of their beliefs and values.</li>
   <li>Neoliberalism and geopolitics can both enable and constrain political action. Neoliberalism can promote economic growth and innovation, but can also exacerbate inequality and insecurity. Geopolitics can create opportunities for cooperation and peace, but can also generate conflict and hegemony. Neoliberalism and geopolitics can shape, distort or subvert ideologies, depending on how they are used and understood.</li>
   <li>Ideologies are not neutral, but contested. Ideologies can represent the interests of some groups and exclude or marginalise others. Ideologies can create myths, narratives and symbols that mobilise and divide people. Ideologies can also be challenged, critiqued and transformed by alternative discourses, actors and practices. Ideologies are not monolithic, but pluralistic.</li>
