  <p></p>
  <p>Saudi Arabia and Iran are two of the most influential nations in the Middle East, both economically and politically. They are also home to the two largest Muslim communities in the region - the Sunnis and the Shiites. Relations between the two nations have been tumultuous since the 1979 Iranian Revolution, but the tension reached new heights in January 2016 when Saudi Arabia executed a prominent Shiite cleric, Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr. The execution sparked outrage in Iran, and the subsequent attacks on the Saudi embassy in Tehran led to a complete breakdown in diplomatic relations.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The hostility between Saudi Arabia and Iran has been fueled by a number of factors, including religious and ideological differences, geopolitical competition, and economic interests. Both countries have been involved in proxy wars across the region, with Saudi Arabia supporting Sunni groups and Iran backing Shiite forces. The conflict has played out in Yemen, Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon, with devastating consequences for civilians caught in the middle.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One of the main issues at the heart of the Saudi-Iranian rivalry is the struggle for regional dominance. Saudi Arabia sees Iran as a threat to its position as the leader of the Sunni Muslim world and has been working to counter Iranian influence in the region. This has involved supporting Sunni militants, such as the group that overthrew the government in Yemen, and opposing Iranian-backed Shiite groups, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon. Iran, on the other hand, sees itself as the leader of the Shiite world and has been working to expand its influence in the region. This has involved supporting Shiite groups in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, and opposing Sunni groups, such as ISIS.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran has had significant implications for global affairs. It has fueled sectarian tensions across the region, leading to the rise of extremist groups such as ISIS. It has also had a major impact on oil prices, as tensions between the two nations have led to speculation that supply could be disrupted. In addition, the conflict has had a significant impact on international relations, with many countries taking sides and exacerbating the tension between the two nations.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case studies:</p>
  <p>The conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran has played out in a number of countries across West Asia, including Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq. In Yemen, Saudi Arabia has been leading a coalition of Sunni nations to combat the Iran-backed Houthi rebels. The conflict has resulted in a humanitarian crisis, with millions of people suffering from starvation and disease. In Syria, Iran has been backing the Assad government, while Saudi Arabia has been supporting opposition groups. The conflict has led to the displacement of millions of people and has created a vacuum for extremist groups such as ISIS to thrive. In Lebanon, Iran has been supporting the Shiite group Hezbollah, while Saudi Arabia has been working to counter its influence. The conflict has led to a political crisis in Lebanon and has raised concerns about the potential for a new war. In Iraq, the conflict has played out in the form of a power struggle between Sunni and Shiite groups, with Iran backing the Shiite government and Saudi Arabia supporting Sunni groups.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion:</p>
  <p>1) The ongoing conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran has the potential to redefine the geopolitical landscape of West Asia, with significant impacts on global affairs.</p>
  <p>2) The conflict has been fueled by a number of factors, including religious and ideological differences, geopolitical competition, and economic interests.</p>
  <p>3) The conflict has had significant implications for global affairs, including the rise of extremist groups such as ISIS and the impact on oil prices.</p>
