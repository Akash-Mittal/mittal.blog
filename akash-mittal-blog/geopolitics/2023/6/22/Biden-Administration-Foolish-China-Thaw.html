  <p>Once upon a time, a small business owner named John decided to import some goods from China. However, he faced numerous challenges such as high tariffs, language barriers, and complicated regulations. John started to question why the U.S government continued to have a friendly relationship with China and eased trade restrictions, while small businesses like himself struggled to compete. Unfortunately, this story has become a reality under the Biden Administration.</p>
  <h2>Examples of the China Thaw</h2>
  <p>President Biden has taken a softer stance on China, removing some of the sanctions and tariffs imposed by the previous administration. One significant example is the revocation of the ban on Chinese apps, such as TikTok and WeChat. Additionally, the Biden Administration has relaxed the travel ban and suspended Trump's executive orders on WeChat and TikTok's operations. These moves are seen as a shift in favor of Chinese interests, allowing them to expand their foothold in the U.S.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>The China Thaw has led to various companies facing the heat and bearing the consequences of increased competition from China. One such example is the American solar panel manufacturer, First Solar, which has been struggling to compete with cheaper Chinese panels. Additionally, the U.S steel industry has been grappling with China's dumping practices that have led to decreased demand for U.S steel. This has caused many steelworkers to lose their jobs and led to the closure of many steel mills across the country.</p>
  <h2></h2>
  <ol>
   <li>The Biden Administration's decision to thaw relations with China is short-sighted and dangerous for the U.S economy.</li>
   <li>The U.S should remain cautious when dealing with China and impose stricter restrictions on Chinese goods and companies operating on U.S soil.</li>
   <li>The U.S should prioritize its own interests over China's and focus on revitalizing its industries and creating job opportunities for its citizens.</li>
