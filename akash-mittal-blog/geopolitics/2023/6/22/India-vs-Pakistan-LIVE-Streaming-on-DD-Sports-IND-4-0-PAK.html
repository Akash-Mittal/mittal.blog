    <h2>Examples of India's Dominance</h2>
    <p>Throughout the match, the Indian team showed why they are one of the best teams in the world. Their fielding was exceptional, with every player putting their body on the line to save runs. The batting was also top notch, with every player contributing to the victory.</p>
    <p>One example of India's dominance was their fast bowlers who made it difficult for the Pakistani batsmen to score runs. The pace and swing of the ball were too much for them to handle, which resulted in several wickets being taken.</p>
    <p>Another example was the opening partnership between Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan. They made quick runs and set the pace for the rest of the team to follow. This gave the Indian team a good start and put pressure on the Pakistani team to play catch-up.</p>
