  <p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken embarked on his first visit to China under the Biden administration with a notion of balancing the country's important economic ties with China and confrontation over human rights issues. Unfortunately, his attempts to ease concerns and enhance relations were unsuccessful. Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared to have shown a stand-offish attitude towards Blinken during their talks, and there were no signs from both countries on a way forward to resolve the issues.</p>
  <h2>Examples of the Balancing Act</h2>
  <p>The US State Department's own website shows the Biden administration's efforts on the China front as an attempt to balance "competition with cooperation." Maintaining the world's largest economy and a historic political power, the US has always seen China as a key player in the global economic order. Policy analysts have repeatedly stressed that the country has to balance important, yet competing interests that lie on either side of ideological and diplomatic fences. For instance,</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The Department of Commerce's "Entity List," which bans specific companies from doing business with US firms due to suspected involvement in human rights abuses, was updated in June to include five new Chinese companies. The Biden administration has signaled its intention to keep up the pressure on China over human rights violations, just like the Trump administration.</li>
   <li>In February, President Biden ordered a study to assess the risk posed by China's supply chain. The study is aimed at identifying developing vulnerabilities in the supply chain and evaluating possible ways of mitigating them. At the same time, he reassured that the US will also work to strengthen its own supply chain.</li>
   <li>In a speech last week, Blinken referred to human rights abuses, the rise of China, and the need to work with like-minded nations to "manage the competition" with the country. "It is not our objective to contain China, to hold China down. It is our objective to uphold the international rules-based order in the face of authoritarianism and assertiveness," he said.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>Two striking examples that demonstrate the difficulties of balancing the US's economic ties with China with concerns over human rights include the case of Xinjiang and Hong Kong. The Xinjiang region in western China, home to the Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups, has been the scene of persistent human rights abuses. Reports of torture, forced labor, and mass detention camps have been detailed by many countries and human rights organizations, resulting in the US placing sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for these abuses. China has responded by denying allegations and condemning US interference.</p>
  <p>In Hong Kong, China has been eroding the one-country, two-systems principle with which the territory has been governed since it was handed back to China by the UK in 1997. Since pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong began in early 2019, Beijing has imposed a new national security law and cracked down on civil liberties, mass arrests of pro-democracy activists and journalists, a sweeping crackdown on internet freedom. The US has responded by recognizing Hong Kong as being autonomous from China, and has placed sanctions on officials responsible for undermining freedom there.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion in Three Points</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>The Blinken China visit did not result in any diplomatic breakthroughs between China and the US.</li>
   <li>China is highly sensitive to any perceived interference in its internal affairs, particularly when it comes to sensitive issues like Xinjiang and Hong Kong.</li>
   <li>The US's relationship with China is guaranteed to remain a key and complex foreign policy challenge for the foreseeable future.</li>
  </ol>
