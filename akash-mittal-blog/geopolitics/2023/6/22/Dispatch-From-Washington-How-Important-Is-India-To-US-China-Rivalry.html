   <p>When it comes to the geopolitical rivalry of the century, India is emerging as a key player in the competition between the United States and China. As the two superpowers jockey for dominance, India's position in the global arena is critical to the outcome. But just how important is India in the bigger picture?</p>
   
   <p>On June 15, 2020, a violent scuffle between Indian and Chinese troops along the disputed border in the Galwan Valley left 20 Indian soldiers dead. The incident marked the deadliest clash between the two nuclear-armed rivals in decades and sparked outrage in India.</p>
   <p>As tensions between India and China simmered, the United States started to take notice. In July 2020, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared that the US would support India in its border dispute with China.</p>
   <p>"The Chinese took incredibly aggressive actions. The Indians have done their best to respond to that," Pompeo told reporters. "I have spoken with Foreign Minister [of India] S. Jaishankar a number of times about this. We continue to support the Indian government's efforts to protect its sovereignty."</p>
   <h2>Examples</h2>
   <p>The US has been strengthening its ties with India over the past few years, with both countries looking to counter China's rise in the region. In 2018, the US renamed its Pacific Command to the Indo-Pacific Command, a move seen as a clear signal of the importance the US places on India in its strategic calculations.</p>
   <p>In addition to military ties, the US and India have been growing their economic relationship. In 2019, then-President Donald Trump welcomed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Houston, Texas, where the two leaders spoke at a "Howdy Modi" rally attended by 50,000 people. The event highlighted the growing ties between the two countries, with both leaders promising to increase trade and investment.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <p>The importance of India in the US-China rivalry was evident in 2020, when India banned dozens of Chinese mobile apps, including the popular social media app TikTok. The move was seen as a response to China's growing influence over the Indian economy and its assertive behavior along the shared border.</p>
   <p>China responded with its own ban on Indian apps, and tensions between the two countries continued to escalate. But the US saw an opportunity to strengthen its ties with India, and in October 2020, the US and India signed a key military pact that allows for greater cooperation between the two countries in countering China's growing influence in the region.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>India's position in the global arena is critical to the outcome of the US-China rivalry.</li>
    <li>The US sees India as a key player in countering China's rise in the region and has been strengthening its ties with India over the past few years.</li>
    <li>The escalating tensions between India and China have created an opportunity for the US to deepen its relationship with India, and the two countries have signed a key military pact that allows for greater cooperation in countering China's growing influence in the region.</li>
