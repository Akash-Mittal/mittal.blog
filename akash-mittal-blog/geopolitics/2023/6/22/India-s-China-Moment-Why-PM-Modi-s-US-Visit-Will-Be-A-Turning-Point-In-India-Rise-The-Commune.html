    <h3>An Interesting Story</h3>
    <p>On a hot summer day in 2017, a small village in the Indian state of Punjab made headlines around the world. The reason? Its residents had just broken a world record for planting the most number of trees in a single day. Over 800,000 saplings were planted by volunteers in just 12 hours, beating the previous record of 50,033 set in Pakistan in 2013.</p>
    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <p>This small village's achievement is just one example of India's growing ambition to become a global superpower. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has been making strides in various sectors such as technology, infrastructure, and renewable energy. For instance, the country's tech industry is predicted to reach a value of $350 billion by 2025, while it has set a target of installing 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022.</p>
    <h3>Case Studies</h3>
    <p>Another area where India is making its mark is in the healthcare sector. The country has become a hub for medical tourism, attracting patients from around the world for treatments ranging from heart surgeries to fertility treatments. In addition, India has made progress in tackling diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis, and has been at the forefront of developing affordable healthcare solutions.</p>
    <p>Yet, India's rise is not without challenges. In particular, it faces stiff competition from China, which has emerged as a global economic powerhouse in recent years. China's Belt and Road Initiative, a massive infrastructure project spanning several countries, has caused concern in India due to its potential strategic implications. Moreover, China has been investing heavily in cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, posing a threat to India's tech industry.</p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Despite these challenges, Prime Minister Modi's upcoming visit to the US could be a turning point in India's rise as a global superpower. Here are three key takeaways:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>The visit will provide an opportunity for India to strengthen its strategic and economic ties with the US, a key ally in the region. This could include signing new trade deals and collaborations in areas such as technology and defence.</li>
     <li>India can showcase its achievements in sectors such as technology, healthcare, and renewable energy, and seek US support in areas where it faces challenges such as climate change and cybersecurity.</li>
     <li>The visit can help India present itself as a credible alternative to China in the region, and signal to the world that it is ready to take on a bigger role in shaping the global order.</li>
