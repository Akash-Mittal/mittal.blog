     <p>On June 8, 2016, Narendra Modi became the fifth Indian Prime Minister to address a joint session of the US Congress. For the most part, the Indian leader was welcomed warmly by the Congressmen. However, some Progressive Democrats, like Representatives Keith Ellison and Tulsi Gabbard, decided to boycott Modi's speech. They had their reasons.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
     <h2>Examples</h2>
     <p>Keith Ellison, Representative from Minnesota, explained his decision to boycott the speech by saying that he disliked Modi's style of governance. He accused the Indian Prime Minister of oppressing minorities, stifling free speech, and promoting Hindu nationalism. Ellison said that Modi's record on human rights was "worrisome."</p>
     <p>Tulsi Gabbard, Representative from Hawaii and an Iraq War veteran, also expressed her reservations about Modi's speech. Gabbard said that she stood with those who were fighting against religious discrimination. She believed that the decision to invite Modi was insensitive to the plight of minorities and Dalits (the lowest caste in the Indian social hierarchy).</p>
     <p>The two Congressmen were not alone in their opposition to Modi. Several non-profit organizations like Alliance for Justice and Accountability (AJA) and Indian American Muslim Council (IAMC) also criticized Modi's visit. They accused him of being complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots when he was Chief Minister of the state, and demanded that the US government revoke his visa.</p>

     <h2>Case Studies</h2>
     <p>The Gujarat riots were a major flashpoint in Modi's career. In 2002, over 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed in a series of riots that erupted after a train carrying Hindu pilgrims was set on fire. Modi was accused of not doing enough to stop the violence and even stoking religious animosity. Later, the Indian Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigative Team (SIT) exonerated Modi of any wrongdoing.</p>
     <p>However, the controversy has not died down completely. In 2013, Modi was denied a US visa on the grounds of his alleged complicity in the riots. After becoming the Prime Minister of India in 2014, Modi visited the US several times, but avoided going to California (where many Indian Americans live) for fear of protests by human rights groups.</p>
     <p>Modi's critics say that his visit to the US Congress is part of a larger strategy to burnish his international image and deflect attention from his domestic policies. They argue that the invitation to Modi sends a message that the US is willing to overlook human rights abuses for the sake of business ties with India â€“ a country that is seen as an important ally in Asia.</p>
