    <h2>Interesting Story</h2>
    <p>In a recent turn of events, China blocked India's proposal at the United Nations to blacklist Sajid Mir, the mastermind of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks in 2008. This move by China has been condemned by India, which called it mere "petty geopolitics". This is not the first instance where China has blocked India's efforts in the international community, creating tensions between the two neighboring countries.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>China's blocking of India's proposal to blacklist Sajid Mir is just one example of how China has been trying to block India's efforts in the international community. Here are some other instances:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>China has been blocking India's membership at the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) for years.</li>
     <li>China also opposes India's bid for a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council.</li>
     <li>China has been supporting Pakistan, India's arch-rival, which has been a major challenge for Indian foreign policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>China's attempts to block India's efforts in the international community have not only created tensions between the two countries but have also had real-world implications. Here are some case studies to understand the impact of China's actions:</p>
    <h3>Impact on the NSG Membership</h3>
    <p>China's opposition to India's NSG membership has prevented India from being a part of one of the most important international groups for civil nuclear cooperation. This has affected India's ability to access state-of-the-art nuclear technology, which is essential for India's economic growth. In addition, India's exclusion from the NSG has also made it more difficult for India to fight climate change, as it is unable to access clean energy technology.</p>
    <h3>Impact on the India-China Relations</h3>
    <p>China's support for Pakistan and its opposition to India's position on various global forums has created tension between the two countries. This has complicated India's relations with China, which is one of the world's biggest superpowers. The ongoing border dispute and China's support for Pakistan are just some of the issues that have strained the India-China relationship in recent years.</p>
