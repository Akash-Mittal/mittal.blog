  <p>It was a fine day in Baghdad when Bilawal Bhutto, the Chairman of Pakistan People's Party (PPP), stepped on the Iraqi soil for a historic visit. People of Pakistan were eagerly waiting for news from their leader about a possible breakthrough for the long-standing Kashmir issue, a matter that has caused numerous conflicts with the neighbouring India. However, the final joint document released by the two countries declared nothing about Kashmir and left many disappointed.</p>
  <h2>Why is Kashmir so Critical for Pakistan?</h2>
  <p>Kashmir is a disputed region between India and Pakistan since the partition of British India in 1947. It is a Muslim-majority state and has caused violence and conflicts between the two countries for decades. Both Pakistan and India possess nuclear weapons, making the situation even more complex and dangerous.</p>
  <p>For Pakistan, Kashmir holds an emotional significance as it considers the region as its own, and any compromise or negotiation is seen as a weakness. Thus, Bilawal Bhutto's visit to Iraq was seen as a significant opportunity to persuade Iraq to support Pakistan's stance on Kashmir.</p>
  <h2>The Joint Document with Iraq</h2>
  <p>The joint document released by Bilawal Bhutto and Iraq's Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi declared mutual support on various issues of international importance. These included the fight against terrorism and extremism, strengthening trade and investment, and promoting regional peace and stability.</p>
  <p>However, the document did not mention anything about Kashmir or Pakistan's stance on the issue. The absence of Kashmir from the joint document created a wave of disappointment and frustration among the people of Pakistan.</p>
  <h2>The Significance of the Visit</h2>
  <p>Bilawal Bhutto's visit to Iraq was significant for Pakistan on many levels. It was the first visit by a Pakistani leader to Iraq since the fall of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein in 2003. Additionally, it was an opportunity to strengthen the ties between the two countries and to explore new avenues of cooperation.</p>
  <p>Bilawal Bhutto also visited the holy city of Najaf and met with Iraq's most senior Shia cleric, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. The meeting was seen as a gesture of goodwill between the two countries, as Pakistan is a predominantly Sunni Muslim country.</p>
  <h2>The Kashmir Issue and its Impact on Pakistan</h2>
  <p>The Kashmir issue is a sensitive matter for Pakistan and has caused numerous conflicts and tensions with India. The lack of progress on the issue has also affected Pakistan's diplomatic relations with other countries.</p>
  <p>In recent years, Pakistan has been trying to seek support from international forums, such as the United Nations, to resolve the issue. Bilawal Bhutto's visit to Iraq was seen as a part of this effort to gain support for Pakistan's stance on Kashmir.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <h3>India's Reaction</h3>
  <p>India responded to Bilawal Bhutto's visit to Iraq by stating that the Kashmir issue is a bilateral matter between India and Pakistan and that it should not be discussed with other countries. India's stance on the issue has remained unchanged for decades, and it has always advocated for bilateral talks to resolve the issue.</p>
  <h3>Pakistan's Political Opposition</h3>
  <p>Many politicians and leaders from opposition parties in Pakistan criticized Bilawal Bhutto's visit to Iraq, stating that it was a waste of taxpayers' money and did not yield any concrete results. Opposition leaders also accused Bilawal Bhutto of using the visit for political gain.</p>
  <h3>International Community</h3>
  <p>The international community has been urging India and Pakistan to resolve the Kashmir issue through dialogue and negotiation. However, no significant progress has been made, and tensions between the two countries have continued.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Bilawal Bhutto's visit to Iraq was highly anticipated by the people of Pakistan, but it did not yield any concrete results regarding the Kashmir issue. The absence of Kashmir from the joint document between the two countries has created a wave of disappointment and frustration among the people of Pakistan.</p>
  <p>However, the visit was significant in strengthening the ties between Pakistan and Iraq and exploring new avenues of cooperation. Bilawal Bhutto's meeting with Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani in Najaf was also seen as a positive step towards promoting regional peace and stability.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, the Kashmir issue remains a critical matter for Pakistan, and it will require a sustained effort from the international community to resolve the issue through peaceful means.</p>
