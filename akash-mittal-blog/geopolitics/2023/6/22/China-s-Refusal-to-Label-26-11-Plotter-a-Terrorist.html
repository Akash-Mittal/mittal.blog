    <p>The 2008 Mumbai attacks, also referred to as 26/11, shook the world and left a long-lasting impact on India. The coordinated terrorist attacks lasted for three days and claimed the lives of 166 people while injuring over 300. The attack was carried out by a group of ten Pakistani terrorists belonging to the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) militant group.</p>
    <p>As India continues to seek justice for the victims of the Mumbai attacks, China's recent refusal to label one of the suspects as a terrorist has raised questions about international cooperation against terrorism.</p>
    <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
    <p>Hafiz Saeed, the founder of Lashkar-e-Taiba, was designated as a terrorist by the United Nations in 2008. However, Masood Azhar, the founder of another militant group called Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), has consistently evaded designation as a terrorist by the UN due to China's veto power in the Security Council.</p>
    <p>In 2019, China again blocked India's bid to designate Masood Azhar as a global terrorist in the UN Security Council. This move was widely criticized by the international community and India for China's lack of commitment to combating terrorism.</p>
    <h2 id="casestudies">Case Studies</h2>
    <p>The case of China's refusal to label Zaki ur Rehman Lakhvi, one of the main planners of the Mumbai attacks, as a terrorist is another example of the lack of international cooperation in the fight against terrorism.</p>
    <p>In 2016, India had submitted a dossier containing evidence of Lakhvi's involvement in the terrorist attack. Despite this, China refused to designate Lakhvi as a terrorist, citing lack of evidence. In response, India criticized China's stance and the international community questioned China's commitment to counter-terrorism.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>China's refusal to designate individuals responsible for terrorist attacks as terrorists has raised questions about its commitment to counter-terrorism.</li>
     <li>It highlights the need for greater international cooperation in combating the global menace of terrorism.</li>
     <li>India and the international community must continue to hold China accountable for its stance on terrorism and push for stronger action against those responsible for such heinous acts.</li>
