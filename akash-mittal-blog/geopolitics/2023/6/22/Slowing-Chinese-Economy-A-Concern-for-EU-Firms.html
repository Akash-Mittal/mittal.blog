   <!-- Story -->
   <p>It was a cold winter day in Brussels when the executives of a large European automobile company met to discuss their strategy for the upcoming fiscal year. As they sipped their coffee and flipped through their briefing documents, they couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. Their biggest market, China, had started to show signs of a slowing economy and mounting debts. They knew they had to act fast before it was too late.</p><!-- Examples -->
   <p>This scenario is not unique. In fact, a survey conducted by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China found that the slowing Chinese economy is a greater concern for EU firms than geopolitics. The survey, which polled nearly 400 European companies operating in China, revealed that 50% of respondents cited the economic slowdown as their biggest challenge, while only 29% were worried about the ongoing trade disputes and geopolitical tensions.</p><!-- Case Studies -->
   <h2>Case Study 1: Luxury Brands Struggle in China</h2>
   <p>The struggling Chinese economy has particularly hit the luxury goods industry – a sector that has been booming in the country in recent years. According to research firm Bain &amp; Company, the luxury market in China has experienced its slowest growth rate in a decade, with sales expected to drop by up to 6% in 2019. Firms such as Prada and Salvatore Ferragamo have reported significant drops in sales in China, causing them to rethink their strategies and turn towards more affordable options.</p>
   <h2>Case Study 2: Automotive Industry Feels the Pinch</h2>
   <p>The Chinese automotive industry, which is one of the world's largest, has also been affected by the slowing economy. Sales have been dropping for more than a year, with the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers reporting a 5.8% decline in sales in 2018. European carmakers such as BMW and Daimler have been hit hard by these declining sales, and have been forced to cut their profit forecasts and implement cost-saving measures.</p><!-- Conclusion -->
   <h2>Conclusion: Why the Slowing Chinese Economy is a Greater Concern</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>The EU firms are highly dependent on China as their biggest market. Any slowdown will have a significant impact on their profitability.</li>
    <li>The trade disputes and geopolitical tensions are viewed as temporary issues by EU firms, while the slowing economy seems to be a more systemic problem that may persist for a longer period.</li>
    <li>The Chinese economy has been a key driver of global growth in recent years. With its slowing, the world economy may also face challenges.</li>
