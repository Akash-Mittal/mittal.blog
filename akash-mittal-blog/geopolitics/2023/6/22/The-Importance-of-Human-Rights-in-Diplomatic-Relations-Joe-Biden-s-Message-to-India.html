  <p>Joe Biden's recent visit to India has been a hot topic around the globe. The President of the United States used this opportunity to discuss the relationship between India and the United States and also to raise concerns about human rights in India. Biden's message of support for India's democratic and pluralistic values was well received by many people around the world. However, his indirect nudge for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to address human rights issues in India has sparked a lot of attention and debates.</p>
  <h2>The Importance of Human Rights in Diplomatic Relations</h2>
  <p>Human rights are universal, inalienable and indivisible. The protection of human rights is essential in maintaining peace, security and stability in the world. It is no longer an internal matter of any country, but a global concern. In this context, it is essential to promote human rights as a key component of foreign policy and diplomacy. Diplomatic relations should be based on the respect for human rights, democracy, and rule of law.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Human Rights Violations in India</h2>
  <p>India is a democratic country and has a long-standing tradition of protecting human rights. However, in recent years, there have been several instances of human rights violations in India. For example, the Citizenship Amendment Act 2019 (CAA), which is viewed by many as discriminatory against Muslims. The CAA is a law that grants citizenship to minorities from Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, but does not include Muslims. This has led to widespread protests in India and criticism from the international community.</p>
  <p>In addition, the Indian government has been accused of suppressing dissent and cracking down on freedom of expression. Journalists, activists, and academics have been arrested or harassed for their work. Many Kashmiri politicians remain in detention after the government revoked the region's autonomy in August 2019.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>The following are some case studies which highlight the current situation of human rights violations in India:</p>
  <h3>The Citizenship Amendment Act</h3>
  <p>The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) passed by the Indian parliament in 2019 amended the citizenship law and granted citizenship rights to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian refugees from neighbouring Islamic countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh. However, this law does not include Muslims, leading to protests and a backlash from Indian citizens and the international community.</p>
  <p>According to Amnesty International India, the passage of the CAA has led to massive protests across the country. The police have used excessive force to quell the protests, resulting in deaths and injuries. Several journalists have been arrested or detained for their coverage of the protests.</p>
  <h3>The Revocation of Article 370 in Kashmir</h3>
  <p>In August 2019, the Indian government revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir (J&amp;K) under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution. This move was seen as an infringement of the rights of the people of J&amp;K and led to widespread protests and a communications blackout in the region. Thousands of people, including political leaders and human rights defenders, were detained without trial for several months.</p>
  <p>According to the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the Indian government's decision to revoke Article 370 of the constitution triggered the detention of leaders of the Kashmiri separatist movement, restrictions on freedom of movement and assembly, and the suppression of freedom of expression.</p>
  <h2>Joe Biden's Message to India</h2>
  <p>During his recent visit to India, Joe Biden spoke about the importance of strengthening the partnership between India and the United States and promoting democracy and human rights. Biden urged Prime Minister Modi to uphold democratic and pluralistic values and to address human rights concerns in India.</p>
  <p>Biden's message was welcomed by many human rights activists around the world, who have been calling for the Indian government to address these concerns for several years. However, some people argue that Biden's message was too diplomatic and did not go far enough in addressing the scale of human rights abuses in India.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion in Three Points</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, the promotion of human rights should be a key component of foreign policy and diplomacy. The protection of human rights is a global concern and an essential component of peace, stability, and security in the world. Here are three key takeaways from this article:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The Indian government has been accused of human rights violations such as the Citizenship Amendment Act and the revocation of Article 370 in Kashmir.</li>
   <li>The protection of human rights is a global concern and should be promoted as a key component of foreign policy and diplomacy.</li>
   <li>Joe Biden's message to India has highlighted the importance of addressing human rights concerns and upholding democratic and pluralistic values.</li>
