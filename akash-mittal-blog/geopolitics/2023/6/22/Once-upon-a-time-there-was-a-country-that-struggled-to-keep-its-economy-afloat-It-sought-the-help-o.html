  <p></p>
  <p>Pakistan, facing a severe economic crisis, has been in talks with the IMF for a $6 billion bailout package since November 2018. However, after several meetings between the two parties, little progress has been made. This has led Pakistan to activate its alternate plan, also known as Plan-B.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Plan-B focuses on seeking loans and financial support from other countries and organizations. This includes China, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The country has already received financial support from these countries, but it is unclear whether this would be enough to tackle its economic challenges.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One of the major challenges faced by Pakistan is its burgeoning debt. The country's debt has risen to $105 billion, which is around 30 percent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This has put a lot of pressure on its economy, making it difficult for the country to meet its financial obligations.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>To tackle this, the government has introduced a number of measures such as cutting down the budget deficit, increasing taxes, and curtailing imports. However, these measures have not been enough to bring about the desired results.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One of the reasons why Pakistan has been unsuccessful in striking a deal with the IMF is its reluctance to implement structural reforms. The IMF has been pushing for reforms in the taxation system, energy sector, and public enterprises. However, Pakistan is finding it difficult to implement these reforms, which are seen as politically unpopular.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>A classic example of how structural reforms can help a country is provided by Argentina. In 2018, the country was in a similar situation as Pakistan. Its economy was in shambles, its currency was depreciating rapidly, and its debt was skyrocketing. However, with the help of IMF, Argentina implemented a set of structural reforms that helped stabilize its economy.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One of the key reforms implemented was the removal of subsidies on energy and transportation. This helped reduce the budget deficit and increase government revenue. Another important reform was the introduction of a flexible exchange rate system, which helped stabilize the currency.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The reforms implemented by Argentina showed that with political will, even a country in dire straits can bring about a change in its fortunes. However, the challenge lies in gaining the support of the public, which is likely to resist any measures that would impact their lives negatively.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, Pakistan activating its Plan-B is a clear indication of how difficult it has been for the country to reach an agreement with IMF. While seeking financial support from other countries is a step in the right direction, it is not enough to bring about sustained growth and development. Structural reforms may be the only way for Pakistan to tackle its economic challenges, but implementing these reforms would require political will and public support.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Three key takeaways from this article are:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. IMF negotiations can be difficult, but seeking a bailout from other sources may not be enough to solve an economic crisis.</p>
  <p>2. Implementing structural reforms is key to stabilizing an economy, but this requires political will and public support.</p>
  <p>3. Argentina provides a good example of how these reforms can help a country in dire straits.</p>
