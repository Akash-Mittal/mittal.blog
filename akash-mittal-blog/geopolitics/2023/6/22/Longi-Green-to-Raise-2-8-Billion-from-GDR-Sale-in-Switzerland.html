   <p>Longi Green is already the world's biggest solar silicon wafer maker. However, the company's ambitions do not stop there. Recently, Longi has announced that it plans to raise up to $2.8 billion from a GDR sale in Switzerland. This move comes as the company seeks new funding sources to expand its operations and cement its position as a global leader in the renewable energy industry.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Longi's Impact</h2>
   <p>Longi Green has built a formidable reputation in the renewable energy sector. The company has been instrumental in accelerating the adoption of solar energy globally. Since its establishment in 2000, the company has consistently pushed the boundaries of solar technology. For example, in 2017, Longi broke the world record for mono PERC solar cell efficiency, which exceeded 24% for the first time. This breakthrough led to tremendous growth in the company's sales, as it cemented Longi's position as an industry leader.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <p>A case in point of Longi's impact is the 500-megawatt (MW) state-of-the-art solar facility in China's Ningxia province. In 2020, Longi signed a deal with China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) to supply the facility with monocrystalline solar modules. This move has allowed the facility to generate efficient and affordable solar power, which ultimately helped China achieve its goal of transitioning to cleaner sources of energy. Similarly, in Europe, Longi has attracted major investments in Germany and Spain, further indicating the company's strong position in the global renewable energy market.</p>
