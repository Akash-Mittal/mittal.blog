    <p>Once upon a time, there was a young boy who loved to draw. His sketches were the talk of the town and people came from far and wide to see his work. His family beamed with pride and encouraged him to pursue his talent. As he grew up, he realized that his passion was not just a hobby but a potential career path. However, his family had already set a high expectation of him becoming a world-renowned artist.</p>
    <p>The boy felt the weight of his family's expectation and started feeling the pressure to succeed. He constantly compared himself with other artists and in his quest to live up to his family's expectations, he lost his love for art.</p>
    <p>This story is not uncommon in our society. We put a lot of pressure on ourselves and on others to achieve certain expectations. Whether it's the expectation of getting good grades, landing a high-paying job, getting married at a certain age, having children, or achieving success in a particular field, these expectations can become heavy baggage that we carry with us throughout our lives.</p>
    <p>How does this baggage impact our lives? Let's explore some examples.</p>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>Expectations can lead to:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Anxiety and stress</li>
     <li>Low self-esteem</li>
     <li>Depression and suicidal thoughts</li>
     <li>Perfectionism</li>
     <li>Feeling of failure</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let's take the example of a student who has been raised with the expectation of excelling in academics. They may feel intense pressure to get straight As, not just to make their parents proud, but also to gain acceptance and recognition from their peers. This pressure can lead to anxiety, sleepless nights, and even physical symptoms like headaches and stomach aches. In some cases, it can also lead to cheating to maintain high grades.</p>
    <p>Similarly, the expectation of getting a high-paying job can make individuals choose a career they don't enjoy or take on a job they are not passionate about, leading to dissatisfaction and burnout.</p>
    <p>Expectations can also impact relationships. For instance, the pressure to get married at a certain age can lead to hasty decisions and entering into relationships that are not healthy or fulfilling.</p>

    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>Let's take a look at some real-life case studies:</p>
    <h3>Case Study 1:</h3>
    <p>Chandran is a 35-year old man who grew up in a family of doctors. His parents had always wanted him to become a doctor and he too aspired to follow in their footsteps. However, after failing his entrance examination twice, he gave up on his dream, feeling like a failure and lacking direction in life. It was only after he took vocational guidance that he realized his true passion lay in filmmaking.</p>
    <h3>Case Study 2:</h3>
    <p>Shruti is a 28-year old woman who was raised in a family where marriage was considered a priority. She was constantly reminded that she had to get married by the age of 25, or else, she would become an old maiden. However, Shruti wanted to focus on her career and travel before settling down. She felt pressured and got into a relationship with a man who she did not feel strongly for, but thought was a safe bet. They got married but the marriage was unhappy and ended in a divorce.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Expectations are a part of life, but they should not control us. The baggage of expectations can be burdensome and lead to disappointment, stress, and a lack of fulfillment in life. Hence, it is important to:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Recognize and manage our own expectations</li>
     <li>Respect the individuality and choices of others</li>
     <li>Celebrate progress and small wins, rather than focusing solely on the end-goal</li>
    </ol>
