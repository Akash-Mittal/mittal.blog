  <p></p>
  <p>One possible explanation is the growing strategic importance of India in global politics. With China rising as a formidable rival, the United States sees India as a potential ally in containing its influence. This has led to a trend of "decoupling" between the US and China, where American businesses are encouraged to move their supply chains from China to India. In this context, America cannot afford to alienate India's leader, no matter how controversial he may be.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>However, this approach raises moral and ethical concerns. Should the United States overlook human rights abuses in favor of realpolitik? Should business interests trump human rights? In this article, we will explore these issues and their implications.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One of the key areas of concern when it comes to human rights abuses in India is the situation in Kashmir. Since Modi's government revoked the region's autonomy in 2019, there have been widespread reports of human rights violations by security forces. These include extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detentions, torture, and rape. In addition, there are concerns about the suppression of free speech and the use of draconian laws to target critics of the government.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another area of concern is the treatment of religious minorities in India. Modi's government has been accused of promoting a Hindu nationalist agenda that discriminates against Muslims and other minorities. This includes the passage of a controversial citizenship law that excludes Muslims, as well as the demolition of a mosque in Ayodhya that was seen as a symbol of communal harmony.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case Studies:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One prominent case that illustrates the human rights situation in India is the detention of human rights activist Stan Swamy. Swamy, an 84-year-old Jesuit priest, was arrested in 2020 under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), a broad anti-terrorism law that has been criticized for its misuse. Swamy was accused of links to Maoist rebels and held in jail for several months without bail. Despite suffering from Parkinson's disease and other health issues, he was denied bail repeatedly and died in custody in July 2021. His case has been widely condemned as a violation of human rights and an abuse of the UAPA.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another case that highlights the religious discrimination in India is that of Tabrez Ansari. Ansari, a Muslim man, was accused of stealing a motorcycle in Jharkhand state in 2019. He was beaten up by a mob and forced to chant Hindu slogans. He died four days later from injuries sustained in the attack. While some of the attackers were arrested, the incident sparked outrage over the rise of vigilante justice and communal tensions in India.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In light of these concerns, it is clear that the US-India relationship cannot be based solely on strategic interests. Human rights and democracy must also be part of the equation. Therefore, we recommend the following three points:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. The Biden administration should raise human rights concerns with Modi's government at every opportunity. This should include specific cases of abuses, as well as broader issues such as the need for press freedom and protection of minorities.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. American businesses should also be held accountable for their actions in India. They should be required to uphold ethical and human rights standards in their operations, and take steps to address any violations.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. The US should work with other democratic nations to promote human rights and democracy globally. This includes supporting civil society organizations and activists who are working to uphold these values, as well as advocating for international norms and laws that protect human rights.</p>
