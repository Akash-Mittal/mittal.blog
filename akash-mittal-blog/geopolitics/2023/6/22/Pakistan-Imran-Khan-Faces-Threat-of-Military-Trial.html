  <h1>Pakistan: Imran Khan Faces Threat of Military Trial</h1></br> <img src="images/Pakistan-Imran-Khan-Faces-Threat-of-Military-Trial.jpeg" alt="+Pakistan-Imran-Khan-Faces-Threat-of-Military-Trial+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/06/20/pakistan-imran-khan-military-trials-protests-pti-elections/" target="_blank" href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/06/20/pakistan-imran-khan-military-trials-protests-pti-elections/" rel="noopener">https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/06/20/pakistan-imran-khan-military-trials-protests-pti-elections/</a></span></h5>
  <p>Once, there was a boy named Imran Khan in Pakistan. He wanted to become a cricketer but his parents did not support him. They wanted him to become a doctor or an engineer. However, Imran did not give up his dream and worked hard to become one of the best cricketers in the world. He led the Pakistan team to win the 1992 Cricket World Cup and became a national hero.</p>
  <p>After retiring from cricket, Imran Khan became a politician and founded the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party in 1996. He promised to fight corruption, improve the economy, and bring justice to the people of Pakistan. He campaigned tirelessly for years and finally won the 2018 general elections to become the Prime Minister of Pakistan.</p>
  <p>However, Imran Khan's rise to power has not been smooth. The Pakistani military, which has ruled the country for half of its existence, has always been suspicious of civilian leaders and has a history of launching coups against them. Imran Khan's government has often clashed with the military over various issues, including the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy, and foreign policy.</p>
  <p>Recently, Imran Khan and his government have faced a new threat from the military. The Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), which is Pakistan's premier spy agency and a part of the military, has reportedly launched an investigation into the alleged rigging of the 2018 elections that brought Imran Khan to power. The ISI has also summoned several top politicians, including the former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, to appear before it in the coming weeks to answer questions about their alleged involvement in the rigging.</p>
  <p>The opposition parties have accused the military of trying to undermine democracy in Pakistan and have vowed to resist any attempt to interfere in the political process. They have also criticized Imran Khan for not standing up to the military and for being a puppet of the army.</p>
  <h2>Examples and Case Studies</h2>
  <p>The threat of a military trial is not new to Pakistan. In the past, several civilian leaders, including Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Benazir Bhutto, and Nawaz Sharif, have been ousted or jailed by the military on charges of corruption or other offences. The military has also been accused of human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings, torture, and enforced disappearances.</p>
  <p>In 2007, General Pervez Musharraf, who was then the President of Pakistan, declared a state of emergency and suspended the constitution. He arrested thousands of lawyers, judges, and political activists and imposed strict censorship on the media. This move was widely criticized by the international community and led to a popular movement for the restoration of democracy in Pakistan.</p>
  <p>Another example is the case of Dr. Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani neuroscientist who was accused of terrorism and brought to the United States to stand trial. Her case became a cause célèbre in Pakistan and sparked protests across the country. Many Pakistanis believe that she was falsely accused and that she is a victim of the war on terror.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, the threat of a military trial for Imran Khan and other politicians in Pakistan is a worrying development that could undermine the country's fragile democracy. The military's interference in politics, whether overt or covert, has always been a major impediment to the country's progress and stability. To prevent a return to military rule, the Pakistani government, civil society, and the international community must work together to protect the democratic process and to hold accountable those who violate it.</p>
