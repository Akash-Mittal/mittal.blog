    <h2>Examples of India-US Partnership</h2>
    <p>The India-US relationship has come a long way since the Cold War era, when the two nations shared a strained relationship. Today, the partnership between the world's largest democracies spans across various sectors, including defense, economy, technology, and culture.</p>
    <h3>Defense</h3>
    <p>India and the US have collaborated on several defense projects, including joint military exercises, defense technology transfers, and intelligence sharing. The two nations have also signed several defense agreements, including the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA), Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA), and Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA). These agreements provide a framework for enhanced defense cooperation between India and the US.</p>
    <h3>Economy</h3>
    <p>The economic partnership between India and the US has strengthened over the years, with bilateral trade reaching $149 billion in 2019. The two nations have also entered into a number of trade agreements, including the US-India Strategic Trade Authorization (STA) agreement, which allows for the transfer of high-tech products between the two countries. The US is also one of the largest investors in India, with investments in various sectors, including technology, healthcare, and energy.</p>
    <h3>Technology</h3>
    <p>The India-US partnership in the technology sector has been particularly significant, with the two nations collaborating on several projects, including space exploration, renewable energy, and cybersecurity. The US has also been a key partner in India's Digital India initiative, which aims to create a digitally empowered society and economy.</p>
    <h3>Culture</h3>
    <p>The cultural exchange between India and the US has been vibrant, with the two nations sharing a rich history and heritage. Indian music, dance, and cinema have all found a global audience in the US, and vice versa. The two nations have also collaborated on several initiatives to promote cultural exchange, including the Fulbright-Nehru program, which provides scholarships for Indian students to study in the US.</p>
