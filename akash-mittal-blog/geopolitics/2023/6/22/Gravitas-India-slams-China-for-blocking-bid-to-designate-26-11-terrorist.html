  <h1>An Act of Terrorism</h1></br> <img src="images/Gravitas-India-slams-China-for-blocking-bid-to-designate-26-11-terrorist.jpeg" alt="+Gravitas-India-slams-China-for-blocking-bid-to-designate-26-11-terrorist+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc_aqIDvOrg" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc_aqIDvOrg" rel="noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc_aqIDvOrg</a></span></h5>
  <p>On the 26th of November 2008, the city of Mumbai was shaken by a series of terrorist attacks that lasted for four days. The nature of the attacks was brutal and the impact was devastating. 166 people lost their lives and over 300 were injured in what is considered to be one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in India.</p>
  <h2>India's Response</h2>
  <p>In response to the attacks, India has been pushing for the designation of the mastermind behind the attacks, Hafiz Saeed, as a global terrorist. India's efforts have been supported by the international community and the UN Security Council's Resolution 1267, which outlines the procedures for designating individuals and entities associated with Al-Qaeda, Taliban, and ISIS as global terrorists.</p>
  <h2>China's Veto</h2>
  <p>Despite overwhelming evidence of Saeed's involvement in the Mumbai attacks, China has blocked India's bid to designate him as a global terrorist. China's move has been widely criticized by the international community, including the United States, which has urged China to reconsider its position.</p>
  <h2>Examples of China's Support to Terrorism</h2>
  <p>China's move to block India's bid to designate Saeed as a global terrorist is not an isolated incident. China has a long-standing history of supporting terrorist organizations and backing state-sponsors of terrorism. Here are a few examples:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>China has been supplying arms and ammunition to Pakistan, which has been accused of sponsoring terrorists.</li>
   <li>China is a close ally of North Korea, which has been accused of supporting terrorist organizations.</li>
   <li>China has been supporting the Taliban in Afghanistan, which is classified as a terrorist organization by the UN Security Council.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>China's support to terrorism has not only impacted India but has also had severe consequences for other countries. Here are some case studies:</p>
  <h3>The United States</h3>
  <p>China has been accused of providing a safe haven for the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), which operates in Xinjiang, a region in China's northwest. The ETIM has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States and has been linked to several acts of terrorism in China. Despite this, China has maintained that its actions in Xinjiang are part of its efforts to crack down on terrorism and separatism.</p>
  <h3>Pakistan</h3>
  <p>China's support to Pakistan has emboldened the country to continue its support for terrorism. Pakistan has been accused of supporting terrorist groups such as the Lashkar-e-Taiba, which is responsible for the Mumbai attacks. Despite overwhelming evidence of Pakistan's role in supporting terrorism, China has continued to support Pakistan's position on the issue.</p>
  <h3>India</h3>
  <p>India has been the most impacted by China's support to terrorism. Apart from blocking India's bid to designate Hafiz Saeed as a global terrorist, China has also been supporting Pakistan's position on the issue of Kashmir. Pakistan has been accused of supporting separatist groups in Kashmir, which have been responsible for several acts of terrorism in India.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The impact of terrorism is not restricted to a single country or region. China's support to terrorism has had severe consequences for countries such as the United States, Pakistan, and India. Designating individuals and entities associated with terrorism as global terrorists is an essential step in the fight against terrorism. The international community needs to come together to put pressure on countries that support terrorism, such as China, to change their position and take action against terrorists.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The international community must work together to counter China's support to terrorism.</li>
   <li>The UN Security Council must take action against countries that support terrorism.</li>
   <li>The designation of individuals and entities associated with terrorism as global terrorists must be made a priority.</li>
