   <p>India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, visited the United States in September 2021 to hold in-person meetings with U.S. President Joe Biden. While the main focus of Modi's visit was to strengthen the bilateral relationship between India and the United States, his visit also sent a big, if quiet, signal to China.</p>
   <h2>Examples</h2>
   <p>Modi's visit demonstrated India's growing strategic alliance with the United States and its commitment to countering China's influence in the region. During the visit, Modi and Biden announced several initiatives to bolster India's defense capabilities and promote technology transfer. The United States also recognized India as a "major defense partner," which allows India to purchase more advanced military technology from the United States.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, Modi's visit signaled India's eagerness to participate in the Quad, an informal strategic alliance between the United States, Japan, Australia, and India. The Quad aims to counter China's rising influence in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <p>The recent border disputes between India and China in the Galwan Valley and the Ladakh region have intensified India's concerns about China's aggressive behavior in the region. Modi's visit to the United States can be seen as a direct response to China's increasing assertiveness in the region. The United States has been vocal about its support for India's territorial integrity and has condemned China's aggression along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).</p>
   <p>Moreover, Modi's visit can also be viewed in the context of the ongoing economic rivalry between India and China. The United States has been looking to diversify its supply chains and reduce its dependence on China. India, with its large and growing market, skilled workforce, and emphasis on self-reliance, offers a viable alternative to China as a manufacturing hub.</p>
