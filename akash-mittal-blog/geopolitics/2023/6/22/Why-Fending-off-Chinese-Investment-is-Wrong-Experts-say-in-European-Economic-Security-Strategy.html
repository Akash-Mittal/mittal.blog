  <p>Investing in the right place and at the right time can make you a fortune - and history is filled with such examples of mega-successful investments. However, sometimes, people tend to shift their attention away from what's productive and profitable and instead try to protect what they already have. That's when things start to take an interesting turn.</p>
  <p>Take, for instance, the story of a small town businessman who started a small firm manufacturing umbrellas. The firm was doing well, and he had customers all over his country. However, he became incredibly protective and refused investments from foreign investors, especially from China, citing reasons like interest rates, export control regulations, and most importantly, the assumption that wave after wave of Chinese investment would create a monopoly in the market. After years of sheer reliance on domestic funds, he ended up going out of business, as he failed to compete with rivals who had availed foreign investments and expanded their businesses abroad.</p>
  <p>This cautionary tale holds as much truth today in the world's economic war-zone. In late 2018, the European Union issued a paper on what called "economic security," which, in turn, rang the alarm bells on approving Chinese investments, with fear of appropriation of crucial technologies, strategic infrastructure, and market shares. The EU also added that the need to screen Chinese investments has become even more apparent in the light of the Chinese Belt and Road initiative and "Made in China 2025" program, which aims to make China a leader in ten strategic sectors.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Chinese Investments that have benefitted Europe</h2>
  <p>Despite the EU's view, experts have suggested that limiting Chinese investments could lead to a loss of potential opportunities and benefits for Europe. Here are some examples, according to <a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1184500.shtml">Global Times</a> that show how Chinese investment has benefitted Europe:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>China's Three Gorges Corporation invested 9 billion euros in the Portuguese power grid, which made it possible to modernize the grid and reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels.</li>
   <li>The Aviation Industry Corporation of China invested in Italian aero-engine producer Avio, which enabled Avio to expand internationally and to recover quickly from an Olympic failure.</li>
   <li>China has also invested in several internationally well-known brands such as Pirelli, Ferretti, and Weetabix via Fosun Group.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Case Studies on the Benefits of Chinese Investments</h2>
  <p>Here are some case studies that show the benefits of Chinese investments in Europe:</p>
  <h3>China General Nuclear Power Group in Romania's Energy Sector</h3>
  <p>China's General Nuclear Power Group is investing 7.7 billion euros ($9bn) in two new nuclear reactors in Romania's energy sector. It has promised to build them by 2030 and has already invested over 1 billion euros ($1.17bn) in designing the reactors and obtaining approvals. The investment, which is one of the EU's most significant energy projects, is expected to boost Romania's infrastructure development, create jobs and attract new projects.</p>
  <h3>Chinese Investment in Greece's Piraeus Port</h3>
  <p>China's Cosco Shipping took a 51% stake in the Piraeus Port Authority in Greece in 2016, extending China's reach into Europe and the Mediterranean. Since then, several large Chinese companies and delegations have visited the Piraeus port to explore opportunities in trade, manufacturing, and logistics. The port's throughput has grown from 880,000 TEUs in 2010 to 5,650,000 in 2019, making it one of the largest ports in Europe.</p>
  <h3>The benefits of investing in Innovation in Europe</h3>

Additionally, China is also Becoming a mainstream partner for Research and Development models between Europe and China for several industries.</p>
  <h2>In conclusion, it is essential to note three significant points:</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>Chinese investments have proved to be a boon for European economies, creating opportunities, and boosting infrastructure.</li>
   <li>Limiting foreign investments in critical sectors like technology and strategic infrastructure may cause more harm than good and could perhaps, stagnate the economy.</li>
   <li>While it is important to screen any foreign investments to identify possible risks and how to mitigate them, rejection without proper reasoning is wrong and may lead to missed opportunities and sustainable growth.</li>
