  <p>In 2014, Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister of India after sweeping election victory. Since then, he has been working tirelessly to improve India's economic and political standing on the global stage. Fast forward to 2021, and Joe Biden has become the President of the United States, bringing a new set of opportunities for India to strengthen its position as a key player in the international community.</p>
  <h2>Examples of India's Allegiance</h2>
  <p>India's allegiance has always been a matter of interest for countries around the world, given its strategic location, increasing economic might and vast population. Its relationship with China has been strained over the years, particularly due to border tensions, trade disputes, and China's growing influence in the region. Similarly, India's ties with Russia have been long-standing, however, the recent rapprochement between Russia and China has put India in a dilemma.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>Recently, India has been actively seeking to deepen its ties with the US, particularly in terms of defense and security. In 2019, the US and India signed the COMCASA agreement, which enables the sharing of military technology and intelligence. This agreement was followed by the U.S. Department of Defense's decision to elevate India's status to that of a 'major defense partner', which paves the way for increased collaboration in areas such as co-production and joint research and development.</p>
  <p>Another important development has been India's participation in the Quad, a strategic alliance among India, Australia, Japan, and the US, which seeks to counterbalance China's growing regional influence.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion: A Golden Opportunity for India</h2>
  <p>The Biden administration's focus on strengthening partnerships and alliances presents a golden opportunity for India to deepen its relationship with the US and emerge as a key player on the global stage. India should leverage this opportunity by enhancing its economic partnership, collaborating on technological advancements, and bolstering its defense capabilities. By doing so, India can regain and reinforce its strategic importance in the region and around the world.</p>
