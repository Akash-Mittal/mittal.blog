    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>Incidents like these are not new in football. In the 2006 World Cup match between Portugal and the Netherlands, 16 yellow cards and 4 red cards were given, making it the most booked match in the history of the World Cup. Similarly, during the 2013 Confederations Cup semi-final between Brazil and Uruguay, Luis Suarez, the Uruguayan striker, bit the shoulder of Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini, which led to a lengthy ban for Suarez.</p>

    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>The scuffle during the India vs Pakistan match in SAFF Championship is a classic example of how emotions can take over sportsmanship.

    <p>However, the incident did not end on the field. It spilled over to social media, with fans from both countries hurling abuses and threatening each other. The media also picked up the story, and it became a headline, overshadowing the actual game.</p>
