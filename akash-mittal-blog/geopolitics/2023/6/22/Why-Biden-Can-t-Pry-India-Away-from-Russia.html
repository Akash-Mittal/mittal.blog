   <p>India has been a major player in global politics and foreign affairs for decades. Its strategic partnership with Russia has been a central aspect of its foreign policy. Despite efforts by the United States to develop a closer relationship with India, it appears that President Biden will not be successful in prying India away from Russia anytime soon.</p>
   <h2>A Story of India and Russia's Relationship</h2>
   <p>The relationship between India and Russia dates back to the Soviet era when India was a non-aligned country struggling with economic and political instability. In the 1970s, Moscow provided India with military aid during its conflict with Pakistan.</p>
   <p>Since then, the two countries have developed a close relationship that goes beyond geopolitics. From joint military exercises to the construction of power plants, India and Russia have laid a foundation for a long-term partnership. India also purchases a significant amount of its military hardware from Russia, including the Sukhoi Su-30 fighter jets.</p>
   <h2>The United States' Efforts</h2>
   <p>The United States has made several attempts to develop a closer relationship with India. The Obama administration designated India as a "major defense partner" in 2016, to facilitate the transfer of advanced military technology and extend the defense collaboration between the two countries. However, despite this effort, India has not veered away from Russia.</p>
   <p>In 2019, then-President Trump revoked India's preferential treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program, which exempted certain Indian exports from US tariffs, citing India's trade policies as the reason behind the decision. This led to a diplomatic rift between the two countries that further complicated their relationship.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <p>India's continued partnership with Russia despite US pressure can be seen in the following case studies:</p>
   <h3>India-Soviet Union Treaty of Friendship</h3>
   <p>The India-Soviet Union Treaty of Friendship signed in 1971 is a testament to the long-standing relationship between the two countries. The Treaty pledges mutual assistance and cooperation in political, economic, and military spheres. The treaty has been renewed several times, and its last extension was signed in 2019, despite the increasing pressure from the United States.</p>
   <h3>The S-400 Missile System Deal</h3>
   <p>The S-400 missile deal between India and Russia is another demonstration of their partnership. The US administration had warned that India's purchase of the S-400 missile system would jeopardize its relationship with the United States. However, India has continued with the deal, indicating that its relationship with Russia is more important than its ties with the United States.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>India's relationship with Russia is deeply ingrained in its foreign policy. The United States' attempts to develop a closer relationship with India have not yielded the desired results. India's partnership with Russia has withstood the test of time, through different governments and changing geopolitical landscapes. It is a reflection of the mutual trust, respect, and shared interests between the two countries.</p>
   <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
   <p>In conclusion, India is likely to maintain its strategic partnership with Russia despite the United States' efforts to develop closer economic and military ties. Any effort by the United States to pry India away from Russia will have to take into consideration India's long-term interests, its history, and its strategic goals.</p>
