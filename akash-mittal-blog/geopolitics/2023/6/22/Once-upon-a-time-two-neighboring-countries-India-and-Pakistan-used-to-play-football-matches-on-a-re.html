  <p></p>
  <p>India and Pakistan have played 32 official football matches against each other, with India winning 10, while Pakistan winning 12, and 10 matches resulting in a draw. Both teams have scored a total of 56 goals each in these matches. The first-ever India-Pakistan football match was played in 1952, where India beat Pakistan 1-0. However, in the last few years, Pakistan hasn't been able to compete at the same level as India in football.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One of the most memorable matches between the two countries was the SAFF Championship final in 2011. India was the defending champion, while Pakistan had reached the final for the first time in the history of the tournament. The match was held in Delhi, India, and was witnessed by a capacity crowd at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium. India won the match 4-0, with all the four goals scored in the second half. Sunil Chhetri, the Indian striker, scored twice in the match and created a record of being the first-ever Indian to score in three SAFF Championship finals.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>India's rising football stature can be attributed to the emergence of the Indian Super League (ISL), which started in 2014. The league has attracted some of the best foreign and domestic players, and the increased focus on football infrastructure and development has also helped Indian football. The success of the ISL has inspired many young footballers in India to pursue the sport professionally, which has resulted in an increase in the quality of domestic football. This has reflected in India's performances in international tournaments as well.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>On the other hand, Pakistan's football scene has been plagued by administrative and financial issues, which have hampered the growth of the sport. The team hasn't played many matches in recent years and is currently ranked 200th in the FIFA World Rankings, while India is ranked 105th. Pakistan has previously shown that they can compete with the best, as they reached the semi-finals of the AFC Challenge Cup in 2014, where they lost to Palestine. However, the lack of support and interest in the sport has led to a decline in the quality of football in Pakistan.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The India-Pakistan football rivalry is a unique one, as it brings together two nations that are often at odds with each other. The football matches between the two countries provide a platform for both nations to come together and celebrate the sport. Despite the political and social tensions between India and Pakistan, football has always been a unifying force for the people of both nations.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, the head-to-head record between India and Pakistan in football may be closely contested, but the recent performances of both teams have been different. India has been on the rise in international football, while Pakistan has struggled to maintain its footballing infrastructure. However, the India-Pakistan football rivalry is more than just about the results; it's about the passion and enthusiasm of the fans who wait eagerly for this clash. As both nations prepare for the SAFF Championship, football fans around the world eagerly look forward to this match.</p>
