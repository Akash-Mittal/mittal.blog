  <p>Imagine two friends, Sam and Joe. Sam has been best friends with Joe since they were kids, but recently they had a falling out and are no longer talking to each other. In an attempt to replace Joe, Sam tries to become friends with a new person, Tom. But no matter how much Sam tries, he realizes that Tom cannot replace Joe.</p>
  <p>Similarly, India's current economic ties with the US cannot replace the trade that it has with China. Economic ties between countries are complex, and while India and the US have been strengthening their economic relationship over the years, it cannot fully replace or compete with the economic relationship that India has with China.</p>
  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p>Let's take a look at some examples to understand why this is the case:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>In 2020, India's total trade with China was worth $87 billion, while its trade with the US was $87.9 billion, with China being India's largest trading partner.</li>
   <li>In 2021, Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi announced that it would invest $10 billion in India over the next decade to increase manufacturing and establish a research and development hub in the country. This shows that Chinese businesses still see India as an important market and are willing to invest in it.</li>
   <li>India's textile and apparel industry, which is a major contributor to its economy, heavily relies on China for raw materials such as cotton. While India has been trying to reduce its dependence on China by exploring alternative markets, it is unlikely that it will be able to completely replace China as a supplier in the near future.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <div class="case-study">
   <p>Case Study 1: Chinese Investments in India</p>
   <ul>
    <li>In 2019, India and China had a border standoff that resulted in a heightened sense of nationalism in India. As a result, many Indian citizens and businesses called for a boycott of Chinese products and investments in India. However, the Indian government did not take any major actions against Chinese investments in the country, and in fact, continued to welcome them. This shows that the Indian government values its economic partnership with China over the sentiments of its citizens.</li>
   </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="case-study">
   <p>Case Study 2: US-India Trade Relations</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The US has been trying to increase its trade relations with India for a long time, and in 2019, the two countries signed a trade deal with the aim of increasing their trade to $500 billion. However, the deal has not been implemented yet, and there are several issues that need to be resolved before it can be implemented, such as India's market access, intellectual property rights, and data localization policies. This shows that while both countries have a willingness to strengthen their economic ties, there are still several challenges that need to be overcome.</li>
   </ul>
  </div>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <div class="conclusion">
   <p>The implications of India's economic ties with the US not being able to replace its trade with China are:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>India will continue to rely heavily on China for its raw materials, which could make it vulnerable to supply chain disruptions.</li>
    <li>India's textile and apparel industry may struggle to find alternative suppliers if it tries to reduce its dependence on China.</li>
    <li>While India and the US may be strengthening their economic ties, it will take time and effort to replace the economic relationship that India has with China.</li>
