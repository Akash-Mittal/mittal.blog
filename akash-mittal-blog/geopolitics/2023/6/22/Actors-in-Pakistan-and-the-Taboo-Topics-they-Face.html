   <p>Ayesha Omar, a famous Pakistani actress, has recently spoken out about the risks actors face when they bring up taboo topics in the industry. She revealed that many actors have lost work due to taking a stand on certain sensitive issues, which has a chilling effect on free speech.</p>
   
   <p>Recently, Pakistani model and actress Myra Khan faced a lot of backlash on social media for her decision to work in a Web series which touched upon the topic of Karbala. The series was quite controversial as it depicted the Muharram rituals in an unconventional way, which did not sit well with some viewers. Those who were against the portrayal threatened to boycott Myra Khan if she went ahead with the project, which put her in a tough spot.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Taboo Topics</h2>
   <p>Ayesha Omar mentions that the topics which are considered taboo in Pakistan include anything related to sex, homosexuality, mental health, politics and religion. Even if these topics are brought up in a subtle way, there is still a risk of being marginalized or blacklisted by the industry.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies of Actors</h2>
   <p>Many actors have faced the consequences of being too vocal on taboo topics. One such example is Nadia Jamil, an actress who spoke openly about her struggle with depression. After her public confession, she was seen less on screen and received a lot of hate on social media. Similarly, famous comedian Umer Sharif faced criticism and pushback when he commented on the recent political climate in Pakistan.</p>
