  <p>Once upon a time, Saudi Arabia and Iran were considered as allies in the Middle East. However, the friendship turned into rivalry which further intensified and became a regional cold war. This cold war has impacted the entire West Asian region, and its effects can be seen in the current geopolitical landscape.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Saudia Arabia-Iran Rivalries</h2>
  <p>Saudi Arabia and Iran have been at loggerheads for various reasons. One of the most significant reasons is Sunni-Shia tensions resulting from their differing interpretations of Islam. Additionally, the two countries have political and economic differences as well, with oil playing a significant role. For instance, Saudi Arabia has historically been the leading producer of oil, and Iran is the fourth-largest producer. They both seek to control oil prices and markets, leading to a severe rivalry. Furthermore, geopolitical power struggles influence their relationships, as Iran seeks to become a regional power while Saudi Arabia seeks to maintain its dominant power position.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <h3>Yemen Civil War</h3>
  <p>The ongoing civil war in Yemen is one of the significant results of the Saudi Arabia-Iran rivalry. The war began in 2014 when the Houthi rebels took control of several regions, including the capital, Sanaa. Saudi Arabia, fearing Iran's influence in Yemen following the Houthi's takeover, intervened by forming a coalition in 2015 with the intention of crushing the rebels. Iran, on the other hand, provided financial and military aid to the Houthis, leading to a full-blown war. Yemen is facing one of the world's most significant humanitarian crises, with millions displaced and thousands dead.</p>
  <h3>Lebanese Political Crisis</h3>
  <p>Lebanon's political crisis began when the Prime Minister, Saad Hariri, resigned in 2017 from his position following Iran's increasing influence in the country. Saudi Arabia saw Hariri's resignation as a win over Iran and supported him. Iran, on the other hand, helped strengthen Lebanese militant political groups like Hezbollah, which deepened the crisis further. This rivalry has impacted stability and economic growth in the country, leading to widespread protests.</p>
