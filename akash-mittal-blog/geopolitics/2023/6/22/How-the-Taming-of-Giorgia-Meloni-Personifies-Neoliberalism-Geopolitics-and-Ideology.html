  <p>Once a fiery nationalist politician known for her anti-immigration and anti-European Union stance, Giorgia Meloni has undergone a dramatic political transformation in recent years.</p>
  <p>Once an outcast within the conservative political bloc, Meloni's party–which she now leads–has emerged as a major political force in Italy, currently polling at around 20% in national elections.</p>
  <p>So what caused this transformation?</p>
  <h2>The Influence of Neoliberalism</h2>
  <p>Neoliberalism, the economic doctrine that champions free market capitalism and a small government, has played a major role in shaping Meloni's new political stance.</p>
  <p>Meloni's party, the Brothers of Italy, has embraced neoliberal policies that promote deregulation, privatization, and free trade. This has allowed the party to forge alliances with business interests, both domestically and abroad, and to appeal to urban voters who value economic growth over traditional conservative values.</p>
  <p>For example, Meloni's party has supported the privatization of state-owned assets, including energy companies and public services. It has also pushed for greater freedom for businesses to operate in Italy, including reduced taxes and regulations.</p>
  <h2>The Influence of Geopolitics</h2>
  <p>Geopolitics, or the study of the intersection of geography and politics, has also played a role in Meloni's political evolution.</p>
  <p>As Italy has increased its role in global affairs, particularly in relation to the United States and Russia, Meloni has shifted her focus from purely domestic issues to more geopolitical concerns.</p>
  <p>For example, Meloni has supported closer ties with Russia, arguing that Italy should form a strategic partnership with Moscow to counterbalance U.S. influence in Europe. She has also advocated for a tougher stance on immigration, arguing that Italy's open borders policy is a threat to national security.</p>
  <h2>The Influence of Ideology</h2>
  <p>Finally, ideology has played a key role in Meloni's transformation. Meloni, a self-described Christian conservative, has evolved from a staunch nationalist to a more moderate conservative, embracing liberal democracy and the rule of law as key pillars of her political vision.</p>
  <p>For example, Meloni has softened her position on same-sex marriage, arguing that the government should not interfere in people's private lives. She has also softened her stance on immigration, recognizing that Italy has a moral obligation to help refugees fleeing war and political persecution.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In summary, the taming of Giorgia Meloni is a perfect example of how neoliberalism, geopolitics, and ideology can shape a politician's beliefs and reshape their political identity. Meloni has evolved from a nationalist firebrand to a moderate conservative, embracing economic liberalism, geopolitical pragmatism, and social liberalism as key components of her political vision.</p>
  <p>The transformation of Giorgia Meloni is significant in that it mirrors a broader shift in European politics, away from traditional conservatism and towards a more pragmatic, centrist approach that embraces economic liberalism, globalization, and multiculturalism. Whether this shift will continue remains to be seen, but it is clear that Giorgia Meloni and her party are now playing a key role in shaping the future of Italian politics.</p>
