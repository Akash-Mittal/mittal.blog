  </header><!-- Interesting Story -->
  <p>When Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India, visited the United States recently, there was a lot of buzz about how it would impact the India-US alignment on China. Many experts believed that Modi's visit could be a game-changer in the strategic competition between the two Asian giants, as well as in the broader Indo-Pacific region.</p><!-- Examples -->
  <p>The India-US alignment has already been influenced by China's growing assertiveness in the region. Both India and the US have voiced concerns about China's territorial disputes in the South China Sea and its Belt and Road Initiative, which they see as an attempt to expand its influence and dominance. India has also been wary of China's close relations with its traditional rival Pakistan and has long sought to balance China's rise by deepening its strategic partnership with the US.</p>
  <p>Thus, Modi's visit to the US was seen as an opportunity to strengthen the India-US partnership and align their strategies on China. During his visit, Modi met with US President Joe Biden and other top officials and discussed a wide range of issues, including China's growing influence in the region. The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to upholding a free and open Indo-Pacific and agreed to deepen their cooperation on security, technology, and trade.</p><!-- Case Studies -->
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <h3>Quad Summit: India, US, Japan, and Australia</h3>
  <p>The Quad, or the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, is a strategic forum comprising India, the US, Japan, and Australia, which was formed in 2007 but had been inactive for several years. However, it has gained momentum in recent years as a vehicle for promoting a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific region, which is seen as a counterbalance to China's assertiveness. During Modi's visit to the US, the Quad held its first in-person summit, which was seen as a major milestone in its development. The four leaders pledged to deepen their cooperation on a wide range of issues, including security, climate change, and technology, and to work together to promote a rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
  <h3>Defense Partnership: India and the US</h3>
  <p>Defense and security have been a key area of cooperation between India and the US for many years, but their partnership has gained momentum in recent years as they seek to balance China's rise. During Modi's visit to the US, the two countries signed several defense agreements, including the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) for geospatial cooperation, which would enable them to share real-time intelligence and enhance their military interoperability.</p>
  <h3>Technology and Trade: India and the US</h3>
  <p>The US is India's second-largest trading partner and a major source of technology. During Modi's visit to the US, the two countries announced several initiatives to boost their trade and economic ties, including the launch of a new strategic economic dialogue and the creation of a new working group on emerging technologies. They also pledged to work together to promote a rules-based international trading system and to deepen their cooperation on climate change.</p><!-- Conclusion -->
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Modi's visit to the US has indeed boosted the India-US alignment on China. The Quad summit and the defense and economic agreements signed during the visit have deepened their cooperation and aligned their strategies on a wide range of issues, including China's growing assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region. The following are the key takeaways:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The India-US partnership is crucial for countering China's influence and advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific.</li>
   <li>The Quad summit has become a key platform for promoting regional security and stability in the face of China's assertiveness.</li>
   <li>The defense and economic agreements signed during Modi's visit have strengthened the India-US partnership and aligned their strategies on China.</li>
