  <title>Once upon a time, there was a small village in India where two neighboring families always fought with each other. One day, a wise person suggested that they should unite and work together instead of fighting each other. Soon after, the two families started collaborating and the village flourished.</title>

  <p>This story may seem simple, but the same concept applies to international relations as well. India, the United States, and China are three of the largest economies in the world. And as these countries become more interconnected, it is essential for them to work together towards a common goal rather than fight against each other.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Several lawmakers in the United States have one issue they would like Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to bring up during his address to Congress: joining the U.S. in countering China. This shows that the U.S. is keen on forming a strategic alliance with India to balance China's growing power in the region. But is India willing to join hands with the U.S. in countering China? Let's take a look at some examples and case studies to evaluate this question.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One of the primary reasons why the U.S. wants India to join hands with them is China's growing territorial ambitions in the Indo-Pacific region. China has been aggressively trying to expand its presence in the South China Sea, which is a major cause of concern for the U.S. and its allies in the region. To counter China's expansionist policies, the U.S. has been trying to form a coalition of countries under the Quad, which includes the U.S., India, Japan, and Australia.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>India's growing proximity to the U.S. was evident during the recent India-China standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh. India and China have a long-standing border dispute, and the recent clashes have further escalated tensions between the two countries. During this time, the U.S. extended its support to India and criticized China's actions. This was seen as a positive sign by India, and it may encourage the country to form closer ties with the U.S.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another example of India's growing proximity to the U.S. is the growing trade ties between the two countries. The U.S. is India's second-largest trading partner after China, and the two countries have been working towards increasing trade ties. In 2019, the U.S. and India signed a trade deal worth $3 billion, which includes the sale of military equipment and energy products. This trade partnership can further strengthen India's economic ties with the U.S. and encourage the country to form strategic alliances with the U.S. in the future.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The case of Australia is a prime example of how a country can balance its relations with both the U.S. and China. Australia is a close ally of the U.S., but it also has strong economic ties with China. However, in recent years, China has been using its economic power to influence Australia's policies, which has caused tensions between the two countries. To counter China's influence, Australia has been trying to balance its relations with both the U.S. and China.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, India's willingness to join hands with the U.S. in countering China is still uncertain. However, recent events show that India is growing closer to the U.S. and is open to forming strategic alliances with the country. The U.S. needs India's support to balance China's growing power in the region, and India needs the U.S. to counter China's expansionist policies. In this regard, forming a strategic alliance between the two countries can be beneficial for both sides.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In summary, the three main points of this article are:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. The U.S. wants India to join hands with them to counter China's growing territorial ambitions in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
  <p>2. India's growing proximity to the U.S. is evident from recent events such as the India-China standoff and increasing trade ties.</p>
  <p>3. Balancing relations with both the U.S. and China can be beneficial for countries like Australia, and India can learn from their example.</p>
