    <p>It's a hot day in Mumbai, India. A young man named Rohit is working in his uncle's small shop selling electronics when a group of Americans walks in. The Americans are from a major tech company and they are looking for a local partner to expand their business in India. Rohit's uncle sees an opportunity and introduces Rohit to the Americans. Rohit speaks fluent English and has a degree in business. The Americans are impressed and offer him a job. Rohit is ecstatic and his life changes forever.</p>
    <h2>Examples of the Growing Partnership</h2>
    <p>The story of Rohit is not unique. American companies are increasingly looking towards India for business opportunities. According to the U.S.-India Business Council, trade between the two countries has grown from $20 billion in 2001 to $149 billion in 2019. American companies are attracted to India's large population and growing middle class. India is also becoming a hub for tech innovation, with companies like Infosys and Wipro leading the charge. American tech giants like Google and Facebook are investing in India, and Amazon has announced plans to invest $1 billion in the country.</p>
    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>One example of the growing economic partnership between America and India is the joint venture between Boeing and Tata Advanced Systems. The two companies have partnered to manufacture Apache helicopter fuselages in India. This partnership not only creates jobs in India, but also helps Boeing meet offset requirements for a contract with the Indian government. Another example is Walmart's acquisition of Flipkart, an Indian e-commerce company. The acquisition helps Walmart gain a foothold in the Indian market and compete with Amazon.</p>
