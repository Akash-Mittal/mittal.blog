  <h1>No Good or Bad Terrorists</h1></br> <img src="images/No-Good-or-Bad-Terrorists.jpeg" alt="+No-Good-or-Bad-Terrorists+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.news18.com/world/no-good-or-bad-terrorists-india-slams-china-for-backing-2611-mastermind-sajid-mir-8132377.html" target="_blank" href="https://www.news18.com/world/no-good-or-bad-terrorists-india-slams-china-for-backing-2611-mastermind-sajid-mir-8132377.html" rel="noopener">https://www.news18.com/world/no-good-or-bad-terrorists-india-slams-china-for-backing-2611-mastermind-sajid-mir-8132377.html</a></span></h5>
  <p>In November 2008, India suffered one of the worst terrorist attacks in its history. A group of terrorists from Pakistan, backed by the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) militant group, carried out a series of coordinated attacks in Mumbai, targeting luxury hotels, a popular cafe, and a train station, among other targets. The attacks lasted for three days and resulted in the deaths of 166 people, including foreigners.</p><img src="https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2018/01/Mumbaiattack.jpg" alt="Mumbai attack">
  <blockquote>
   "We share the grief of the families who lost their loved ones in these attacks. We salute the courage of the Indian security forces who fought bravely against the terrorists. We stand in solidarity with the people of India in their fight against terrorism."
  </blockquote>
  <p>This was the message from China's Foreign Ministry in the aftermath of the Mumbai attacks. Many Indians were heartened by this expression of solidarity from their neighbor to the north. However, the recent revelation that China had been backing Sajid Mir, one of the masterminds behind the attacks, has sent shockwaves through the country.</p>
  <h2>The Backing of Sajid Mir</h2>
  <p>The news that China had been supporting Sajid Mir came to light thanks to an investigation by ProPublica, a US-based news outlet. According to their report, Mir had been receiving training and support from Chinese intelligence agents for several years before the Mumbai attacks.</p>
  <p>The revelation has sparked outrage in India, with many people calling for a boycott of Chinese goods and services. Some have even called for a diplomatic break with China.</p>
  <h2>No Good or Bad Terrorists</h2>
  <p>This is not the first time that China's support for terrorist groups has come under scrutiny. In recent years, there have been allegations that China has been providing support to militants in the Xinjiang region, as well as to groups in Pakistan and Afghanistan.</p>
  <p>China has denied these allegations, but the evidence suggests otherwise. The fact that China has been backing Sajid Mir, one of the masterminds behind the Mumbai attacks, is just further proof that China has no qualms about supporting terrorist groups when it suits its interests.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>There have been several other instances of countries backing terrorist groups for their own purposes. Here are some examples:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>US support for the Mujahideen in Afghanistan:</strong> During the Cold War, the US backed the Mujahideen in their fight against the Soviet Union. This support helped to create the conditions for the rise of the Taliban and al-Qaeda.</li>
   <li><strong>Pakistan's support for the Taliban:</strong> Pakistan has long been accused of providing support to the Taliban in Afghanistan. This support has been a major factor in the ongoing conflict in the region.</li>
   <li><strong>Saudi Arabia's support for extremist groups:</strong> There have been allegations that Saudi Arabia has been providing financial support to extremist groups around the world. While Saudi Arabia has denied these allegations, there is evidence to suggest that this support has been instrumental in the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <div id="conclusion">
   <h3>There are several key takeaways from the revelation of China's support for Sajid Mir:</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>The idea that there are no good or bad terrorists is a dangerous one. Terrorist groups are responsible for the deaths and suffering of innocent people around the world. Those who support these groups, whether for ideological or strategic reasons, are complicit in these crimes.</li>
    <li>The international community needs to take a stronger stance against countries that support terrorist groups. Countries like China, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia should be held accountable for their actions, and made to pay a price for supporting terrorists.</li>
    <li>The fight against terrorism is a global one, and it requires cooperation and coordination among all nations. Countries need to work together to share intelligence, cut off funding to terrorist groups, and bring those responsible for terrorism to justice.</li>
   </ol>
