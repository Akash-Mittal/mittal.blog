    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>The SAFF Championship match between India and Pakistan turned into a fiery altercation when players from both teams got into a heated exchange during the game. The match was played on Monday, October 11, 2021, at the Bangabandhu National Stadium in Dhaka, Bangladesh.</p>
    <p>The dispute began when a member of the Indian team, Liston Colaco, was tackled by Pakistani defender Mohammad Arslan. Colaco took exception to the tackle and pushed Arslan, which led to other players from both teams joining in the melee. The incident resulted in four yellow cards being issued, two for each team.</p>
    <p>What followed was a tense and nervy affair, with both teams struggling to break the deadlock. The match eventually ended in a goalless draw, but the altercation drew widespread attention, igniting a raging debate over whether the behaviour exhibited by the players was appropriate.</p>

    <h2>Examples of Heated Exchanges in Football Matches</h2>
    <p>The India-Pakistan incident is just one of many instances of players getting into heated exchanges during football matches. In 2018, a Champions League tie between Liverpool and Roma was marred by violence, as Roma fans attacked Liverpool supporters before the game. In another instance, in a Spanish La Liga match between Barcelona and Real Madrid, players from both teams got into a scuffle, which led to a red card for Real Madrid's Sergio Ramos.</p>
    <p>Other examples include a Premier League match between Arsenal and Manchester United, which saw a disagreement between players after a tackle by Arsenal's Patrick Vieira. In 2002, a World Cup match between Germany and Saudi Arabia was overshadowed by an ugly brawl between players from both teams.</p>

    <h2>Past Instances of India-Pakistan Football Rivalry</h2>
    <p>The India-Pakistan football rivalry has a long and storied history. The two teams have played each other several times, with India having the upper hand in the early years. However, Pakistan has had more success in recent years, having won the SAFF Championship twice, in 2005 and 2013.</p>
    <p>One of the most memorable encounters between the two teams was in the 2011 SAFF Championship final, where India defeated Pakistan 4-0. The win was significant for India, as Pakistan had gone unbeaten in the tournament before the final. India's Sunil Chhetri scored two goals, while an own goal by Pakistani goalkeeper Amir Gul and a goal by Sushil Kumar Singh completed the scoring.</p>
    <p>Another notable encounter between the two teams was in the 2015 SAFF Championship, where India defeated Pakistan 2-1 in the semi-final. A brace from Chhetri helped India overcome an early deficit to win the match and advance to the final.</p>
