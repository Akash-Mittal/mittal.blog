    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>India and China have been pitted against each other in terms of economic growth and global influence. However, recent predictions suggest that India is set to outshine China in the coming years.</p>
    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the global economy, and Asia is proving to be a bright spot for growth. While China is still expected to see economic growth, India's economy is predicted to grow at a faster rate, surpassing China in the process.</p>
    <p>But what factors are contributing to India's predicted growth and why is it set to outperform its neighbor?</p>
   </section>
   <section id="examples">
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>One of the main drivers behind India's predicted economic growth is its population, specifically its young workforce. India has the largest population of young people in the world, with a median age of 28. This demographic is expected to contribute significantly to the country's economy. As this group enters the workforce, they will increase demands for goods and services, providing a boost for the economy.</p>
    <p>Another contributing factor is India's digital landscape. India has one of the largest digital markets in the world, with over 500 million internet users. This market is expected to grow significantly, with the government investing heavily in infrastructure and programs to promote digitalization. The digital market is a key driver of economic growth, and India is well positioned to take advantage of it.</p>
    <p>Finally, India's manufacturing sector is also set to play a key role in the country's growth. India has invested heavily in promoting manufacturing, with initiatives such as "Make in India" encouraging foreign investment in the sector. The country's skilled workforce and abundance of raw materials make it an attractive destination for manufacturers looking to expand their operations.</p>

   <section id="case-studies">
    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>One example of India's growth potential can be seen in the automotive industry. India is the world's fifth-largest automotive market, with sales expected to grow significantly in the coming years. The country's young, tech-savvy population is driving demand for the latest products and innovations, while government policies such as the "National Electric Mobility Mission Plan" are promoting the adoption of electric vehicles. Domestic companies such as Tata Motors and Mahindra &amp; Mahindra are leading the way in innovation, with Tata Motors recently launching India's first electric SUV, the Nexon EV.</p>
    <p>Another industry set to benefit from India's growth is e-commerce. With a growing middle class and increasing internet penetration, online shopping is becoming more popular in India. Companies such as Flipkart and Amazon are investing heavily in the market, with Amazon recently announcing a $1 billion investment in India. The rise of e-commerce is creating opportunities for small and medium-sized businesses, with platforms such as Shopify and WooCommerce making it easier for entrepreneurs to launch and grow online businesses.</p>
    <p>Finally, India's pharmaceutical industry is also poised for growth. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic highlighting the importance of healthcare, India's expertise in producing generic drugs and vaccines is becoming increasingly valuable. The country is the world's largest supplier of generic drugs, and pharmaceutical companies such as Serum Institute of India are playing a critical role in producing COVID-19 vaccines for the world.</p>

   <section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In summary, India's predicted economic growth is driven by its young population, growing digital market, and expanding manufacturing sector. As the country continues to invest in these areas, it is well positioned to outperform China as a key player in global growth. However, challenges such as infrastructure, political stability, and inequality will need to be addressed in order for India to fully realize its potential.</p>
    <p>To recap, the three main points of India's predicted growth are:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>India's young population driving demand for goods and services</li>
     <li>Growing digital market promoting innovation and growth</li>
     <li>Expanding manufacturing sector attracting foreign investment</li>
    </ol>
