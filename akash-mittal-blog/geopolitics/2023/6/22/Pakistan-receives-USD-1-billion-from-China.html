   <p>Pakistan and China's friendship goes back to the 1950s when Pakistan became one of the first countries to recognize China as a sovereign state. The relationship between the two countries has grown stronger with time and has survived many ups and downs. Recently, China has once again shown its support to Pakistan by providing it with USD 1 billion for economic and social development.</p>
   <h2>Examples of China's Support</h2>
   <p>China has been a major source of support for Pakistan in many fields. Some examples are:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>China is currently working on the development of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which is a collection of infrastructure projects that will connect Gwadar Port in southwestern Pakistan to China's northwestern region of Xinjiang through a network of highways, railways, and pipelines. The project is expected to fill Pakistan's infrastructure gap and create many job opportunities.</li>
    <li>China has supported Pakistan in its fight against terrorism and has provided it with military and defense-related equipment.</li>
    <li>China has always been supportive of Pakistan's stance on the Kashmir issue and has sided with Pakistan in the United Nations and other international forums.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Case Studies of China-Pakistan Friendship</h2>
   <p>China and Pakistan's friendship has stood the test of time and has served as an example of strong bilateral relations. Some case studies are:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>The construction of the Karakoram Highway (KKH) in the 1970s was a major milestone in China-Pakistan relations. The KKH is a 1300 km long highway that connects Pakistan with China's Xinjiang province. It was built with Chinese assistance and is a symbol of the friendship between the two countries.</li>
    <li>China's support to Pakistan during the 1971 war with India was crucial in preventing Pakistan's complete defeat. China provided Pakistan with intelligence, military equipment, and diplomatic support, which helped Pakistan continue the war for longer than it would have been able to otherwise.</li>
    <li>The recent provision of USD 1 billion by China to Pakistan shows China's commitment to supporting Pakistan's economic development and stability.</li>
   </ol>
