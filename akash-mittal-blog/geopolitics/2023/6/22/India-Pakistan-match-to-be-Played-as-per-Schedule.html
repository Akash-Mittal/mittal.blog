    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>Cricket is not just a sport in India and Pakistan, it is a way of life. The popularity of the game can be seen from the fact that people of all ages, from all walks of life, are passionate about it. It is not uncommon to see people playing cricket on the streets, in parks, and even in the smallest of villages. Even during the pandemic, when everything else was shut down, people found ways to play cricket while following the necessary safety protocols.</p>
    <p>The India-Pakistan match is a prime example of how the game of cricket can unite two nations. Despite the political tension, the fans of both teams come together to support their favorite players.

    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>One of the most famous India-Pakistan matches was the 2007 ICC T20 World Cup final. The game was played in Johannesburg, and the tension between the two countries was at an all-time high. India had won the toss and elected to bat first, setting a target of 158 runs. Pakistan struggled to keep up with the required run-rate and eventually fell short by just 5 runs. The game was a prime example of how the game of cricket can be a source of tension, but also how it can bring people together.</p>
    <p>Another example of cricket being a unifying force is the 2011 World Cup semi-final between India and Pakistan. The game was played in Mohali, India, and it was a highly anticipated match. The two countries had not played a bilateral series in five years due to political tensions, and the World Cup match was seen as an opportunity to revive cricketing ties between the two nations. India went on to win the match, but the real victory was the fact that the match was played in good spirits and without any major incidents.</p>
