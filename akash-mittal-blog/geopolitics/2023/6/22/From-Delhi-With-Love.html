  <p>Delhi, the capital of India, is a city that ignites the senses. It is a place where history and modernity coexist, where tradition meets technology, and where you can find the best of everything.</p>
  
  <p>I will never forget the day I landed in Delhi for the first time. The bustling streets, the blaring horns, the spicy smells, and the vibrant colors overwhelmed me. I was lost in the sea of people, struggling to find my way to my hotel. Suddenly, a kind stranger approached me and offered me help. He not only guided me to my destination but also gave me some valuable tips for exploring the city. That was my first encounter with the warmth and hospitality of Delhiites.</p>
  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p>Delhi is a city that has something for everyone. If you are interested in history, you can explore the magnificent Red Fort, Humayun's Tomb, and Qutub Minar. If you love shopping, you can visit the bustling markets of Chandni Chowk, Sarojini Nagar, and Connaught Place. If you are a foodie, you can indulge in the mouth-watering street food, such as chaat, chole bhature, parathas, and kebabs.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>Delhi is also a hub of innovation and entrepreneurship. Many startups and tech companies have emerged from the city and are making a mark in their respective fields. For instance, Zomato, a food delivery and restaurant discovery platform, started in Delhi and now operates in over 24 countries. PolicyBazaar, an online insurance aggregator, is another Delhi-based startup that has revolutionized the insurance industry in India.</p>
