  <p></p>
  <p>This story may seem fictional, but it is not far from the reality faced by the people living in Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK). They have been living in utter poverty and oppression under the administration of Pakistan, bound by chains of corruption and terror.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In recent times, the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath, took a dig at Pakistan for its failed efforts to develop PoK and mocking the situation of its citizens. He stated that the residents of PoK were struggling to get two meals a day and dream of joining India for a better life.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This reveals the bitter truth that despite being in Pakistan's possession for over 70 years, PoK remains underdeveloped and neglected. The lack of opportunities and basic amenities has led the people to become desperate, seeking help from their neighboring Indian counterparts for support.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The situation in PoK is a grave example of the consequences of corrupt governance, poor policies, and disregard for basic human rights. In comparison, India has made remarkable progress in various sectors, including education, infrastructure, and healthcare, giving its citizens a better standard of living.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The case of PoK is not unique. Many other regions and countries worldwide are facing similar issues that are retarding their development and growth potential. For instance, the African continent has a vast untapped potential but lacks the infrastructural prerequisites to fulfill its potential.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Therefore, investing in infrastructure, education, and healthcare should be the top priority for governments worldwide. Better living conditions translate to a healthier, more prosperous community, leading to increased economic growth and innovation.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>To drive the point home, let us look at some case studies. In Rwanda, investments were made in the healthcare sector, which resulted in a reduction of diseases, improved life expectancy, and a stronger economy. Similarly, investments in education and small businesses have led to great results in Vietnam, promoting growth and development.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, the world has many regions that are lagging in development and progress due to poor governance and neglected infrastructure. However, with proper investments in key sectors such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, every society can attain growth and fuel development. It is imperative to prioritize the masses to allow them to participate in the cumulative growth of the nation and create a better future for all.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Key Takeaways:</p>
  <p>- Neglected infrastructure and poor governance lead to underdevelopment and deprivation of basic amenities.</p>
  <p>- Investment in key sectors such as healthcare, education and infrastructure promotes growth and development.</p>
  <p>- Prioritizing the masses in the developmental process enables them to participate in the cumulative growth of the nation.</p>
