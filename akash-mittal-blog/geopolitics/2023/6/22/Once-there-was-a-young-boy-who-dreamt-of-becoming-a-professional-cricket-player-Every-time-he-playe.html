  <p>The rivalry between India and Pakistan in the game of cricket is nothing new. It's been there for decades, and every time they face each other, the atmosphere becomes electric. The spectators chant their favorite team's slogans, the players give it their all, and the whole world watches in awe. That's why the news of the ICC releasing the World Cup 2023 schedule and the India-Pakistan faceoff likely to take place in Ahmedabad has taken everyone by storm.</p>
  <p></p>

  <p>Similarly, the World Cup 2015 saw a lot of upsets, with some of the strongest teams being knocked out early on. However, it was New Zealand who emerged as the dark horse, making it all the way to the finals where they faced Australia. Even though they lost the match, they won the hearts of millions of cricket fans across the world.</p>
  <p></p>

  <p>2. There will be some surprises: The World Cup is known for throwing up unexpected results. We've seen underdogs beat strong teams, and we've seen favorites crash out early. So be prepared for some surprises in the 2023 event as well.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. It's not just about the players: The World Cup brings people together from all over the world. It's a time when we set aside our differences and cheer for our teams. It's a time when we forget about our problems and celebrate the spirit of the game. So even if you're not a cricket fan, you can still be a part of this global event.</p>
