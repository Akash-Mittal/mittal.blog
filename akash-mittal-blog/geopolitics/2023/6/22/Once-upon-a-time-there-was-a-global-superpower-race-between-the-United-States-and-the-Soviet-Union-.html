  <h1>Once upon a time, there was a global superpower race between the United States and the Soviet Union called the Cold War. Now, in the 21st century, there is talk of a new Cold War between the US and China. As tensions rise between the two nations, India has found itself in the middle. In a move to counter China's military expansion, the US and India have agreed to a fighter jet deal worth $2.6 billion.</h1></br> <img src="images/Once-upon-a-time-there-was-a-global-superpower-race-between-the-United-States-and-the-Soviet-Union-.jpeg" alt="+Once-upon-a-time-there-was-a-global-superpower-race-between-the-United-States-and-the-Soviet-Union-+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/06/22/usa-india-fighter-jet-deal-joe-biden-narendra-modi/" target="_blank" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/06/22/usa-india-fighter-jet-deal-joe-biden-narendra-modi/" rel="noopener">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/06/22/usa-india-fighter-jet-deal-joe-biden-narendra-modi/</a></span></h5>
  <p></p>
  <p>This deal will supply India with 24 MH-60R Seahawk Romeo maritime helicopters, and six AH-64E attack helicopters. The Seahawk Romeos are capable of anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare, making them ideal for the Indian Navy. The AH-64E attack helicopters are known as the "Guardian". They are equipped with weapons and sensors, giving them the ability to conduct precision attacks in any environment.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>India is no stranger to conflict with China. The two countries have long disputed their border, and tensions have recently risen due to increased Chinese military activity in the region. In June 2020, a violent clash between Indian and Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley left 20 Indian soldiers dead. This deal with the US gives India a strategic advantage over China.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>But the US-India fighter jet deal is just a small part of the larger picture of the US-China Cold War II. China has been rapidly expanding its military capabilities, including its navy, which is now the largest in the world. The US has responded by increasing its military presence in the South China Sea and forging alliances with countries in the region, like India.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One example of these alliances is the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad. The Quad is a strategic alliance between the US, Japan, India, and Australia, formed in 2007 to counter China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region. The Quad has recently gained momentum, with the four countries holding their first joint naval exercises in November 2020.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another example is the US-China economic war. In 2018, the US began imposing tariffs on Chinese goods, starting an economic battle that continues to this day. The US has also imposed sanctions on Chinese companies, including tech giant Huawei. China has responded by imposing its own tariffs and sanctions on US companies.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>These examples show that the US-China Cold War II has far-reaching implications beyond military conflict. It is a battle for influence and dominance in the world, and it is being fought on multiple fronts.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>But what does all this mean for the rest of the world? For one, it means that smaller nations like India will need to choose sides. As China's influence grows, it will become increasingly difficult for countries to maintain neutrality. This could lead to a new era of alliances and conflicts, as countries try to protect their interests.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another implication is the impact on the global economy. The US-China economic war has already had significant consequences, with both countries experiencing economic downturns. The rest of the world has also felt the effects, with countries like Australia and Canada caught in the crossfire of the US-China trade battle.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, the US-India fighter jet deal is just one example of the larger US-China Cold War II. This new global superpower race has implications for the rest of the world, including smaller nations that will need to choose sides and the global economy, which is already feeling the effects of the US-China economic war. As tensions continue to rise, it is important for countries to stay informed and to consider how their actions could impact the world as a whole.</p>
