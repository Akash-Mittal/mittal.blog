   <p>Recently, India and the United States proposed to blacklist Pak-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist Sajid Mir, who is also one of the prime accused in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks. However, China blocked the proposal citing "insufficient evidence."</p>
   <p>This move has caused outrage among Indians and Americans alike, who believe that China is protecting a notorious terrorist who participated in the killing of innocent civilians and caused widespread destruction.</p>
   <h2>The Importance of Blacklisting Terrorists</h2>
   <p>Blacklisting a terrorist is a common practice employed by nations to counter terrorism. It involves imposing economic sanctions, travel bans, arms embargoes, and freezing of assets on individuals or entities linked to terrorism.</p>
   <p>It sends a strong message to terrorists and their sponsors that their actions have consequences and that the international community does not tolerate such heinous acts.</p>
   <p>Moreover, blacklisting makes it harder for terrorists to access funds and weapons, which in turn disrupts their operations and reduces their ability to inflict harm.</p>
   <h2>The Case of Sajid Mir</h2>
   <p>Sajid Mir is a notorious terrorist who belongs to the LeT, a Pakistan-based jihadist group that has been responsible for several terrorist attacks in India, including the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people and injured over 300 others.</p>
   <p>Mir is believed to be one of the masterminds behind the Mumbai attacks, with Indian authorities alleging that he trained and directed the 10 terrorists who carried out the strikes.</p>
   <p>Besides the Mumbai attacks, Mir is also linked to other terror attacks in India, including the 2006 Mumbai train bombings, the 2016 Pathankot airbase attack, and the 2019 Pulwama attack.</p>
   <p>Despite all this, China blocked India and the United States' proposal to blacklist Mir, citing insufficient evidence. This move has been criticized by many as being a blatant attempt by China to shield one of its terrorist allies.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Blacklisting terrorists is an important step in countering terrorism as it sends a strong message to terrorists and their sponsors that their actions have consequences.</li>
    <li>Sajid Mir is a notorious terrorist who is linked to several terror attacks in India and should have been blacklisted by the international community.</li>
    <li>China's move to block the proposal to blacklist Mir has been criticized as being an attempt to protect one of its terrorist allies and is a cause for concern.</li>
