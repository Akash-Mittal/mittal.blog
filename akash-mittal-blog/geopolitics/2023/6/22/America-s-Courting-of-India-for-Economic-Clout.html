  <p>In 1991, India was on the verge of economic collapse. The country had only 3 weeks' worth of foreign reserves left, and its inflation rate was at a staggering 17%. Desperate, India turned to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a bailout of $2.2 billion. Fast forward to 2021, India has become the world's sixth-largest economy, with a GDP of $2.7 trillion. Its rapid growth has caught the attention of the United States, which is now courting India for its economic potential.</p><!-- Examples -->
  <h2>Examples of America's Courting of India</h2>
  <p>One of the most notable examples of America's courting of India is the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF), a policy advocacy and business development organization that aims to strengthen economic ties between the two countries. Founded in 2017, the USISPF has already facilitated over $40 billion in business deals between Indian and American companies.</p>
  <p>In addition, the US and India have also signed several trade agreements in recent years. In 2019, the two countries signed a deal to facilitate trade in agricultural products, and in 2020, they signed a $3 billion defense deal.</p><!-- Case Studies -->
  <h2>Case Studies of American Investments in India</h2>
  <p>One of the biggest American investments in India is Walmart's acquisition of Flipkart, a leading Indian e-commerce company. In 2018, Walmart acquired a 77% stake in Flipkart for $16 billion, making it the largest e-commerce deal in the world. This investment allowed Walmart to enter the rapidly growing Indian e-commerce market and expand its global reach.</p>
  <p>Another example is Amazon's significant investments in India. In 2020, Amazon announced that it would be investing $1 billion in India to help small and medium-sized businesses digitize their operations. This investment will create jobs and stimulate economic growth in India, while also benefiting Amazon by expanding its customer base in the country.</p><!-- Conclusion -->
