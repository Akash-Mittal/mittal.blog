  <p class="story">In the early hours of a winter morning in Tehran, five men sat around a table in a dimly lit boardroom. They were discussing a project that had been decades in the making – the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC). One of the men, an Iranian diplomat, leaned forward and said, "This is an opportunity to change the dynamic of trade in the region. It's a pipeline dream, but we can make it happen."</p>
  <p>The INSTC is a multi-modal transportation network connecting India and Iran via Central Asia to Russia and Europe. Covering a distance of over 7,200 kilometers, it consists of sea, rail, and road links that bypass traditional maritime routes and shorten the transport time and cost.</p>
  <p>The INSTC is not just a transportation project but a geopolitical one. It aims to reduce India's dependence on Pakistan for trade with Afghanistan and beyond, provide Iran with an alternative to the Strait of Hormuz for oil exports, and counter China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and Russia's energy dominance in Europe. In this article, we'll examine whether the INSTC is indeed a pipeline dream or a counterweight to Western sanctions and China's BRI.</p>
  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p>One of the main advantages of the INSTC is its ability to reduce transportation time and cost. For example, cargo traveling from Mumbai to Moscow via the traditional maritime route takes around 40 days and costs $2,500 per container. However, using the INSTC, the same cargo takes only 14 days and costs $1,500 per container. This makes the INSTC attractive for shippers and traders looking to reduce their transport costs and improve their supply chain efficiency.</p>
  <p>Another example is the Chabahar port in Iran, which is a key component of the INSTC. India has invested more than $500 million in the development of the port, which provides it with a strategic foothold in the region and access to Afghanistan and Central Asia. The Chabahar port is also seen as a counter to China's presence at the Gwadar port in Pakistan, which is a key node of China's BRI in the region.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>One of the success stories of the INSTC is the transportation of fertilizers from Iran to India. In 2018, Iran exported 70,000 tons of urea to India via the INSTC. The cargo was transported by rail from Iran's Bandar Abbas port to Russia's Astrakhan port and then by sea to India's Mundra port, a journey of around 20 days. This was the first time that such a large quantity of fertilizers was transported via the INSTC, and it demonstrated the corridor's potential for facilitating trade between India and Iran.</p>
  <p>Another case study is the transportation of wheat from India to Afghanistan via the Chabahar port. In 2017, India sent 1.1 million tons of wheat to Afghanistan via the Chabahar port. This marked a shift from the traditional route via Pakistan, which was often disrupted due to tensions between the two countries. The Chabahar port provided India with an alternative route to Afghanistan and reduced its dependence on Pakistan for trade with its neighbor.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>The INSTC is a promising project that has the potential to improve trade and connectivity between India, Iran, and Russia.</li>
   <li>The INSTC is also a geopolitical project that aims to counter China's BRI and Russia's energy dominance in Europe.</li>
   <li>However, the INSTC faces several challenges, including Western sanctions on Iran, lack of infrastructure, and geopolitical tensions in the region.</li>
