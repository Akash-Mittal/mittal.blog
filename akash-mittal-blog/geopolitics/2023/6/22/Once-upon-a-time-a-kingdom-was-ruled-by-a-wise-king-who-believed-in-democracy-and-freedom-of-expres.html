  <p>In recent times, "jhoola diplomacy" has become a buzzword in political circles. It refers to the use of soft power and diplomatic channels to resolve conflicts without resorting to military action or economic sanctions. It is a tool that is often used by politicians and diplomats to build bridges, establish trust, and promote dialogue. Jhoola diplomacy is not only effective but also cost-effective, as it can prevent costly wars and improve relations between countries.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One recent example of "jhoola diplomacy" is the meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Wuhan, China, in 2018. The two leaders sat on a swing by the side of a lake and discussed the thorny issues that divide the two nations. The "Wuhan Spirit," as the meeting came to be known, helped to ease tensions between India and China and set the stage for future cooperation.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another example of "jhoola diplomacy" is the meeting between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in 2018. The two leaders met at a resort in Singapore and sat on a swing by the pool while discussing the nuclear standoff between their countries. Although the meeting did not produce any concrete results, it was seen as a positive step towards peace and denuclearization.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In contrast to "jhoola diplomacy," there are some instances when hard power and economic sanctions are needed to deal with rogue nations and terrorists. One such case is that of Sajir Mir, a Pakistani militant who has been linked to several terrorist attacks in India. The Indian government has been trying to get Mir designated as a terrorist by the United Nations Security Council, but China has repeatedly blocked the move. China's obstructionism is seen as an attempt to protect its ally, Pakistan, from international scrutiny.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>However, China's stance on Sajir Mir has come under criticism from within India as well. The opposition Congress Party has accused the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of failing to use "jhoola diplomacy" to convince China to change its position. Congress MP Shashi Tharoor has alleged that the BJP has been more focused on domestic politics than on foreign policy, and has not done enough to engage with China on the issue of terrorism. Tharoor's comments reflect the growing frustration in India over China's seemingly unyielding support for Pakistan, despite evidence of its involvement in terrorism.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, "jhoola diplomacy" is a powerful tool for resolving conflicts and promoting peace. It can be used to build trust, establish dialogue, and prevent costly wars. However, there are times when hard power and economic sanctions are necessary to deal with rogue nations and terrorists. The case of Sajir Mir highlights the need for both "jhoola diplomacy" and hard power to tackle the scourge of terrorism.</p>
