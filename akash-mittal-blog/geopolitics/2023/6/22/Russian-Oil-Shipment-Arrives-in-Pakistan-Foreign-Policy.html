    <p>On May 2nd, 2021, a ship carrying Russian oil arrived at the Gwadar port in Pakistan. This was the first-ever shipment of Russian oil to Pakistan, marking the beginning of a new era of energy cooperation between the two countries.</p>
    <p>The arrival of this shipment was a significant moment for both Russia and Pakistan. For Russia, it represented an opportunity to expand its energy exports to a new market. For Pakistan, it was a step towards reducing its dependence on Middle Eastern oil and diversifying its energy supply.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>The Russian oil shipment to Pakistan is just one example of the growing energy cooperation between the two countries. In 2015, Russia and Pakistan signed a memorandum of understanding on energy cooperation, which paved the way for bilateral cooperation in areas such as oil and gas exploration, development, and transportation.</p>
    <p>Since then, there have been several other instances of energy cooperation between Russia and Pakistan. In 2018, Russia and Pakistan signed an agreement for the construction of a 1,100 kilometer gas pipeline from Karachi to Lahore. In 2020, Pakistan signed a deal with Russia to purchase liquefied natural gas (LNG) at competitive prices.</p>

    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <h3>Case Study 1: Russia-Pakistan Gas Pipeline</h3>
    <p>The Russia-Pakistan gas pipeline is a major energy project that was signed in 2018. The 1,100 kilometer pipeline will transport gas from Karachi to Lahore, providing much-needed energy to Pakistan's industrial heartland. The pipeline is expected to be completed by 2023 and will have a capacity of 12.4 billion cubic meters per year.</p>
    <h3>Case Study 2: Pakistan-Russia LNG Deal</h3>
    <p>The Pakistan-Russia LNG deal was signed in 2020, under which Pakistan will purchase LNG from Russia's Gazprom at competitive prices. The deal is expected to save Pakistan around $300 million per year in LNG costs and help to reduce its dependence on Middle Eastern suppliers.</p>
