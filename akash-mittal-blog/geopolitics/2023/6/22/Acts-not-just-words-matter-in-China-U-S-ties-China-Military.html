   <h2>An exploration of the intricacies of the relationship between two global powers</h2>

    <h3>The Story of a Bridge</h3>
    <p>When the Golden Gate Bridge was erected in 1937, it was considered a modern marvel that would solidify the relationship between San Francisco and its neighboring cities. It was a wonder of engineering, an iconic symbol of American progress. But it was also built at the expense of the Chinese.</p>
    <p>The materials used to build the bridge, including the steel, were procured from China. However, they were obtained at a cheap price due to the discriminatory treatment of Chinese laborers and the unfair wages they were paid. The Chinese were seen as expendable, a source of cheap labor that was easily replaceable.</p>
    <p>Fast forward to today, and the relationship between China and the United States is still complicated. Both countries are global powers with complex ties to each other and the rest of the world. The current state of their relationship is fraught with tension and uncertainties, with implications that can reach far beyond their borders.</p>

    <h3>Actions Speak Louder Than Words</h3>
    <p>Whether it is through trade deals, diplomatic exchanges, or military tension, the relationship between China and the United States is one that depends on action, not just words. The Trump Administration's tough stance towards China, with tariffs and sanctions being imposed, has had a tangible impact on their relationship. The same goes for China's response, with retaliatory measures being taken.</p>
    <p>But there are other less-visible actions that can affect the relationship as well. For example, the exchange of students and scholars between the two countries can have a major impact on the relationship. The United States has voiced concerns about intellectual property theft and spying by Chinese students and researchers, while China has criticized the potential for discrimination and racial profiling of Chinese nationals.</p>
    <p>Even seemingly unrelated issues can affect the relationship. For example, the current pandemic has had implications for the relationship between China and the United States. Accusations and finger-pointing over the origins and handling of the virus have led to increased tensions between the two countries. In September of 2020, the U.S. State Department reduced the number of Chinese journalists allowed to work in the United States, citing issues with censorship and propaganda.</p>

    <h3>Case Studies</h3>
    <h4>The South China Sea</h4>
    <p>The South China Sea is a critical location for both China and the United States, with overlapping claims to territory and resources. The dispute has been ongoing for years, with tensions high and the potential for military conflict looming.</p>
    <p>In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague ruled that China's claims to much of the South China Sea were invalid, a ruling that was met with outrage and dismissal by China. Since then, China has continued to build military installations and engage in other activities that reinforce their claims to the territory.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, the United States has continued to assert its presence in the region, through freedom of navigation operations and other actions that China sees as provocative. This has led to increased tensions and accusations from both sides of aggression.</p>
    <h4>The Trade War</h4>
    <p>The trade war between China and the United States began in 2018, with the Trump Administration imposing tariffs on Chinese imports to the United States. This was done in response to various concerns the administration had about China's trade practices, intellectual property theft, and other issues.</p>
    <p>In response, China imposed their own tariffs on U.S. goods, leading to a back-and-forth escalation of measures. The trade war had a major impact on the global economy, with businesses on both sides feeling the effects of the tariffs.</p>
    <p>The two countries eventually signed a "Phase One" trade deal in January of 2020, but tensions still exist and the deal has not been fully implemented. The COVID-19 pandemic has only added another layer of complexity to the situation, with both countries blaming each other for the spread of the virus.</p>
