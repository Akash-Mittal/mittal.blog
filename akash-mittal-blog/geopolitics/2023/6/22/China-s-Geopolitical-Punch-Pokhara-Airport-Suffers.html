    <p>Once upon a time, there were two neighboring countries - China and Nepal. Nepal, a small Himalayan nation, has been a close ally of India for decades. But in recent years, China has been making inroads into Nepal's economy and politics, much to India's disconcert. The latest example of this is the construction of the Pokhara International Airport.</p>
    <p>The new airport, which is being built with Chinese assistance, was expected to be completed by 2021 but has now been delayed until at least 2022. The reason for the delay is a dispute between the Nepalese government and the airport contractor, a Chinese company, over the payment of compensation to the locals who have been displaced by the airport project.</p>
    <p>The dispute highlights one of the risks that come with relying too heavily on a single foreign investor. While China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has been hailed as a game-changer for developing countries, it also exposes them to potential economic and political pressure from China.</p>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>The Pokhara Airport is just one example of China's growing influence in Nepal. In recent years, China has invested heavily in Nepal's infrastructure projects, including roads, hydropower plants, and telecommunications networks. China has also been wooing Nepal with aid, grants, and scholarships for Nepalese students to study in China.</p>
    <p>Another example is the proposed trans-Himalayan railway that would link China's Tibet Autonomous Region with Nepal's capital, Kathmandu. The railway would not only bring Chinese goods into Nepal but also provide China with direct access to the Indian Ocean via Nepal. This has alarmed India, which regards the railway as a strategic threat to its security.</p>
    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>The Hambantota Port in Sri Lanka is one of the most frequently cited case studies of China's geopolitical ambitions in South Asia. The port, which was built with Chinese loans and managed by a Chinese company, became a white elephant, unable to generate enough revenue to repay the loans. As a result, Sri Lanka had to hand over control of the port to China on a 99-year lease.</p>
    <p>The Gwadar Port in Pakistan is another example. The port is a flagship project of China's BRI and is being built with Chinese assistance. Like Hambantota, Gwadar has faced criticism over its economic viability and its potential use by China for military purposes. India has expressed concern that Gwadar could be used as a Chinese naval base, which would give China a strategic advantage in the Indian Ocean.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>China's rising influence in South Asia has set off alarm bells in India and other democracies in the region. While China's economic assistance has been welcomed by many developing countries, there are concerns about the geopolitical implications of China's involvement in their affairs. The delay in the Pokhara Airport is a reminder that China's interests do not always align with the interests of its partner countries. Developing countries need to be mindful of these risks and adopt a cautious approach when seeking economic assistance from China.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, the Pokhara Airport is a microcosm of the larger geopolitical struggle between India and China for influence in South Asia. The airport's delayed construction underscores the risks associated with over-reliance on a single foreign investor and highlights the need for developing countries to adopt a diversified approach to economic growth.</p>
