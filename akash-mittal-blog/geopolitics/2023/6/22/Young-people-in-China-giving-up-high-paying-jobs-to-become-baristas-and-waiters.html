    <h2>From dream job to serving coffee</h2>
    <p>In China, it is common for parents to pressure their children into pursuing high-paying jobs in finance, law, or medicine. However, many young people are now defying their parents and society's expectations by leaving their lucrative careers to follow their passion for coffee.</p>
    <p>One such person is Zhang Wei, a former investment banker who quit his job to become a barista. He said, "I realized I wanted a job that was more meaningful and could bring happiness to others."</p>
    <p>Many young people in China are also taking to social media platforms to share their stories of leaving high-paying jobs for the coffee industry. They talk about the satisfaction of being able to connect with people through coffee and the joy of creating latte art.</p>

    <h2>Examples of young people leaving high-paying jobs for coffee</h2>
    <p>Jin Qing is another example of a young person in China who gave up their law career to start a coffee shop. She said, "I was tired of the long hours and high-pressure environment of my law job. Running a coffee shop allows me to be my own boss and create a welcoming environment for my customers."</p>
    <p>Liu Yan was a successful online marketer before she quit to become a barista. She said, "I didn't feel fulfilled by my job. Making coffee for people and seeing the smile on their face is the most rewarding feeling."</p>
    <p>These stories are not isolated incidents. According to a survey by China Youth Daily, over 30% of Chinese people aged 18-35 are considering leaving their jobs to pursue their passions.</p>
