  <p>This story may seem like a fairytale, but it's actually a modern day dilemma faced by the European Union (EU) in its relationship with China. On December 16, 2020, the European Commission released a new strategy paper titled "EU-China: A Strategic Outlook" which aims to de-risk the EU's relationship with China. The paper acknowledges China's growing global influence and economic power, but also highlights the need for the EU to protect its own interests and values.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The EU's plan includes increasing market access for EU companies in China, strengthening reciprocal investment screening mechanisms, promoting fair competition through state aid rules, and protecting intellectual property rights. The plan also calls for cooperation with China on shared global challenges such as climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>However, getting all EU member states on board with this de-risking strategy may prove to be a challenge. Some member states, such as Hungary and Greece, have expressed interest in growing their economic ties with China and may resist measures that limit their access to the Chinese market. On the other hand, countries like Germany and France have pushed for greater scrutiny of Chinese investments and the protection of European intellectual property.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case studies from other countries offer insight into the benefits and challenges of de-risking ties with China. In Australia, a cooling of relations with China led to decreased exports and diplomatic tensions. However, Australia has also diversified its trading partners and strengthened its relationship with the US, allowing it to better handle the negative effects of the rift with China.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Similarly, Japan has taken steps to reduce its economic reliance on China and diversify its supply chain. This has led to increased investment in Southeast Asia and India, as well as strengthened trade relationships with the US and EU.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The EU's de-risking strategy may also benefit from collaboration with other like-minded countries, such as the US and Japan. In September 2020, the US and EU released a joint statement on shared values in cyberspace, technology, and global trade, highlighting concerns over China's behavior in these areas. Likewise, Japan has been building ties with the EU and US through initiatives such as the EU-Japan Partnership on Sustainable Connectivity and Quality Infrastructure and the US-Japan Trade Agreement.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, de-risking ties with China may be a difficult but necessary step for the EU to protect its interests and values in an increasingly uncertain global landscape. Lessons can be learned from Australia and Japan, who have successfully diversified their trading partners and strengthened their global position. Collaboration with like-minded countries such as the US and Japan may also bolster the EU's position. Three key takeaways from the EU's de-risking strategy include:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. The EU recognizes the need to balance economic benefits with the protection of its interests and values.</p>
  <p>2. Cooperation with other countries is beneficial in reducing economic reliance on China and strengthening global position.</p>
  <p>3. De-risking ties with China is not without challenges and may face resistance from some EU member states.</p>
