  <p>It is a well-known fact that justice delayed is justice denied. This maxim was proved true recently when China blocked India's proposal to blacklist Sajid Mir, one of the accused in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks. The move came as a major disappointment for India, which had been looking for justice for the victims of the attacks.</p>
  <p>To understand the gravity of the situation, let us delve a little deeper into the Mumbai terror attacks. On November 26, 2008, a group of terrorists arrived in Mumbai from Pakistan and launched a series of coordinated attacks that lasted for four days. The attacks were carried out in popular places like the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, the Oberoi Trident Hotel, and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station. The attacks left 166 people dead, including foreign nationals, and more than 300 people injured.</p>
  <p>The Mumbai terror attacks were not just an attack on India, but an attack on humanity. They highlighted the growing threat of terrorism, and the perils of global inaction in the face of this threat.</p>
  <h2>China's Decision to Block India's Proposal</h2>
  <p>India had been seeking to get Sajid Mir, who is said to be the mastermind behind the attacks, blacklisted by the United Nations. However, China, which is a permanent member of the UN Security Council, blocked the proposal, citing lack of sufficient evidence.</p>
  <p>China's decision to block India's proposal is not just an of act of injustice, it is also indicative of the growing tensions between the two countries. India has accused China of supporting terrorism in the region, with Chinese backing for Pakistan's terrorist activities being a particular point of contention between the two countries.</p>
  <p>The Mumbai terror attacks were carried out by the Pakistan-based terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), and the UN has already designated LeT as a terrorist organization. Sajid Mir, who is said to have played a key role in planning and coordinating the attacks, is also known to have deep connections with the highest echelons of the LeT leadership.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies of Other Terrorist Designation Proposals Rejected by China</h2>
  <p>China's decision to block India's proposal to blacklist Sajid Mir is not an isolated incident. In recent years, China has repeatedly blocked similar proposals by other countries, citing lack of evidence or procedural issues.</p>
  <p>One such example is China's decision to block India's proposal to designate Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar as a terrorist. India had been seeking to get Masood Azhar blacklisted by the UN since 2009, but China had repeatedly blocked the proposal citing lack of sufficient evidence.</p>
  <p>Another example is China's rejection of the proposal to designate Maulana Masood Azhar's brother, Abdul Rauf Asghar, as a terrorist. Abdul Rauf Asghar is said to have been the mastermind behind the attack on the Pathankot Air Force base in India in 2016.</p>
  <h2>The Implications of China's Decision</h2>
  <p>China's decision to block India's proposal to blacklist Sajid Mir has serious implications for the fight against terrorism. It not only undermines India's efforts to bring the perpetrators of the Mumbai terror attacks to justice, but also has wider implications for the global fight against terrorism.</p>
  <p>China's repeated blocking of proposals to designate terrorists sends a signal that it is willing to protect its interests, even at the cost of global security. This can embolden other countries to take similar actions, leading to a dangerous trend of countries protecting terrorists for their own interests.</p>
  <p>The international community needs to come together to address this issue. It is not just a matter of justice for the victims of the Mumbai terror attacks, but a matter of global security. Terrorism is a threat to humanity, and it is the responsibility of all countries to take action to combat it.</p>
