   <h3>The Unfortunate Reality of Terrorism in India</h3>
   <p>The terror attack on Mumbai, India in 2008 left the nation in disbelief. An estimated 166 people were killed and more than 300 were injured in a series of coordinated attacks on different locations in the city. The incident is often referred to as 26/11 in India, after the date on which the attacks began.</p>
   <p>Since then, India has been fighting to bring those responsible for the attacks to justice. One of the key figures in the attacks is wanted terrorist, Masood Azhar.</p>

  <div class="col-md-12">
   <h3>China's Blockade of Azhar's Blacklisting</h3>
   <p>Despite India's efforts, however, China has consistently blocked attempts to have Azhar blacklisted by the United Nations. In 2019, India once again put forward a proposal to have Azhar blacklisted, but China vetoed the move.</p>
   <p>India condemned China's actions, stating that the country had failed to acknowledge the threat posed by Azhar and his organization, Jaish-e-Mohammed, which has been responsible for numerous terror attacks in India.</p>
   <p>India also pointed out that China's refusal to blacklist Azhar sends a message to other terrorist organizations that it is possible to act with impunity, without fear of consequences from the international community.</p>

   <h3>The Impact of China's Blockade</h3>
   <p>China's blockade of the move to blacklist Azhar has far-reaching consequences for India and the international community as a whole. For India, it is a significant blow in their fight against terrorism, as it allows Azhar and Jaish-e-Mohammed to continue their activities without fear of being held accountable.</p>
   <p>The move also undermines the authority of the United Nations, which was established to promote peace, security and cooperation across the globe. By vetoing the move, China has essentially prevented the UN from fulfilling its mandate to combat terrorism.</p>
   <p>The incident has also strained India's relationship with China, which has been complicated by a number of issues in recent years, including border disputes, trade imbalances, and China's growing influence in Asia.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-12">
   <h3>Conclusion</h3>
   <p>The blockage of India's bid to blacklist Masood Azhar has far-reaching consequences. It sends a message to other terrorist organizations that they can act with impunity, undermines the authority of the United Nations, and strains relations between two major Asian powers. The international community must continue to work together to combat terrorism, and hold those responsible for terrorist activities accountable.</p>
