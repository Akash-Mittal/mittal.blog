  <h1>The Tale of Modi's Visit to Washington: Oil, Arms, and India's Sovereignty</h1></br> <img src="images/The-Tale-of-Modi-s-Visit-to-Washington-Oil-Arms-and-India-s-Sovereignty.jpeg" alt="+The-Tale-of-Modi-s-Visit-to-Washington-Oil-Arms-and-India-s-Sovereignty+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://oilprice.com/Geopolitics/International/Modi-Heads-To-Washington-To-Talk-Oil-Arms-And-Indias-Sovereignty.html" target="_blank" href="https://oilprice.com/Geopolitics/International/Modi-Heads-To-Washington-To-Talk-Oil-Arms-And-Indias-Sovereignty.html" rel="noopener">https://oilprice.com/Geopolitics/International/Modi-Heads-To-Washington-To-Talk-Oil-Arms-And-Indias-Sovereignty.html</a></span></h5>
  <p>Once upon a time, in an era of globalization, India and the United States decided to come together and strengthen their alliance. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Washington is yet another feather in the cap of India-US strategic partnership. During his week-long visit, Modi will hold meetings with President Joe Biden and other top officials. The key agenda includes strategic partnerships in climate change, trade, and defense. The talks will focus on a range of issues, including oil, arms, and India's sovereignty.</p>
  <h2>The Axis of Oil</h2>
  <p>India has a huge appetite for energy and imports almost 80% of its crude oil requirements. The US has been a significant supplier of crude oil to India. According to the US Energy Information Administration, the US was India's fourth-largest crude oil supplier in 2020. Apart from crude oil, India also imports natural gas from the US. During his visit, Modi is likely to discuss increased energy cooperation to ensure stable and affordable energy prices.</p>
  <h3>Case study</h3>
  <p>The US Energy Information Administration has projected that India's energy consumption will almost double by 2040. This presents a huge opportunity for the US to increase its energy exports to India. The US shale revolution has upended the global energy market. India has traditionally been dependent on OPEC countries for its energy needs. However, the availability of cheap shale gas from the US could lead to a significant shift in India's energy mix.</p>
  <h2>Arms Race</h2>
  <p>India is the world's second-largest arms importer. The US has emerged as a major supplier of defense equipment to India. The US-India defense trade has gone up significantly in the last decade. According to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the US accounted for over 20% of India's arms imports between 2016-2020. Defense deals are likely to be a crucial part of the discussions during Modi's visit.</p>
  <h3>Case study</h3>
  <p>The US has been pushing for a greater role for India in its Indo-Pacific strategy. The two countries recently signed the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement for Geo-Spatial Cooperation (BECA), which is expected to boost India's defense capabilities. The US has also been keen to sell its fighter jets to India. In 2019, India signed a deal with the US for the purchase of 24 MH-60R Seahawk helicopters worth $2.6 billion.</p>
  <h2>India's Sovereignty: Balancing China</h2>
  <p>China's growing assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region has become a cause for concern for India and the US. Modi's visit to the US comes at a time when China is increasing its military presence in the region. India and the US have been closely monitoring China's activities in the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean. Maritime security and defense cooperation are likely to be important areas of discussion during Modi's visit.</p>
  <h3>Case study</h3>
  <p>India and the US have been stepping up their military cooperation to counter China's growing influence in the region. The two countries have conducted joint military exercises, including the Malabar naval exercise, in the past. The US has also been pushing for India's inclusion in the Quad, a grouping consisting of the US, Japan, Australia, and India, which is seen as a counterweight to China's growing influence.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The relationship between India and the US has transformed significantly in the last two decades. The growing strategic partnership between the two countries has been a cause for concern for China. During Modi's visit to the US, both countries are likely to renew their commitment to deepening their alliance. The talks will focus on a range of issues, including energy cooperation, defense deals, and ensuring maritime security.</p>

   <li>India is likely to occupy a greater role in US strategic calculations in the Indo-Pacific region.</li>
   <li>Increased energy cooperation between India and the US could alter the global energy market.</li>
