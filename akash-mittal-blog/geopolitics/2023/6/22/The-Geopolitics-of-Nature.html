  <h1>The Elephant and the Border</h1></br> <img src="images/The-Geopolitics-of-Nature.jpeg" alt="+The-Geopolitics-of-Nature+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="http://www.jordantimes.com/opinion/simon-zadek/geopolitics-nature" target="_blank" href="http://www.jordantimes.com/opinion/simon-zadek/geopolitics-nature" rel="noopener">http://www.jordantimes.com/opinion/simon-zadek/geopolitics-nature</a></span></h5>
  <p>Once upon a time, a wild elephant wandered across the border of India and Nepal. The elephant, unaware of the geopolitical nature of the border, continued its journey until it was shot dead by Indian soldiers who saw it as a threat to national security. This incident is just one example of how the natural world and human politics often clash in unexpected ways.</p><!--some examples-->
  <h2>Natural Resources as a Political Tool</h2>
  <p>Natural resources such as oil, gas, and minerals have long been used as a political tool to gain power and influence in the international arena. For example, countries with abundant oil reserves such as Saudi Arabia have used their oil wealth to build alliances and exert influence over other countries. Similarly, countries like China and Russia have used their control over rare earth metals to gain political leverage over other nations.</p>
  <h2>Climate Change and National Security</h2>
  <p>Climate change is increasingly being recognized as a threat to national security. Rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and food and water scarcity can lead to social and political instability, which in turn can create security risks. For example, the Syrian civil war was fueled in part by a prolonged drought that made it difficult for farmers to make a living, leading to economic hardship and political unrest.</p><!--case studies-->
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <h3>The Arctic</h3>
  <p>The Arctic is becoming a key area of geopolitical competition as melting ice makes it more accessible to resource extraction and shipping. Russia, the United States, and Canada are all vying for control over the Arctic, with each country staking claims over the region's natural resources. The melting of the ice also has potential implications for global sea levels, which could have profound political and economic consequences.</p>
  <h3>South China Sea</h3>
  <p>The South China Sea has been the site of ongoing territorial disputes between China and its neighbors, who are all vying for control over the region's fisheries, energy resources, and shipping lanes. The dispute has led to increased militarization in the area and has triggered concerns over potential conflict. The natural resources at stake in the South China Sea are a key factor driving tensions in the region.</p><!--conclusion in 3 points-->
