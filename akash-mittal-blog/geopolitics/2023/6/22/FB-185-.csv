Once, there was a boy named Imran Khan in Pakistan. He wanted to become a cricketer but his parents did not support him. They wanted him to become a doctor or an engineer. However, Imran did not give up his dream and worked hard to become one of the best cricketers in the world. He led the Pakistan team to win the 1992 Cricket World Cup and became a national hero.
After retiring from cricket, Imran Khan became a politician and founded the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party in 1996. He promised to fight corruption, improve the economy, and bring justice to the people of Pakistan. He campaigned tirelessly for years and finally won the 2018 general elections to become the Prime Minister of Pakistan.

Imagine you are a foreign investor interested in Pakistan, a country with a strategic location, abundant natural resources and a young, skilled workforce. You have done your research and are convinced that investing in Pakistan could yield great returns. However, as you read the latest news on the country's economic situation, your enthusiasm is dampened.
You learn that Pakistan's foreign direct investment (FDI) has decreased by 21% in the first 8 months of the current fiscal year, compared to the same period last year. FDI inflows are down to $1.47 billion, from $1.86 billion in 2018-19. This is the lowest level of FDI in the first 8 months of a fiscal year since 2015-16.

The excitement and enthusiasm were at its peak in the opening match of the SAFF Championship as two arch-rivals Pakistan and India were facing each other on the football field. Both teams were determined to win the match and establish their dominance in the tournament. However, the game turned out to be a one-sided affair as India thrashed Pakistan with a scoreline of 7-0.
India dominated the game from the start and scored the first goal in the 18th minute of the match. Pakistan tried to make a comeback but failed to break the Indian defense. India kept on scoring goals and ended up with a massive victory over their rivals. Some notable performances were seen from Sunil Chhetri and debutant Farukh Choudhary as they both scored two goals each. Pakistan's poor performance in the game can be attributed to their weak defense and lack of coordination among the players.

A meeting between Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman on the sidelines of the Paris summit on climate change has raised many eyebrows and speculations. The event drew significant attention due to the timing of the meeting and its implications on the Pakistani-Saudi relations. This meeting also comes at a time when the Saudi monarchy is facing intense criticism from the international community due to its role in the Yemen war and the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
The meeting between Prime Minister Imran Khan and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman signifies the growing importance of Pakistani-Saudi relations in the region. Saudi Arabia has been a strong ally of Pakistan for decades and has provided significant financial and political support to the country. This meeting was an opportunity for both leaders to discuss bilateral cooperation in various areas of mutual interest such as trade, investment, and energy. This meeting may also have implications on the regional security situation, particularly in the Gulf and South Asia.

Geopolitics is a complex and dynamic field that often involves competing interests and conflicting goals between nations. In recent years, India and China have emerged as two of the world's most important players in this area, with each country seeking to expand its influence and assert its dominance in various regions around the globe.
However, this pursuit of power and influence can sometimes lead to petty squabbles and geopolitical maneuvers that are more about politics than actual security concerns. One recent example of this is the ongoing spat between India and China over a Pak-based terrorist, where both sides are engaging in tit-for-tat moves that are doing more harm than good.

It was the morning of September 20th, 2021. The sun had barely risen over the horizon, and the air was thick with anticipation and excitement. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi had boarded his flight to the United States, where he would meet American President Joe Biden and participate in a series of high-level meetings and events aimed at deepening the ties between the world's two largest democracies.
The visit was much-awaited, with many hoping that it would provide an opportunity for the two leaders to reset and strengthen their relationship after a somewhat tumultuous few years. While the two countries have always had a complicated relationship with each other, many believe that there is a renewed sense of urgency to get the relationship back on track, given the changing geopolitical landscape in the region.

It's hard to imagine a world without music. From classical symphonies to pop ballads, music has the power to move us, soothe us, and lift our spirits. But have you ever stopped to think about where the instruments that make that music come from?
Take the clarinet, for instance. This woodwind instrument is essential to many musical genres, including jazz and classical. But did you know that the wood used to make many high-quality clarinets comes from a specific species of tree called Mpingo?

Incidents like these are not new in football.

Similarly, during the 2013 Confederations Cup semi-final between Brazil and Uruguay, Luis Suarez, the Uruguayan striker, bit the shoulder of Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini, which led to a lengthy ban for Suarez.

As the world watched with bated breath, China made a bold move. It decided to annex Taiwan, using force if necessary. This move was met with outrage by the international community, particularly the United States.
The topic of sanctioning China in the event of a crisis in Taiwan has been a hot button issue for quite some time.

Once upon a time, Saudi Arabia and Iran were considered as allies in the Middle East. However, the friendship turned into rivalry which further intensified and became a regional cold war. This cold war has impacted the entire West Asian region, and its effects can be seen in the current geopolitical landscape.
Saudi Arabia and Iran have been at loggerheads for various reasons. One of the most significant reasons is Sunni-Shia tensions resulting from their differing interpretations of Islam. Additionally, the two countries have political and economic differences as well, with oil playing a significant role. For instance, Saudi Arabia has historically been the leading producer of oil, and Iran is the fourth-largest producer. They both seek to control oil prices and markets, leading to a severe rivalry. Furthermore, geopolitical power struggles influence their relationships, as Iran seeks to become a regional power while Saudi Arabia seeks to maintain its dominant power position.

Biden's message of support for India's democratic and pluralistic values was well received by many people around the world. However, his indirect nudge for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to address human rights issues in India has sparked a lot of attention and debates.
Human rights are universal, inalienable and indivisible. The protection of human rights is essential in maintaining peace, security and stability in the world. It is no longer an internal matter of any country, but a global concern. In this context, it is essential to promote human rights as a key component of foreign policy and diplomacy. Diplomatic relations should be based on the respect for human rights, democracy, and rule of law.

As the world grows more interconnected, the role of global superpowers and their relationships with each other become more important than ever. In this context, the recent shift in the Washington Consensus and its implications on India-US relations cannot be ignored. Let's explore why.
The Washington Consensus was a set of policies and principles that the US government and international organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank advocated for as solutions to global economic problems, primarily in the developing world. This old consensus emphasized deregulation, privatization, and liberalization of trade, among other things.

It was a beautiful Sunday morning, the sky was clear and blue, and the sun was shining bright. After a long week, I decided to take a walk in the park to clear my mind. As I walked, I noticed something strange. Everyone was rushing around, talking on their phones, or listening to music. Nobody was actually enjoying the beautiful day. I felt sorry for them because they were missing out on the beauty that was right in front of them.
I decided to put my phone away and just be present in the moment. I took in the fresh air, felt the warmth of the sun on my skin, and listened to the birds chirping. It was then that I realized the magic of living in the moment. I felt relaxed, and my mind was clear. I was truly happy.

Have you ever heard the phrase ""what you focus on expands?"" It's a phrase that may seem overused or cliche, but it's so true. Think about the last time you woke up feeling down and out of sorts. Maybe you had a fight with someone the night before or slept poorly. How was the rest of your day? Did it seem like one bad thing after another kept happening?
Now think about how it feels to wake up feeling energized and excited. Maybe you have a big project at work that you're looking forward to, or you're planning a weekend getaway with friends. How does the rest of your day go? Do things seem to fall into place?

Once upon a time, in an era of globalization, India and the United States decided to come together and strengthen their alliance. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Washington is yet another feather in the cap of India-US strategic partnership. During his week-long visit, Modi will hold meetings with President Joe Biden and other top officials. The key agenda includes strategic partnerships in climate change, trade, and defense. The talks will focus on a range of issues, including oil, arms, and India's sovereignty.
India has a huge appetite for energy and imports almost 80% of its crude oil requirements. The US has been a significant supplier of crude oil to India. According to the US Energy Information Administration, the US was India's fourth-largest crude oil supplier in 2020. Apart from crude oil, India also imports natural gas from the US. During his visit, Modi is likely to discuss increased energy cooperation to ensure stable and affordable energy prices.

Once upon a time, a young politician named Giorgia Meloni rose to power in Italy. She was charismatic, ambitious and had a clear vision of how she wanted to transform the country. Meloni presented herself as a defender of national identity, conservative values and economic liberalism. She embraced an anti-immigrant stance and promised to put 'Italians first'. Her rhetoric resonated with many voters who were disillusioned with traditional parties and challenged by globalisation.
However, Meloni soon discovered that her agenda faced significant obstacles, both domestically and internationally. She realised that her vision of Italy was not only shaped by her own ideology, but also by larger forces that she could not control. Neoliberalism and geopolitics were influencing her policies, even if she did not fully understand or acknowledge their impact. This article explores how Meloni's political trajectory reflects the wider tensions between neoliberalism and geopolitics, and how ideology can be both a product and a tool of those tensions.

One day, a group of men in military uniforms came into the village and told the people to evacuate immediately. They said that Iran was planning to bomb the village and that they had received credible intelligence. The villagers quickly gathered their belongings and left the village. As they were leaving, they saw Iranian fighter jets flying over their village.
This story is just one example of how Iran's aggressive behavior can impact neighboring countries. India and the US should not ignore the Iran threat any longer.

Investing in China can be a double-edged sword for many U.S. allocators. On one hand, China's booming economy and billion-strong population offer lucrative investment opportunities. On the other hand, the country's political and regulatory risks can be daunting.
Emily, a portfolio manager at a U.S. pension fund, was excited to visit China in 2019 to explore new investment opportunities. She met with Chinese executives, visited factories, and saw the country's impressive growth firsthand. Over the next year, her fund invested heavily in Chinese stocks, particularly in the technology sector. However, tensions between the U.S. and China escalated, and the Chinese government began cracking down on tech companies. In 2021, Emily's fund lost millions as their Chinese investments plummeted.

The US-India relationship has grown significantly and has the potential to impact not only the two countries' economies but also the political dynamics of neighboring regions. Let me tell you a story.
Once upon a time, India was under pressure from its neighboring country China, as the latter tried to assert its dominance in the region. But the US saw India as a strategic ally in countering China's growing influence. The US provided training to India's military, while India opened up its markets to US companies. This was the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

He wanted to feel the emotions of the supporters, to understand how they experienced the match, and to learn from their reactions.

China has been a manufacturing powerhouse for decades, and many multinationals have relied on China's massive workforce and favorable policies to produce goods at a low cost. However, in recent years, there has been a shift in this trend, as companies realize that there are several disadvantages to doing business in China.

As a child, Arjun had always dreamt of becoming a soldier. He was fascinated by the stories he had heard about the valour and bravery of Indian soldiers. He idolized men in uniform and hoped to join the Indian Army one day. His dreams came true when he cleared the selection process and was inducted as a soldier in the Indian Army. He underwent intense training and was finally ready to serve his country from the border. But little did he know that his duty would involve facing hostile situations from across the border. He soon learnt that protecting the country was not an easy task, especially with the frequent skirmishes with neighbours and the perpetual terrorist threat.

After working in finance for five years, Yang decided to quit her job and pursue her love for coffee. She enrolled in a barista training program in Guangzhou, where she learned about the intricacies of brewing and serving coffee. She now works as a barista in a cafe in Shanghai, where she can satisfy her passion for coffee and interact with customers, something she couldn't do behind a desk in an office.
