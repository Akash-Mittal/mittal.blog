    <p>Meet John, a software engineer from India who has been working in the United States on an H-1B visa for the past five years. John has been patiently waiting to apply for permanent residency through his employer, who has filed an EB-3 petition on his behalf. However, according to the July 2023 Visa Bulletin, John's priority date has retrogressed steeply, which means his wait time will be extended significantly.</p>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>John is not alone in this situation. Many other employment-based petitioners and beneficiaries are affected by the July 2023 Visa Bulletin.</p>
    <ol>
     <li><strong>EB-1 China and India:</strong> No movement since the last bulletin, remaining at June 1, 2021.</li>
     <li><strong>EB-2 China and India:</strong> Minimal advancement, moving to March 1, 2022.</li>
     <li><strong>EB-3 China:</strong> Minor advancement, moving to January 1, 2022.</li>
     <li><strong>EB-3 India:</strong> Significant retrogression, moving back to January 1, 2019.</li>
     <li><strong>EB-3 Philippines:</strong> Moderate retrogression, moving back to May 1, 2019.</li>
     <li><strong>EB-3 Rest of World and Mexico:</strong> Moderate retrogression, moving back to August 1, 2021.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These changes will have a significant impact on individuals and businesses whose permanent residency applications rely on these categories.</p>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The July 2023 Visa Bulletin brings disappointment for those hoping for progress in their permanent residency applications. The retrogression of certain categories highlights the need for immigration reform to address backlogs and provide more opportunities for skilled foreign workers seeking to contribute to the United States economy. Until then, petitioners and beneficiaries will have to continue to navigate the prolonged wait times and uncertainty of the current system.</p>
