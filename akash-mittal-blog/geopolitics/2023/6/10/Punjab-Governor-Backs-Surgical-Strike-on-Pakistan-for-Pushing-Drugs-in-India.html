   <h3>How Pakistan's Drug Smuggling is Making India's Youth Vulnerable to Addiction</h3>

   <section>
    <p>It is a well-known fact that drugs are a menace to society and the younger generation is more vulnerable to it. India has been facing a drug epidemic and one of its originating sources is from our neighboring country Pakistan. Punjab Governor Shriban Purohit has recently backed India's 'surgical strike' on Pakistan for pushing drugs into the country.</p>
    <p>Pakistan has been using different ways such as via air, sea and land to smuggle drugs into India. They have been successful in doing this as the drug route from Pakistan to India is not only the cheapest but also the safest in the world. The drugs eventually reach the hands of youth and drugs such as 'chitta' (heroin laced with caffeine or other powders) and 'ice' (crystal meth) are leading to an exponential growth of addiction in Punjab.</p>
    <h2>Case Studies:</h2>
    <p>A recent study by a Punjab University Professor has shown that over 60% of Punjab's youth is in the grip of drug addiction. The same study also revealed that heroin was the most favored drug among the youth, with synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) being the second and third most popular drug respectively.</p>
    <p>Clinics such as the Guru Nanak Mission Hospital in Jalandhar and other de-addiction centers in Punjab have also seen a rise in patients. Out of all the patients admitted in these centers, a staggering 80% are between the ages of 15 and 35. These patients come from all strata of society, including middle-class and rich families.</p>
    <p>The younger generation is the most affected by this drug influx from Pakistan. The situation is so bad that the students have started to attend classes under the influence of drugs. The increase in addiction among the students has led to a decrease in the average academic performance, and in some cases, the inability to attend classes altogether. The students who are addicted to drugs opt for dropout or face expulsion from the school.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p>Drug addiction is a major problem that is rapidly growing in India, especially among the youth. The drug trafficking from Pakistan is making things worse and endangering the lives of many young individuals in India. The need of the hour is for a joint effort by both India and Pakistan to put an end to this menace of drug smuggling.</p>
    <p>India needs to take strict action against the drug lords, while Pakistan should take measures to restrict drug smuggling. The awareness of the issue should be raised and de-addiction centers should be opened to provide assistance to those affected by drug addiction. The government needs to prioritize this issue and work towards protecting its youth from this epidemic of drug addiction.</p>
