  <h2>The Story of Gadar</h2>
  <p>Gadar is a story of Tara Singh (Sunny Deol), a fearless Sikh who falls in love with a Muslim girl, Sakina (Ameesha Patel), during the tumultuous time of Partition India. The two lovers face brutal opposition from society, who see their relationship as a betrayal to their respective religions. The story takes a dramatic turn when Sakina's family decides to return to Pakistan during the Partition riots, and Tara takes it upon himself to rescue his love from the clutches of her abductors.</p>
  <h2>The Success of Gadar</h2>
  <p>Gadar was a massive hit in India and abroad, breaking many box office records.

The movie struck a chord with audiences who were yearning for a hero who could stand up against the enemy.</p>
