   <main><!--Start of Introduction-->
    <p>The recent economic crisis in Pakistan has led to the government showing interest in joining the BRICS group. BRICS, an economic bloc that includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, was formed on June 16, 2009. South Africa was the only country to join the bloc after its formation in December 2010. The group represents about 42% of the world's population and has a combined GDP of around $16 trillion.</p><!--End of Introduction--> <!--Start of Story-->
    
    <p>Once upon a time, there was a small business owner in Pakistan who was struggling to keep his business afloat. He had invested all his savings and taken out loans to fund his business, but due to the economic crisis, he was not making enough profits to pay off his debts. He began to look for a solution to his problem and stumbled upon the BRICS group.</p>
    <p>After doing his research, he discovered that joining the BRICS group could benefit his business in many ways. The group had a large market with a growing middle class and a high demand for products and services. This was exactly the kind of market he needed to expand his business and increase his profits. He also found out that the BRICS group had a development bank that could provide loans at lower interest rates compared to the traditional banks in Pakistan.</p>
    <p>The business owner decided to take a chance and applied to join the BRICS group. After a thorough evaluation process, his application was accepted, and he became a member of the group. He was now able to export his products to other BRICS countries, get loans from the development bank and access new markets. His business started to grow, and he was able to pay off his debts and even expand his business further.</p><!--End of Story--> <!--Start of Examples-->
    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <h3>Case Study 1: The Effect of BRICS Membership on the Brazilian Economy</h3>
    <p>When Brazil joined the BRICS group in 2009, its economy was struggling. The country was facing high inflation, low growth, and a weak currency. However, after joining the group, Brazil's economy started to recover. The country was able to export more to other BRICS countries and access new markets. The BRICS development bank also provided loans at lower interest rates, which helped the Brazilian government fund infrastructure projects and stimulate economic growth. Today, Brazil is one of the largest economies in the world and a key member of the BRICS group.</p>
    <h3>Case Study 2: The Effect of BRICS Membership on the Indian Automotive Industry</h3>
    <p>When India joined the BRICS group in 2009, the country's automotive industry was facing tough competition from foreign companies. However, after joining the group, the Indian automotive industry was able to access new markets and grow its exports. The development bank also provided loans to Indian automakers at lower interest rates, which helped them invest in new technologies and improve their products. Today, Indian automakers are some of the largest players in the global automotive industry, and India is a key member of the BRICS group.</p><!--End of Examples--> <!--Start of Conclusion-->

However, becoming a member of the BRICS group requires a thorough evaluation process, and Pakistan would need to meet certain economic and political criteria.
