  <h1>An EU Plan to ‘De-Risk' Investment in China Meets Resistance</h1></br> <img src="images/EU-s-De-Risking-Plan-for-China.jpeg" alt="+EU-s-De-Risking-Plan-for-China+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3223619/eus-de-risking-plan-china-meets-resistance-some-members" target="_blank" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3223619/eus-de-risking-plan-china-meets-resistance-some-members" rel="noopener">https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3223619/eus-de-risking-plan-china-meets-resistance-some-members</a></span></h5>
  <p>Investing in China can be a risky proposition. Companies face challenges ranging from bureaucratic obstacles to intellectual property theft to political instability. Yet, despite these risks, many companies are still drawn to China's huge market and rapid growth.</p>
  <p>That's why the European Union proposed a "de-risking" plan in early 2020. The plan aimed to reduce some of the risks of investing in China by creating new rules and mechanisms to protect European companies.</p>
  <h2>What is the EU's de-risking plan for China?</h2>
  <p>The EU's de-risking plan has several components. One key component is a new framework for investment screening. The EU plans to create a new system that will allow member states to vet foreign investments—especially investments from China—in certain strategic sectors such as technology and infrastructure.</p>
  <p>The EU also plans to create new rules to make it harder for Chinese companies to buy European firms that have valuable intellectual property. These new rules would give EU regulators more power to block such transactions.</p>
  <p>In addition, the EU wants to take a coordinated approach to dealing with China in international fora. This would include working together to address issues such as intellectual property theft and human rights abuses.</p>
  <h2>Why is the de-risking plan controversial?</h2>
  <p>The EU's de-risking plan has faced resistance from several western European states, who argue that the plan is too confrontational and could damage their economic ties with China. These states—including Germany and Italy—are concerned that the plan could spark a trade war with China and hurt European businesses that rely on China for manufacturing or exports.</p>
  <p>Others argue that the plan doesn't go far enough. They point out that several EU member states have already signed up to China's Belt and Road Initiative—the massive infrastructure investment program that aims to connect China with the rest of the world. They believe that these member states will continue to prioritize their economic ties with China over any concerns about security or human rights abuses.</p>
  <h2>Case studies: Companies face risks in China</h2>
  <p>Several recent high-profile cases illustrate the risks that companies face in China.</p>
  <p>One example is German carmaker Volkswagen, which has been forced to apologize and pay compensation to Chinese customers over faulty gearboxes. The incident highlights the difficulties that foreign firms can face in dealing with China's opaque legal system and unsympathetic regulators.</p>
  <p>Another example is French retailer Carrefour, which was forced to sell its Chinese business to a local company in 2019. The sale came after years of declining sales and challenges from local competitors, including Alibaba.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion: A delicate balancing act</h2>
  <p>The EU's de-risking plan for China is a delicate balancing act. On one hand, European companies face real risks in China—risks that can include everything from intellectual property theft to political pressure. On the other hand, some member states are concerned about the potential economic costs of confronting China.</p>
  <p>Ultimately, the success of the plan will depend on how well the EU can navigate these competing interests. The EU will need to find a way to protect its companies while maintaining its economic ties with China—and without sparking a trade war or damaging Europe's broader relationships in Asia and beyond.</p>
