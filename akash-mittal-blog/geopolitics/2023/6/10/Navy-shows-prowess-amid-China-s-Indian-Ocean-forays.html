  <p>In recent years, tension has been prevailing between India and China along the northern borders. The Indian Navy has now carried out its first exercise with two new aircraft carriers – INS Vikramaditya and INS Vikrant – along with 35 aircraft and other warships to demonstrate its maritime muscles in the Indian Ocean region. This exercise showcases the power projection in the Arabian Sea with the help of MiG-29K fighter jets.</p>
  <h2>Examples of the Indian Navy's Prowess</h2>
  <p>Over the years, the Indian Navy has shown exemplary strength and resilience in the Indian Ocean region. Some notable examples include:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The Indian Navy successfully foiled a piracy attempt in the Gulf of Aden in 2011. INS Tabar, a stealth frigate, managed to sink a Somali pirate vessel.</li>
   <li>During the 2015 Nepal earthquake, the Indian Navy was instrumental in the evacuation of over 2,000 people from Nepal. INS Mumbai and INS Tarkash assisted in the rescue operations.</li>
   <li>Last year, INS Jalashwa, an amphibious transport dock, evacuated over 700 stranded Indian nationals from the Maldives during the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>One of the most significant events in the Indian Navy's history was during the 1971 Indo-Pakistan War. The Indian Navy played a pivotal role in thwarting Pakistan's attempt to attack India's western shores. The attack, codenamed 'Operation Trident,' involved the deployment of three missile boats – INS Nipat, INS Nirghat and INS Veer.</p>
  <p>Recently, the Indian Navy was involved in joint exercises with the US Navy in the Bay of Bengal. The exercise, called 'Malabar 2020,' aimed at enhancing interoperability between the two navies and included complex maritime movements and anti-submarine drills.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The Indian Navy's recent exercises with two new aircraft carriers demonstrate its commitment to maintaining security in the Indian Ocean region. The Navy has proved its strength and resilience over the years, and their involvement in joint exercises with other navies will only enhance their capabilities. As India's ambitions grow with regards to security in the region, the Indian Navy will continue to play a critical role.</p>
