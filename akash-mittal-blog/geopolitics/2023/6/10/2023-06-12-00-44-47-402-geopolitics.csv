"2023-06-12 01:10 AM;","Education is one of the most important tools that a country can use to empower its people. From improving employability to imparting valuable life skills, education can pave the way for a brighter future. However, not all schools succeed in their quest to educate their students. One such example is the Pakistan High Commission School in India, which recently shut down due to low enrollment levels.
According to reports, the Pakistan High Commission School in India was shut down due to low enrollment levels. Despite being funded by the Government of Pakistan, the school struggled to attract students, resulting in its closure. This is a common issue that many schools face, especially in underprivileged areas where parents cannot afford to send their children to school.
Another common issue that schools face is the lack of infrastructure. Without proper facilities, students will struggle to learn and may not perform well in their exams. This was the case in the Pakistan High Commission School. Despite having dedicated teachers, the school lacked basic facilities such as computers and libraries, which made it difficult for students to keep up with their studies.
Finally, political tensions between Pakistan and India may have affected the functioning of the school. In recent years, tensions between the two countries have been high, which may have made it difficult for Pakistani students to attend school in India. This could have resulted in low enrollment levels, which ultimately led to the closure of the school.
There are many factors that can contribute to the success or failure of a school. While a lack of funding can sometimes be a problem, other issues such as low enrollment levels and a lack of infrastructure can also contribute. In the case of the Pakistan High Commission School, a combination of factors led to its closure. However, it is important to remember that education is key to empowering individuals and societies.

"2023-06-12 01:20 AM;","Imagine waking up one day to find out that your teenage daughter is missing, only to later discover that she has been abducted, forcibly converted to a religion she did not believe in, and then married off to a stranger â€“ all without your knowledge or consent. This is the reality that many families of minority communities in Pakistan are facing today.
The case of Suha, a 14-year-old Hindu girl from Sindh province, is not an isolated incident. In fact, it is just one of the many cases that are being reported in Pakistan where girls from minority communities such as Hindus, Christians, and Sikhs are being abducted, forcefully converted, and married off to Muslim men.
According to a report published by the Movement for Solidarity and Peace in Pakistan, an estimated 1,000 Christian and Hindu girls are abducted, forcibly converted, and married off annually in Pakistan. These numbers are confirmed by several human rights organizations such as the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan and the International Crisis Group.
Such cases have devastating effects on the lives of the girls who are abducted and their families. Here are a few examples of how these forced conversions and marriages have affected the lives of some of the girls:
These case studies illustrate the urgent need for action to be taken to protect the rights of minority communities in Pakistan. The authorities need to take stringent measures to prevent such abductions, forced conversions, and marriages from taking place. Religious leaders also need to be more actively involved in creating awareness about the importance of respecting the religious beliefs of others.

"2023-06-12 01:40 AM;","Cricket is more than just a sport in the Indian subcontinent. It is a religion, a way of life. The Asia Cup, a biennial tournament that features the best of Asian cricketing nations, is a highly anticipated event. However, the impasse over the Asia Cup 2023 venue has left cricket fans disappointed. The absence of either India or Pakistan from the tournament is a lose-lose situation for everyone involved.
The Asian Cricket Council (ACC) was supposed to hold the Asia Cup 2023 in Pakistan. However, given the tense political climate between India and Pakistan, the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) refused to send the Indian team to Pakistan. The BCCI cited security concerns for their refusal. Pakistan responded by stating that they would refuse to play the tournament in any other country than their own. This impasse has left the future of the Asia Cup 2023 uncertain.
The absence of India and Pakistan from the Asia Cup is a huge blow for cricket fans. These two nations have a long-standing rivalry, and their matches always generate high viewership and ticket sales. The Asia Cup would have been a perfect platform for these two cricketing giants to face off against each other. However, with neither team participating, fans will be robbed of one of the most exciting aspects of the tournament.
The absence of India and Pakistan from the Asia Cup affects everyone involved in several ways:
India and Pakistan are two of the biggest cricketing nations in the world. Their absence from the tournament will lead to a significant reduction in viewership and ticket sales. The organizers of the Asia Cup stand to lose a substantial amount of revenue as a result.

"2023-06-12 01:50 AM;","Bangladesh is one of the fastest-growing economies in South Asia with a rising middle class and a strategic location in the Indo-Pacific region. China has been investing heavily in its infrastructure projects to increase Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) connectivity. On the other hand, the United States has been investing in the country's human development and good governance. Bangladesh is caught in the middle of great power rivalry, and it is trying to balance its relationship with both nations to maintain economic development, sovereignty, and political stability.
In recent years, Bangladesh has been cautiously aligning itself with both the United States and China. It is investing in infrastructure development with Chinese funding, and at the same time, it is sourcing armed equipment from the United States for security purposes. Bangladesh is successfully conducting an independent foreign policy and is trying to avoid becoming a pawn in the geopolitical agenda of the two superpowers.
China is Bangladesh's largest trading partner. Bangladesh has signed Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) on comprehensive partnership and investment cooperation with China in recent years. Jointly, they are investing billions of dollars in infrastructure development in Bangladesh, including roads, bridges, LNG terminals, power plants, and seaports. Special Economic Zones (SEZs) have also been established in Bangladesh with Chinese funding, intending to boost trade and economic development. Bangladesh is considered a significant component in China's BRI, which encompasses nearly 70 countries.
The United States is also a significant contributor to Bangladesh's economic growth. Bangladesh has been the largest beneficiary of the United States Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) since its launch in 1976. Bangladesh exports ready-made garments, jute, and textiles to the United States. The country is also the largest recipient of US aid in South Asia, focusing on good governance, human development, and social progress. The United States is also encouraging American companies to invest in Bangladesh in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, education, and renewable energy.
Bangladesh and the United States have a history of security cooperation, which has increased in recent years. The United States has delivered military equipment to Bangladesh worth millions of dollars. It has provided training to Bangladesh's military, navy, and air force. The United States has been working closely with Bangladesh to counter terrorism and radicalism. Bangladesh has played a critical role in China's security agenda in the region by providing support in issues related to Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the South China Sea. Bangladesh also participated in the first-ever China-Africa Defense and Security Forum in Beijing in 2018.

Fans around the world were eagerly waiting for the match to start, hoping to see one of the most competitive cricket series in recent years.
India had a great start to the match, dismissing the top order of the Australian team cheaply. Fans and experts alike were impressed with the way India was playing and the fielding standard they displayed. But something changed after the first hour of the game.
Former Pakistani cricketer and commentator Basit Ali was analyzing the match as he saw how India surrendered their dominance over the game to Australia. In an interview, he said, ""India lost the match they moment they opted to field first after worrying about the overcast conditions.""
Basit Ali, who has played against the Indian team during his time, is known for his outspoken nature and fearless analysis of the game. He didn't hold back with his criticism of India's head coach Rahul Dravid.

The use of drones for illegal activities such as smuggling and surveillance is a growing concern, and it requires immediate action. While preventive measures can be taken by the government and law enforcement agencies, it is equally important for individuals to be aware of the risks associated with drone use and report any suspicious activity to the authorities. Only then can we combat the misuse of this technology and ensure public safety and national security.

"2023-06-12 02:20 AM;","In the world of espionage and intelligence, rumors and stories often circulate. One such story recently cropped up, claiming that China is setting up a spy base in Cuba. While the reports have been circulating for a while, it was only recently that they caught public attention. The United States, which has always been known for its watchful eyes in the region, has cast doubts on the story. However, it raises important questions about the rise of China's global intelligence networks.
The report claiming China would establish a spy base in Cuba was first published in an Australian newspaper. The report suggested that China was working with the Cuban government to build an electronic intelligence facility that would help the country gather intelligence from the United States. The report came with a map showing the alleged location of the base in the southern Cuban province of Cienfuegos.
The report was also accompanied by details about the types of technologies and equipment that the base would use, including underwater surveillance systems and listening devices that could intercept communications being transmitted through the airwaves and under the sea. The report suggested that the base would be operational by 2020.
The United States and Cuba have both reacted to the report, albeit in different ways. The United States has voiced its concerns about the possibility of China establishing a spy base in Cuba. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby issued a statement dismissing the report as incorrect but acknowledged that the US has had ""real concerns"" about China's relationship with Cuba.
Cuba, on the other hand, has dismissed the report as baseless. Alejandro Castro EspÃ­n, the son of former Cuban leader RaÃºl Castro, tweeted that the report was part of a ""tired campaign against Cuba"" and that the island would continue its ""autonomous policy"".

"2023-06-12 02:30 AM;","The news of China planning to build its first overseas military base in Cuba has sent shockwaves across the international community. While Chinese officials have downplayed the possibility of setting up a full-scale military base, the proposed location of the facility has raised concerns in the United States. According to intelligence sources, China is eyeing a site near the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, which would give it an advantageous position to spy on U.S. communication signals.
China has long been one of Cuba's biggest trading partners and investors, with the two countries enjoying a strong diplomatic relationship. In recent years, China has stepped up its presence in Latin America, seeking to expand its economic and political influence in the region. Cuba, with its strategic location and historical ties to China, is a key component in Beijing's ""One Belt, One Road"" initiative, which aims to build a modern-day Silk Road connecting China to Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.
China's interest in Cuba is not new. In fact, China has been involved in a number of major infrastructure projects in Cuba, including the expansion of the Havana International Airport and the construction of the Mariel Special Economic Development Zone. However, the proposed military base would mark a new level of engagement for China, putting it in direct competition with the United States in the Caribbean.
Signals intelligence, or SIGINT, is the interception and analysis of communication signals for intelligence purposes. It is a critical component of modern warfare, providing valuable information on enemy movements, intentions, capabilities, and vulnerabilities. The United States has one of the most advanced SIGINT capabilities in the world, with a network of satellite, airborne, and ground-based sensors capable of intercepting and analyzing a wide range of signals.
China's interest in setting up a spy base near Guantanamo Bay is likely driven by its desire to gain access to U.S. SIGINT. By intercepting and analyzing U.S. communication signals, China could gain valuable intelligence on U.S. military operations, technology, and capabilities. This could help China to better understand U.S. military strategy, develop countermeasures, and potentially gain a strategic advantage in any future conflict.

"2023-06-12 02:40 AM;","The Arabian Sea, a popular destination for tourists, has recently been experiencing a severe cyclonic storm known as Biparjoy. This storm has posed a significant threat to the coastal regions of India and Pakistan, especially Jakhau port.
The impact of Cyclonic Storm Biparjoy on India and Pakistan can be witnessed through various case studies, such as:
Jakhau Port is a popular port region located in the Kutch district of Gujarat, India. It is the only all-weather direct berthing deep-sea port in the country. However, due to the storm, the port witnessed a severe downfall in business activities, resulting in a loss of revenue. The port also faced issues with transportation and logistics due to the disruption of road and rail services.
The fishing industry in Pakistan has been significantly impacted due to the Cyclonic Storm Biparjoy. Thousands of fishermen in the coastal regions were asked to suspend all fishing activities as the sea remained perilous due to high tides. This led to losses for the fishermen who depend on daily income for their livelihood.
The cyclonic storm caused massive damage to infrastructure in the affected areas of India and Pakistan. Road networks were destroyed, leading to transportation issues and communication disruption. The storm also caused power outages, which affected millions of people in the affected areas.

However, in recent years, there have been several instances of ball tampering that have tarnished the reputation of the game. The latest controversy involves Australia, who are accused of playing with the ball during their recent match with India.
Ex-Pakistani cricketer Basit Ali has made a shocking claim that the Australians tampered with the ball during their match against India. Speaking on his YouTube channel, Ali pointed out how the Aussies 'made the ball' around the 15th over and that helped them get rid of India's Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara.
Ball tampering is a serious offence in cricket. It involves altering the condition of the ball using foreign objects like sandpaper, nails, or bottle caps in order to gain an unfair advantage. There have been several instances of ball tampering in the history of cricket, some of which have caused major controversies and led to severe punishments.
The most infamous case of ball tampering in recent years is the Sandpaper Gate involving the Australian cricket team. The incident occurred during the third Test against South Africa in Cape Town in March 2018. Cameron Bancroft, who was fielding at the time, was caught on camera using sandpaper to alter the condition of the ball. The revelation led to a huge uproar, and the Australian captain Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner were stripped of their positions. Bancroft was also banned for nine months, while Smith and Warner were banned for a year each.
In 2006, the Pakistan cricket team was accused of ball tampering during a Test match against England. The team's captain, Inzamam-ul-Haq, refused to take the field after the umpires awarded five penalty runs to England and changed the ball. It was later revealed that a member of the Pakistan team had used a bottle cap to tamper with the ball. The incident led to a lot of drama, and the match had to be forfeited by Pakistan.

"2023-06-12 03:10 AM;","Investing in China can be a risky proposition. Companies face challenges ranging from bureaucratic obstacles to intellectual property theft to political instability. Yet, despite these risks, many companies are still drawn to China's huge market and rapid growth.
That's why the European Union proposed a ""de-risking"" plan in early 2020. The plan aimed to reduce some of the risks of investing in China by creating new rules and mechanisms to protect European companies.
The EU's de-risking plan has several components. One key component is a new framework for investment screening. The EU plans to create a new system that will allow member states to vet foreign investmentsâ€”especially investments from Chinaâ€”in certain strategic sectors such as technology and infrastructure.
The EU also plans to create new rules to make it harder for Chinese companies to buy European firms that have valuable intellectual property. These new rules would give EU regulators more power to block such transactions.
In addition, the EU wants to take a coordinated approach to dealing with China in international fora. This would include working together to address issues such as intellectual property theft and human rights abuses.

"2023-06-12 03:20 AM;","Basit Ali, the former Pakistani cricketer, has recently raised questions about the coaching abilities of Indian cricket legend Rahul Dravid. In an interview with a news channel after the World Test Championship (WTC) final, Basit Ali expressed his disappointment with Team India's performance and the tactics used by the team management.
This is not the first time that Basit Ali has questioned the Indian team. However, his latest remarks have stirred up a controversy in the cricketing world. Many Indian fans and ex-players have criticized Basit Ali for his comments, while others have defended his right to express his opinions.
Basit Ali's criticism of Team India's tactics is derived from the team management's decision to play two spinners in the WTC final. Many experts had predicted that the seam-friendly conditions in Southampton would favor India's fast bowlers. However, the team management decided to go with two spinners, who failed to make an impact in the match. Basit Ali believes that this decision was a major factor in India's loss to New Zealand in the final.
Another aspect of Basit Ali's criticism is directed towards Rahul Dravid's coaching abilities. Dravid, who has recently taken over as the head coach of the Indian team, is regarded as one of the greatest batsmen to have played the game. However, Basit Ali questions whether Dravid has the skills and experience to coach a team at the highest level. He believes that Dravid's lack of coaching experience may be a hindrance to the team's success.
While Basit Ali's comments may seem harsh, they do raise some valid points. There have been instances in the past where the Indian team's tactics and team selection have been criticized by experts and fans alike. Similarly, while Dravid is highly respected in the cricketing world, there are concerns about his lack of coaching experience.

Ali was particularly unhappy with Dravid's decision to play two spinners in overcast and seam-friendly conditions at the Ageas Bowl in Southampton, England.
According to Ali, India did not have the right balance in their side and should have gone with an extra pacer instead of Ravindra Jadeja, who only managed to take one wicket in the match. Ali also questioned Dravid's strategy of promoting Jadeja up the order in India's second innings, which did not pay off as Jadeja was dismissed cheaply.
This is not the first time that Ali has criticized the Indian team. In the past, he has accused them of being too defensive in their approach and lacking the killer instinct needed to win big matches.
Ali's comments have sparked a debate among cricket enthusiasts, with some supporting his viewpoint and others disagreeing with it. However, there is no denying that Dravid's tactics in the WTC final have come under scrutiny after India's disappointing performance, which ended in a defeat by eight wickets.
While it is easy to criticize after the fact, it is important to understand the thought process behind Dravid's decisions. The conditions on the first day of the match were not as hostile as they were on the second and third days, when the ball started to move around more. The presence of two spinners allowed India to keep the run rate under control and build pressure on New Zealand's batsmen. However, the plan did not work as well as expected, as New Zealand's lower order managed to score crucial runs in both innings.

"2023-06-12 03:40 AM;","Politics in Pakistan has always been marred by the military's interference and control. In the recent years, however, a new player has come to the scene â€“ Imran Khan. A former cricketer turned politician, Imran Khan has been the darling of Pakistan's military establishment for some time now. However, as the saying goes, ""power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely"". In the case of Imran Khan and the Pakistani military, it was a failed experiment resulting in a Frankenstein's monster that they couldn't control anymore.
Pakistan's military has a long history of involvement in the country's politics. Since its inception in 1947, Pakistan has had several military coups and periods of military rule. The military's interference in politics is not limited to coups and martial law alone. It has also been involved in the selection of political leaders, formation of governments and policy-making. This interference has resulted in weakening Pakistan's democratic institutions and governance.
The military's justification for its involvement is often that it is the only institution capable of ensuring the country's stability and national security. However, this argument has been undermined by the military's own actions, which have often resulted in further instability and insecurity.
Imran Khan entered politics in the late 1990s with the establishment of his political party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (Pakistan Movement for Justice or PTI). His initial foray into politics was met with little success, and he remained on the fringes of Pakistani politics for most of the next two decades. However, his fortunes changed in the run-up to the 2013 elections, where his anti-corruption rhetoric and promise of a ""Naya Pakistan"" (New Pakistan) resonated with a younger generation of Pakistani voters.
Although PTI emerged as the second largest party in the 2013 elections, it failed to form a government. However, Imran Khan's popularity continued to grow, and he was seen as a viable alternative to the traditional political parties such as the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan People's Party (PPP).

"2023-06-12 03:50 AM;","I still remember the day when I first watched Gadar. It was a hot summer afternoon, and my cousins and I had bunked school to catch the movie on its opening day. Little did I know that the movie would make such an impact on me and the Indian cinema industry.
Gadar is a story of Tara Singh (Sunny Deol), a fearless Sikh who falls in love with a Muslim girl, Sakina (Ameesha Patel), during the tumultuous time of Partition India. The two lovers face brutal opposition from society, who see their relationship as a betrayal to their respective religions. The story takes a dramatic turn when Sakina's family decides to return to Pakistan during the Partition riots, and Tara takes it upon himself to rescue his love from the clutches of her abductors.
Gadar was a massive hit in India and abroad, breaking many box office records. The movie's success can be attributed to its powerful storyline, the sizzling chemistry between Sunny Deol and Ameesha Patel, and the timely release in the aftermath of the Kargil War between India and Pakistan. The movie struck a chord with audiences who were yearning for a hero who could stand up against the enemy.
Gadar's success paved the way for many other movies that celebrated patriotism and nationalism. Movies like Lagaan, Border, and Rang De Basanti owe their success to the template first set by Gadar.
Gadar continues to be relevant today, where India and Pakistan are still engaged in a diplomatic war. The movie serves as a reminder of the futility of war and the importance of love and unity.

"2023-06-12 04:00 AM;","China's market remains quite important to most German companies and many are willing to increase investment in the country to remain competitive and leverage their potential, according to the German Chamber of Commerce in China.
German companies have been present in China for decades, attracted by the country's large and growing consumer base, as well as its relatively low labor costs and favorable business environment.
However, in recent years, the China market has become increasingly competitive, with the rise of domestic players and other foreign firms. To stay ahead of the game and continue to grow, many German companies are now looking to increase their investments in China.
Bosch, a leading global supplier of technology and services, has been operating in China for over 100 years. In recent years, it has made significant investments in the country, including the opening of new factories and research and development centers.
One of its latest projects is the construction of a new mobility solutions plant in the eastern Chinese city of Wuhu, which will have an annual production capacity of one million electric powertrains for use in electric and hybrid vehicles.

"2023-06-12 04:10 AM;","It was a bright and sunny day in Mumbai when the city was rocked by a series of bombs on July 11, 2006. Over 200 people were killed and more than 700 were injured in the coordinated terror attacks on suburban trains. The attacks were masterminded by the Pakistan-based terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).
For years, India had been fighting a war against terrorism emanating from Pakistan. The Mumbai attacks were a turning point in India's fight against terrorism. The government realized that it needed to take a more aggressive stance against Pakistan and its state-sponsored terrorism.
In a recent speech, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar highlighted the significant achievements of the Modi government over the past nine years in delegitimising Pakistan's terror activities. Here are some of the key insights from his speech:
For decades, Pakistan has been using terrorism as a state policy to bleed India with a thousand cuts. Starting from the early 1980s, Pakistan started providing support to various terrorist groups in India, including the Kashmiri separatists.
These groups operated with impunity from the Pakistani soil, and the Pakistani establishment provided them with safe havens, training, and financial support. Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) played a key role in orchestrating these terror attacks.

"2023-06-12 04:20 AM;","Traveling sustainably has become a top priority in recent years, with more and more people looking for ways to reduce their carbon footprint. Airlines are also taking note and seeking ways to reduce their emissions. One CEO who believes he has found the answer is JÃ³zsef VÃ¡radi, the CEO of Wizz Air Abu Dhabi. In this article, we will explore why he believes hydrogen is the future of sustainable travel.
Imagine a world where airplanes run on hydrogen instead of fossil fuels. A world where flying is not only faster but also cleaner and more sustainable. This may seem like a futuristic scenario, but it's actually closer than you think. Hydrogen has the potential to revolutionize the aviation industry and provide a more sustainable alternative to traditional fuels.
Several airlines have already started experimenting with hydrogen-powered planes. For example, Airbus has developed three different concepts for hydrogen-powered planes that could be in service by 2035. ZeroAvia, a UK-based startup, has also developed a hydrogen-electric plane that completed a test flight in September 2020. The plane flew for 20 minutes and reached an altitude of 1,000 feet.
But it's not just planes that can benefit from hydrogen technology. The Japanese car manufacturer Toyota has already released a hydrogen fuel cell car, the Mirai, which produces zero emissions. The car can also travel up to 312 miles on a single tank of hydrogen.
One major advantage of hydrogen is that it can be produced using renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar power. This means that hydrogen-powered transportation could eventually become completely emissions-free. It would also help to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and decrease greenhouse gas emissions.

"2023-06-12 04:30 AM;","On Friday, the Pakistan government unveiled a Rs 14.4 trillion budget for 2023-24 to combat a looming default due to shrinking foreign reserves. However, Imran Khan's political party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), has criticized the budget, calling it ""artificial"" and ""non-realistic.""
In 2018, Imran Khan's PTI came to power, promising to turn the country's struggling economy around. However, nearly three years later, Pakistan's economic situation remains dire, with high inflation, a growing debt burden, and unemployment on the rise.
Amid this backdrop, the government presented its budget for the next fiscal year, hoping to address these issues. However, the PTI has called the budget unrealistic, arguing that it relies too heavily on revenue targets that are unlikely to be met.
The PTI's criticism of the budget is not unfounded. In recent years, Pakistan has struggled to meet revenue targets, despite implementing various tax reforms and crackdowns on corruption.
According to a report by The Express Tribune, Pakistan's Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) missed its tax collection target in 2020-21, falling short by nearly Rs 600 billion. This shortfall has put further pressure on the government's finances, which are already stretched thin.

"2023-06-12 04:50 AM;","Once upon a time, China was the go-to destination for global manufacturing. But in recent years, geopolitical tensions and rising labour costs have pushed companies to look for alternatives. One country that has been gaining attention is India.
With a population of more than 1.3 billion, India boasts a large talent base and a thriving tech industry. It also has the potential to become a leading manufacturing hub outside of China, according to Karl Mehta, chairman of the Quad Investment Network.
The Quad Investment Network is a group of investors and executives from the Quad countries (Australia, India, Japan, and the US) who are working together to identify opportunities for collaboration and investment. The network has identified nine technological areas that are crucial for supply chains:
India has the potential to play a crucial role in developing many of these areas, thanks to its large talent pool and a growing tech industry. Let's take a closer look at some examples of how India is already making strides in these critical technologies:
India has been at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19, with several companies developing vaccines against the virus. India's Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine manufacturer by volume, has partnered with British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to manufacture the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Another Indian company, Bharat Biotech, has developed its own vaccine, called Covaxin, which has been approved for emergency use in India.

"2023-06-12 05:10 AM;","It was a bright and sunny day in the Galwan Valley when the unexpected happened. Both Indian and Chinese forces faced off each other just a few feet away from each other. What started off as a minor disagreement turned into a violent skirmish leaving several soldiers from both sides dead.
As the world looked on, tensions between India and China have only heightened since the Galwan Valley clash in June 2020. In the months that followed, both sides continued to trade barbs and accusations, with China claiming that India has illegally occupied its territory along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).
India has always denied these claims and has put forth evidence to back up its stance. Recently, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar gave a speech refuting China's land grab allegations and putting forth India's side of the story. Let's take a closer look at what he said and understand the ongoing standoff along the LAC.
One of the main issues that have exacerbated tensions between India and China is the deployment of troops along the LAC. India has accused China of deploying large numbers of soldiers close to the border, which it claims is a violation of bilateral agreements. China, on the other hand, has claimed that it has a right to deploy its troops wherever it wants within its own territory.
This issue of forward deployment has led to multiple face-offs between the two sides in the past, with soldiers engaging in physical altercations in some instances. In his speech, Jaishankar highlighted this issue and stated that India has always maintained that the ""deployment of large amounts of troops by China close to our border can cause friction and has the potential of escalating into a larger conflict."" He added that India has always advocated for ""respect of the Line of Actual Control and for clarity in the LAC so that both sides can exercise their respective rights and interests in the area.""

"2023-06-12 05:20 AM;","When it comes to defense, all countries around the world prioritize their safety and security. The development and deployment of advanced defense systems is a crucial aspect of any nation's strategy. India, being an active rival of China and a member of ASEAN, recently announced the series production of its indigenous BrahMos missiles, which can be used for both land and sea defense. BrahMos missiles are known for their high speed, precision, and effectiveness, and are considered a game-changer for defense strategies.
The BrahMos missile system has been specifically designed to meet the needs of India's armed forces in a range of combat scenarios. These missiles have been deployed to help the Indian Army, Navy, and Air Force protect the borders and ensure national security. The BrahMos missile system can be launched from multiple platforms, including land-based mobile launchers, submarines, and ships. The missile has a range of 290 km and can carry a warhead of up to 300 kg.
During the 2019 Balakot airstrike, BrahMos missiles were used to hit terrorist camps in Pakistan. This was a defining moment for the Indian defense forces, as the missiles displayed their capability to penetrate enemy territory and inflict severe damage. Furthermore, the BrahMos missile system has been tested and proven successful in multiple simulations and live-fire exercises, enabling India to efficiently defend its land borders and maintain superiority in the region.
The BrahMos missile system has also been designed to dominate the maritime domain. The missile can be launched from ships, submarines, and aircraft, making it a versatile defense asset. The missile is capable of hitting targets with high precision, even in adverse weather conditions, thanks to its advanced guidance system.
India, being strategically located in the Indian Ocean, is surrounded by a variety of security threats, such as piracy, arms smuggling, and terrorism. The BrahMos missile system enables the Indian Navy to protect its shores and maintain maritime dominance. The missile system has undergone successful tests from both surface ships and submerged submarines.

His speech was assertive, highlighting India's contribution to the world and calling out Pakistan for its support of terrorism. Modi's speech showcased India's new foreign policy, one that is muscular and confident on the global stage.
India's new foreign policy can be seen in its approach to its neighbors, particularly Pakistan and China. In 2019, India revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, a move that was celebrated by many Indians but criticized by Pakistan and China. India also conducted air strikes on a terrorist camp in Pakistan in response to a terrorist attack on Indian soldiers.
India's foreign policy has also been visible in its relationship with the United States. Modi has developed a strong personal relationship with President Donald Trump and has worked to strengthen India's ties with the US. India has also become more assertive in its relations with China, with both countries engaging in border standoffs in 2020.
India has also taken a more active role in international organizations and initiatives. In 2016, India launched the International Solar Alliance, a group of countries working to promote solar energy. India has also sought to play a larger role in the United Nations, with Modi calling for India to be given a permanent seat on the UN Security Council.

"2023-06-12 05:40 AM;","In 2014, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited India. The two countries signed several agreements, including a $20 billion deal for China to build two power plants in India. The visit was hailed as a breakthrough in Indo-China relations and was seen as a sign of growing economic and strategic ties between the two countries.
However, just a few months later, in 2015, tensions between the two countries escalated when China blocked India's membership bid to the Nuclear Suppliers Group. This was seen as a betrayal by India, which had expected China to support its bid.
Since then, India has adopted a more nuanced approach towards China under the leadership of S. Jaishankar. While Jaishankar was initially optimistic about the potential for cooperation between the two countries, he soon realized that China's actions were driven more by strategic interests than by any desire to build a genuine partnership with India.
One example of this was India's decision to boycott China's Belt and Road Initiative, which it saw as a strategic move by China to gain influence in the region. India also stepped up its military presence in the Himalayan region, where it shares a border with China, in response to Chinese incursions.
Another example was India's decision to ban several Chinese apps, including TikTok, citing national security concerns. This move was seen as a response to China's growing influence in India's tech sector.

"2023-06-12 05:50 AM;","In the year 2027, India is expected to surpass China in terms of population, becoming the most populous country in the world.
For decades, China has held the title of the most populous country in the world, with a population of over 1.4 billion people. However, a recent report by the United Nations Population Division suggests that India's population has now surged ahead, with an estimated population of 1.37 billion people.
This development has significant implications for both India and China, as well as for the global economy and geopolitical landscape. Let's take a closer look at what it means.
India has experienced rapid population growth over the past few decades, thanks in part to improved healthcare and sanitation, as well as a decline in fertility rates in other parts of the world. While this growth has brought challenges such as overcrowding and strain on resources, it has also presented opportunities for economic growth.
With a young and growing workforce, India has the potential to become a major player in the global economy. However, this will require investment in education and infrastructure, as well as policies that promote innovation and entrepreneurship.

It was a nail-biting showdown at the Ageas Bowl in Southampton, where India and New Zealand fought tooth and nail for the title of champions of the inaugural World Test Championship (WTC). However, in the end, it was the Kiwis who emerged victorious.
The loss left Indian fans and cricket pundits scratching their heads, trying to figure out what went wrong. Some pointed fingers at the team's poor performance, while others blamed it on the conditions. But one person, in particular, had some scathing remarks to make about Team India's head coach, Rahul Dravid.
The former Pakistan cricketer, Tanvir Ahmed, who is now a coach himself, took a dig at Dravid, referring to him as ""absolutely zero"". In an interview with a Pakistani news channel, he suggested that Dravid was unable to comprehend India's strategy and that his poor tactics during the WTC final cost India the game.

"2023-06-12 06:10 AM;","The tension between India and Pakistan never ceases to exist, be it politics, economy, or sports. The recent India-Pakistan match witnessed a heated argument between Basit Ali, a former Pakistani cricketer, and Rahul Dravid, the head coach of Team India. Basit Ali, in an interview with a Pakistani news channel, ripped apart Dravid's coaching skills, calling him 'absolutely zero'. However, with India's strong performance in the last few years, is he really justified in making such a statement? Let's dive deeper into this controversy.
Basit Ali's statement was made after India lost the toss and decided to field first in the recent India-Pakistan match. Basit Ali believed that the Indian team's lack of faith in their batting skills cost them the match. However, Dravid has always been known for his coaching skills and has done an impeccable job as India's coach.
While Basit Ali's statement gained a lot of criticism, it raises some questions about the role of a coach in a cricket match. Does a coach's input solely decide the outcome of a match? Or does it also depend on the team's performance on the day of the match? Let's take a look at some examples and case studies to get a better understanding.
Case Study 1: Greg Chappell's ill-fated coaching stint with Team India
Greg Chappell's coaching stint with Team India was short-lived and infamous. He was appointed as the coach of the Indian cricket team in 2005 and was expected to take India to new heights. However, his coaching methods and team selection policies did not go well with the Indian team players and he resigned in 2007.

"2023-06-12 06:20 AM;","The South China Sea has been a point of contention for various countries across the globe. China's claims over the region and its actions to assert its dominance have been met with resistance from several countries, including ASEAN member states. In recent news, Indonesia has announced that it will host ASEAN's first military drill in the South China Sea, which has drawn mixed reactions from the international community.
Various countries have overlapping claims over the South China Sea, including Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, and Taiwan. China, however, asserts that the entire region rightfully belongs to them and have been building artificial islands and militarizing them to assert their dominance. This has resulted in an ongoing conflict between China and other claimant states. This dispute has not only caused tensions but has also led to instances of violence and territorial disputes for which India and Japan condemned China's expansionist stance.
Indonesia announced that it will host a joint military drill among ASEAN member states in the South China Sea. This drill aims to improve the security of the region and increase the cooperation among ASEAN member states. This will be the first military exercise of its kind to take place in the South China Sea. The drill will take place in the Natuna Islands, which is a part of Indonesia's sovereign territory but has also been claimed by China. This move has been seen as Indonesia's way of asserting its sovereignty over the region and sending a strong message to China.
The announcement of the military drill has drawn mixed reactions from the international community. Some countries have applauded Indonesia for taking a firm stance against China's assertiveness in the region. However, China has expressed its disapproval of the move, stating that the drill will not promote regional peace and stability.
Several countries have experienced conflicts over territorial disputes in the South China Sea. In 2012, Philippines and China had a standoff over Scarborough Shoal, which is located in the South China Sea. China claimed the area as part of its territory, while Philippines claimed it as within its exclusive economic zone. The standoff lasted for several months before a resolution was reached. In another instance, in 2014, China installed an oil rig in Vietnam's exclusive economic zone, which led to anti-Chinese protests in Vietnam and a territorial dispute that lasted for months. Japan and Indonesia are also claiming some parts of this Sea as their territory. Russian fleets have been going to South China seas too as they want to expand their power and influence in East Asia.

"2023-06-12 06:30 AM;","The oceans have always been a vital source of resources and transportation, and therefore, they have been governed by international laws and regulations. However, some countries have been accused of flouting these laws, particularly China. China's increasing presence and activities in the maritime domain have raised questions about whether it is reshaping the global oceans regime.
China has always had a long coastline, but it is not until recently that it has taken a more assertive stance in the maritime domain. China's maritime ambitions can be traced back to the early 1990s when it started building up its navy and investing in maritime capabilities. In recent years, China has been involved in various maritime disputes in the South China Sea and the East China Sea, where it has claimed sovereignty over vast areas of waters, including islands and reefs that are also claimed by other countries.
China has also been accused of engaging in various illegal activities, such as illegal fishing, piracy, and smuggling, which have threatened the security and stability of the oceans. China's activities in the maritime domain have not gone unnoticed and have sparked concern among other countries, particularly those that have a stake in the oceans.
China's assertiveness in the maritime domain can be seen through various case studies. One of the most notable is the South China Sea dispute, where China claims sovereignty over almost 90% of the sea, which is also claimed by other countries, such as the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Brunei. China has built artificial islands and military facilities on some of the disputed islands, which has raised tension and concerns among other countries.
The East China Sea dispute is another example of China's maritime assertiveness. China and Japan have been engaged in a territorial dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, which has escalated in recent years. China has been conducting military drills and sending coast guard vessels to patrol the waters around the islands, which has raised concerns about potential clashes with Japan.

"2023-06-12 06:40 AM;","Japan has a long and rich history of art that encompasses various forms such as painting, sculpture, calligraphy, and printmaking. One of the significant movements that emerged in the early 20th century was Sosaku Hanga or Creative Print. This art movement, which was led by artists like Takehisa Yumeji, Hiratsuka Un'ichi, and Onchi Koshiro, focused on the creative process of printmaking, emphasizing the individual artist's expression and originality rather than the collaborative approach of traditional printmaking. One of the leading figures of this movement was Koizumi Kishio, whose work exemplified the essence and philosophy of Sosaku Hanga.

Koizumi Kishio was born in Yokohama in 1893 and grew up in a family of artists. He studied Western-style painting in Tokyo and later went to France to study Impressionism. In 1922, he returned to Japan and joined the Sosaku Hanga movement, where he began experimenting with printmaking techniques using woodblock and metal plates. His prints were characterized by bold lines, simplified forms, and a strong sense of design. He also explored various themes and subjects, ranging from landscapes and nature to social issues and human emotions.

"2023-06-12 07:00 AM;","It was a busy day at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) in Nairobi, Kenya. As I walked by the cargo section, I couldn't help but notice a batch of goods being unloaded from a Saudi Arabian cargo plane. The crates were marked with the logos of well-known brands like Samsung and LG. This struck me as odd, considering that China and India have been the traditional powerhouses for imports into Kenya. What has changed?
According to data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), Saudi Arabia has surpassed China and India as Kenya's biggest source of imports. In the year ending December 2020, Kenya imported goods worth Ksh 127.8 billion (USD 1.2 billion) from Saudi Arabia, a 3.5% increase from the previous year. On the other hand, imports from China decreased by 18.5% to Ksh 121.9 billion (USD 1.1 billion) during the same period. India followed closely at Ksh 117.3 billion (USD 1.1 billion).
The electronics market in Kenya has been dominated by Chinese products for a long time. However, the tide seems to be turning with the entry of Saudi Arabian brands. Samsung, for instance, has been making significant inroads in the Kenyan market, with their phones and TVs gaining popularity due to their quality and affordability. LG is also making a comeback, with their home appliances like refrigerators and washing machines being sought after by Kenyan consumers.
Saudi Arabia is the world's largest exporter of oil, and it's not surprising that Kenya imports significant amounts of oil and gas products from the kingdom. In 2020, Kenya imported Ksh 64.2 billion (USD 586 million) worth of mineral fuels and oils from Saudi Arabia. These products are used to power industries like transport, manufacturing, and agriculture. With the recent discovery of oil deposits in Kenya's Turkana region, there could be potential opportunities for collaboration between the two countries in the oil sector.
Saudi Arabia has been importing a significant amount of food and agricultural products from Kenya, ranging from fruits and vegetables to tea and coffee. In 2020, Kenya exported Ksh 3.8 billion (USD 35 million) worth of tea to Saudi Arabia, making it one of the largest buyers of Kenyan tea in the Middle East. There is also potential for increased exports of fresh produce like avocados and mangoes to the Saudi Arabian market.

"2023-06-12 07:10 AM;","In recent years, tension has been prevailing between India and China along the northern borders. The Indian Navy has now carried out its first exercise with two new aircraft carriers â€“ INS Vikramaditya and INS Vikrant â€“ along with 35 aircraft and other warships to demonstrate its maritime muscles in the Indian Ocean region. This exercise showcases the power projection in the Arabian Sea with the help of MiG-29K fighter jets.
Over the years, the Indian Navy has shown exemplary strength and resilience in the Indian Ocean region. Some notable examples include:
One of the most significant events in the Indian Navy's history was during the 1971 Indo-Pakistan War. The Indian Navy played a pivotal role in thwarting Pakistan's attempt to attack India's western shores. The attack, codenamed 'Operation Trident,' involved the deployment of three missile boats â€“ INS Nipat, INS Nirghat and INS Veer.
Recently, the Indian Navy was involved in joint exercises with the US Navy in the Bay of Bengal. The exercise, called 'Malabar 2020,' aimed at enhancing interoperability between the two navies and included complex maritime movements and anti-submarine drills.
The Indian Navy's recent exercises with two new aircraft carriers demonstrate its commitment to maintaining security in the Indian Ocean region. The Navy has proved its strength and resilience over the years, and their involvement in joint exercises with other navies will only enhance their capabilities. As India's ambitions grow with regards to security in the region, the Indian Navy will continue to play a critical role.

Gone are the days of high inflation rates, revenue shortfalls, and balance of payment issues that have kept the nation on shaky grounds for years. The announcement came after a successful financial quarter where Pakistan managed to stabilize its economy and achieve satisfactory economic growth.

A few years back, the situation in Pakistan was significantly different. The country's inflation rate was skyrocketing, surpassing the 25% level in some sectors. Shortages of energy and inadequate infrastructure led to low confidence in the country's investment climate, precisely when the world was in a financial crisis. International investors were wary of the situation in Pakistan due to its political instability, energy crisis, security issues, and poor state of human development.

Recently, Iran proposed the formation of an Indian Ocean naval alliance to ensure collective maritime security, and Pakistan has said that it will examine this proposal.
But what exactly does this proposal entail, and why is it so important?
Maritime security is crucial for many reasons, such as:
The Indian Ocean is one of the busiest and most strategic waterways in the world, serving as a vital shipping lane for oil, natural gas, and other goods between Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. It is also home to numerous territorial disputes, political tensions, and security challenges, which threaten the stability and prosperity of the region.
Therefore, any initiative that seeks to enhance maritime security in the Indian Ocean deserves careful consideration and evaluation.

"2023-06-12 07:40 AM;","The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the global economy hard, and Pakistan is no exception. With businesses shutting down, unemployment rates rising, and the government struggling to control the spread of the virus, the country is facing one of its biggest crises in recent times. However, Pakistan's Finance Minister, Shaukat Tarin, remains optimistic. In a recent interview, he expressed his hopes for the country's future and outlined his plans to revive the economy.
One of Tarin's plans is to invest in the agriculture sector. Pakistan is an agricultural country, and almost 62% of the population is employed in this sector. However, it has been neglected for many years, leading to a decrease in productivity and yield. Tarin aims to increase the sector's productivity by modernizing it with new technology, improving irrigation systems, and providing better access to credit facilities for farmers. This initiative would not only create job opportunities but also increase the country's export earnings and reduce its reliance on imports.
Another area of focus for Tarin is to encourage small and medium enterprises (SMEs). These businesses are the backbone of any economy and generate employment opportunities. However, they need access to credit facilities, which have been a challenge in Pakistan. Tarin plans to make it easier for SMEs to access credit by simplifying the loan application process and reducing interest rates. Additionally, the government will provide technical and vocational training to help these businesses grow and compete in the global market.
Last but not least, Tarin aims to improve the energy sector, which has been a major source of concern for Pakistan. The country has been facing power shortages for many years, and it has been relying heavily on expensive imported fuel for electricity generation. Tarin plans to invest in renewable energy projects, such as hydropower and solar, to reduce Pakistan's reliance on imported fuel. This initiative would not only provide a sustainable and cheaper source of energy for the country but wouldalso reduce its carbon emissions, contributing to the global effort to combat climate change.
In conclusion, Pakistan's Finance Minister has outlined his plans to revive the economy amid the COVID-19 crisis. By investing in agriculture, encouraging SMEs, and improving the energy sector, Tarin aims to create job opportunities, increase the country's export earnings, and reduce its reliance on imports and expensive fuel. Though these plans seem promising, their execution would require the government's commitment and financial resources. If implemented correctly, these initiatives can help Pakistan overcome the current economic crisis and pave the way for a prosperous future.

"2023-06-12 07:50 AM;","In a world where security threats are rapidly evolving, it's no surprise that countries like Pakistan want to increase their military capabilities. However, as the recent budgetary allocation reveals, Pakistan is still prioritizing defence spending even amidst its economic challenges. This begs the question, what are the costs and benefits of such spending, and is it worth it in the long run?
The answer is not straightforward as it depends on various factors, such as the country's strategic objectives, security challenges, and fiscal constraints. However, we can still draw some insights by examining the experiences of other countries and evaluating Pakistan's track record in defence spending.
Let's start with a case study of the United States, which spends more on defence than the next ten countries combined. According to a report by the Cost of War Project at Brown University, the US has spent over $2.3 trillion on the War on Terror since 2001, including $822 billion on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. This expenditure has not only strained America's economy but also failed to achieve its intended goals of eradicating terrorism and stabilizing the Middle East region.
On the other hand, let's look at a case study of China, which has been rapidly increasing its defence spending in recent years, surpassing even the US in some areas. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), China's military expenditure rose by 1.9% in 2020, reaching $252 billion, equivalent to 13% of global military spending. While China claims that its military buildup is defensive and peaceful, it has also been accused of destabilizing the Asia-Pacific region and challenging the US hegemony.
Now, let's come back to Pakistan and analyze its defence spending. As mentioned earlier, Pakistan has allocated over Rs 1.8 trillion for defence in its recent budget, a 15.5% increase from the previous year, despite facing severe economic challenges, such as high inflation, debt, and unemployment. While the government claims that the increase is necessary for national security and regional stability, some experts have criticized it for being unsustainable and unproductive.

"2023-06-12 08:00 AM;","Pakistan's economic situation has been in turmoil for a long time. The destabilization of economic growth has made it challenging for the country to meet its basic necessities. Pakistan is actively seeking additional bailout funds from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to alleviate the growing economic strain.
Pakistan has been struggling with its economy for an extended period, with growing concerns of a sharp economic downturn amid a rise in inflation and joblessness across the nation. Pakistan's economy has been declining as the current-account deficit and the budget deficit remain high, and foreign exchange reserves continue to deplete. In 2019, Pakistan endured the highest inflation rate in decades, with prices of essential items such as food and oil surging.
The country's budget was released in June 2021, announcing a modest growth rate of 4.8% for the current fiscal year, which started in July 2021. However, there are still doubts about the implementation of this growth rate, considering the high inflation rate and declining foreign reserves. The government is seeking a bailout from the IMF to overcome these challenges.
IMF's loan is vital for Pakistan to overcome its current economic crisis and regain stability. A bailout from the IMF could provide Pakistan with much-needed financial resources, such as foreign exchange reserves, to mitigate the country's severe economic crisis. Additionally, the IMF loan can assist in implementing economic reforms, which can help Pakistan's economy to improve in the long-term. The country is expected to receive a bailout of up to $6 billion from the IMF.
Pakistan has a long history of collaborating with the IMF to overcome economic challenges. The IMF loaned Pakistan $6.7 billion in 2013, under the Extended Fund Facility Program, which helped in stabilizing the country's economy. Following the implementation of various economic policies and reforms, Pakistan's economy began to improve, showing a growth rate of 5.28% by 2018.

"2023-06-12 08:10 AM;","Pakistan's finance minister Ishaq Dar has recently expressed his disappointment over the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) treatment of the country, describing it as ""totally unfair."" According to Dar, the global lender's decision to delay the bailout program for Pakistan has contributed to the economic turmoil in the country.
But what exactly is the root cause of this economic turmoil? One possible explanation is the IMF's stringent conditions for providing financial assistance to Pakistan. The country has received a total of 12 IMF bailouts over the years, and all of them came with the same set of conditions: austerity measures, privatization of state-owned enterprises, and structural reforms. Critics argue that these measures have only worsened the country's economic problems, and have failed to deliver the desired results.
Let's take a look at some case studies that illustrate the negative impact of the IMF's conditions on Pakistan's economy:
In the late 1990s, the IMF forced Pakistan to privatize its state-owned utilities, including electricity, gas, and water. The plan was to improve the efficiency and productivity of these entities. However, since the privatization, the prices of these utilities have skyrocketed, making it harder for ordinary Pakistanis to afford them. Moreover, the new private entities have failed to deliver the promised improvements in service quality and reliability.
One of the most controversial conditions imposed by the IMF in its bailout programs is austerity measures. These measures involve cutting public spending, increasing taxes, and reducing subsidies. While these measures are supposed to reduce the budget deficit, they often end up hurting the most vulnerable segments of the population. In Pakistan, the IMF's austerity measures have led to cuts in health and education spending, negatively impacting the country's human development indicators.

The IMF delayed the bailout program for Pakistan, despite the country being in dire need of financial assistance. In recent times Pakistan has faced economic turmoil and Dar believes that the IMF has contributed to this.
A case in point is the highly controversial Zero Tolerance Policy that was implemented by the IMF in Pakistan in 2019. This policy effectively meant that all projects that were not included in the budget were to be shut down, causing a lot of economic damage in the country. Even though the Pakistani government made efforts to convince the IMF to modify this policy, it was unsuccessful.
Another example is the IMF's insistence on imposing austerity measures on Pakistan as part of a bailout package in 2018. Though it was intended to bring financial stability, this decision resulted in a significant increase in inflation, job losses, and the cost of living.
The IMF's actions have had a significant impact on the people of Pakistan. Due to the implementation of the austerity measures, education and healthcare have become inaccessible to many, and it has resulted in a rise in poverty. According to a report by the United Nations Development Programme, Pakistan has the highest multidimensional poverty rate in South Asia, with 39% of its population living in poverty.

"2023-06-12 08:30 AM;","The recent economic crisis in Pakistan has led to the government showing interest in joining the BRICS group. BRICS, an economic bloc that includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, was formed on June 16, 2009. South Africa was the only country to join the bloc after its formation in December 2010. The group represents about 42% of the world's population and has a combined GDP of around $16 trillion.
Once upon a time, there was a small business owner in Pakistan who was struggling to keep his business afloat. He had invested all his savings and taken out loans to fund his business, but due to the economic crisis, he was not making enough profits to pay off his debts. He began to look for a solution to his problem and stumbled upon the BRICS group.
After doing his research, he discovered that joining the BRICS group could benefit his business in many ways. The group had a large market with a growing middle class and a high demand for products and services. This was exactly the kind of market he needed to expand his business and increase his profits. He also found out that the BRICS group had a development bank that could provide loans at lower interest rates compared to the traditional banks in Pakistan.
The business owner decided to take a chance and applied to join the BRICS group. After a thorough evaluation process, his application was accepted, and he became a member of the group. He was now able to export his products to other BRICS countries, get loans from the development bank and access new markets. His business started to grow, and he was able to pay off his debts and even expand his business further.
When Brazil joined the BRICS group in 2009, its economy was struggling. The country was facing high inflation, low growth, and a weak currency. However, after joining the group, Brazil's economy started to recover. The country was able to export more to other BRICS countries and access new markets. The BRICS development bank also provided loans at lower interest rates, which helped the Brazilian government fund infrastructure projects and stimulate economic growth. Today, Brazil is one of the largest economies in the world and a key member of the BRICS group.

A country's budget deficit is the amount by which its expenses exceed its revenues. A high budget deficit can lead to inflation and a decrease in the value of the country's currency. In Pakistan, the government has set a target to reduce the budget deficit to 6.54% for the 2023-2024 fiscal year.
In this article, we will explore the reasons behind Pakistan's high budget deficit, what measures the government is taking to reduce it, and the impact it can have on the country's economy.
In the current fiscal year (2021-2022), Pakistan's budget deficit is expected to reach 7.1% of GDP, which is higher than the government's initial target of 6.3%. The COVID-19 pandemic and an increase in military spending are some of the key reasons behind this high deficit.
In order to reduce the budget deficit, the government is taking several measures. First, it plans to increase revenue by improving tax collection and broadening the tax base. Second, it plans to reduce spending on non-developmental expenses. Third, it plans to increase exports and attract foreign investment to boost the economy.

"2023-06-12 08:50 AM;","It is a well-known fact that drugs are a menace to society and the younger generation is more vulnerable to it. India has been facing a drug epidemic and one of its originating sources is from our neighboring country Pakistan. Punjab Governor Shriban Purohit has recently backed India's 'surgical strike' on Pakistan for pushing drugs into the country.
Pakistan has been using different ways such as via air, sea and land to smuggle drugs into India. They have been successful in doing this as the drug route from Pakistan to India is not only the cheapest but also the safest in the world. The drugs eventually reach the hands of youth and drugs such as 'chitta' (heroin laced with caffeine or other powders) and 'ice' (crystal meth) are leading to an exponential growth of addiction in Punjab.
A recent study by a Punjab University Professor has shown that over 60% of Punjab's youth is in the grip of drug addiction. The same study also revealed that heroin was the most favored drug among the youth, with synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) being the second and third most popular drug respectively.
Clinics such as the Guru Nanak Mission Hospital in Jalandhar and other de-addiction centers in Punjab have also seen a rise in patients. Out of all the patients admitted in these centers, a staggering 80% are between the ages of 15 and 35. These patients come from all strata of society, including middle-class and rich families.
The younger generation is the most affected by this drug influx from Pakistan. The situation is so bad that the students have started to attend classes under the influence of drugs. The increase in addiction among the students has led to a decrease in the average academic performance, and in some cases, the inability to attend classes altogether. The students who are addicted to drugs opt for dropout or face expulsion from the school.

Geopolitical forecasting is a tricky business, often characterized by uncertainty, ambiguity, and error. As someone who has spent years studying and practicing strategic foresight, I can attest to the challenges of trying to anticipate the future of world affairs. But I can also attest to the rewards of getting it right.
Two cases come to mind when I think about my successes and failures in predicting global events. The first is Egypt's 2011 revolution against former President Hosni Mubarak. In 2010, I had written a report arguing that Egypt was likely to experience a political crisis within the next decade, due to a combination of economic stagnation, social unrest, and political repression. I had based my analysis on numerous indicators, including government corruption, youth unemployment, food inflation, and popular protests.
When the Arab Spring erupted in Tunisia at the end of 2010, I knew that Egypt was ripe for a similar uprising. I vividly remember watching the protests unfold in Cairo's Tahrir Square on live TV, feeling a mixture of excitement and anxiety. When Mubarak stepped down in February 2011, I felt vindicated in my prediction. I had correctly identified the underlying drivers of change in Egypt and the region and had anticipated the possibility of a regime change.
The second case is Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014. In 2012, I had written another report arguing that Russia was unlikely to take military action against Ukraine, despite Moscow's concerns about NATO expansion and Ukraine's pro-Western orientation. I had based my analysis on several factors, including Russia's economic constraints, Ukraine's strategic importance, and the potential diplomatic costs of a military intervention.

"2023-06-12 09:10 AM;","The world's geopolitical landscape has been constantly evolving, with new challenges emerging every day. In such a scenario, maintaining stability becomes crucial to ensure peace and prosperity. The military partnership between Russia and China has emerged as a significant force in ensuring global stability. Let's take a closer look at their partnership.
Valery Gerasimov, the chief of staff of Russian Armed Forces, stated that the cooperation between Russia and China had reached an unprecedented level and played a crucial role in ensuring global stability. The two nations engage in regular military exercises, share intelligence, and exchange advanced weapons and technology.
However, the partnership between Russia and China is not a new development. The two nations have a shared history and ideology that goes back to the Cold War era. During that time, both Russia and China were communist countries, and they supported each other in various ways. The partnership strengthened after the Soviet Union collapsed, and China emerged as a major player in the world stage.
Currently, Russia and China are facing significant challenges from the West, particularly from the United States. Both nations have faced economic sanctions and trade restrictions from the West, which has led them to rely on each other for support. Additionally, both countries share a vision of a multipolar world and oppose any attempts by the West to dominate international affairs.
In September 2018, Russia and China conducted the joint military exercise Vostok-2018, which involved 300,000 troops, 1,000 aircraft, and 36,000 tanks and other vehicles. The exercise was one of the largest military maneuvers in history and showcased the close ties between the two nations' armed forces.

"2023-06-12 09:20 AM;","It was an ordinary day in Riyadh, the capital city of Saudi Arabia, when the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived at the King Khalid International Airport. He was there to meet with Saudi officials and discuss a range of issues, including the ongoing war in Yemen, human rights concerns, and the recent tensions with Iran. However, there was one topic that overshadowed all others - the growing economic and strategic ties between Saudi Arabia and China.
The visit of Blinken to Saudi Arabia highlighted the importance of China as a key player in the Middle East. With $87.3 billion in bilateral trade and President Xi's warm reception, the relationship between Saudi Arabia and China has deepened. In this article, we will explore the reasons behind this growing partnership, and what it means for the global dynamics of geopolitics.
The world is changing, and so are the global dynamics of power. While the US has been the dominant player in the Middle East for decades, China has been making inroads in the region, particularly in terms of economic ties. As the US continues to face challenges in the region, such as the conflict in Yemen, and the tensions with Iran, Saudi Arabia has turned to China as a strategic partner.
One of the key drivers of this shift in global dynamics is the growing economic relationship between Saudi Arabia and China. In recent years, China has become Saudi Arabia's top trading partner, surpassing the US and the EU. This has been fueled by China's demand for oil, with Saudi Arabia being the world's largest oil exporter.
However, the relationship between Saudi Arabia and China is not just about oil. China is also investing heavily in infrastructure projects in the kingdom, such as the construction of new cities and high-speed railway networks. Additionally, the two countries have signed agreements on trade, investment, and cultural exchange, which have further strengthened their economic ties.

"2023-06-12 09:30 AM;","In a world where sporting events have been heavily influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, many cities have had to revamp their plans to host major global events. However, Hong Kong managed to secure a win in the midst of India's misfortune. The global sporting group IMG has confirmed that Hong Kong will host the ATP 250 event in January 2024, following the expiration of the five-year deal with Tata Open. The announcement has brought excitement, not just for tennis fans, but also for local businesses and the economy in general.
Hosting sporting events is often seen as a way to boost local economies, especially in the hospitality, retail, and tourism sectors. These events create jobs, generate revenue, and draw in large crowds of visitors. According to the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB), the average tennis fan spends around HKD 2,000 ($257) per day, which means hosting a tennis event such as ATP 250 could bring in millions of dollars to the city.
But it's not just about the money. Sporting events also provide an opportunity for brand promotion and image building. Hosting major international events showcases a city's infrastructure, facilities, and organizational ability. It provides a positive image to the rest of the world and can generate long-term benefits such as increased tourism and investment.
The announcement that Hong Kong will host the ATP 250 event has generated excitement among local businesses and tennis fans alike. It is expected to bring in thousands of visitors to the city, who will spend money on accommodation, dining, and shopping. The event will also create job opportunities for locals, ranging from security and hospitality staff to marketing and PR professionals.
But the benefits are not just economic. The fact that Hong Kong is hosting a major international event, while many other cities are struggling due to the pandemic, is a testament to the city's resilience and determination. It sends a positive message to the rest of the world that Hong Kong is open for business and ready to host major events.

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are some of the most powerful and mysterious events in the universe. They are intense flashes of gamma rays that last only a few seconds and are thought to be caused by the collapse of massive stars or the collision of neutron stars. GRBs can release as much energy in a few seconds as the sun does in billions of years.
On June 16, 2020, the China's Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) detected a GRB that was later identified as the brightest ever observed. The burst, named GRB 200415A, was located about 30 billion light years away from Earth and lasted for less than two seconds. Despite its short duration, the burst generated a huge amount of energy that was visible across a wide range of frequencies.
The LHAASO's detection of GRB 200415A is a major breakthrough in the study of these astronomical events. For the first time, scientists have been able to observe the afterglow of a GRB from multiple perspectives, thanks to the LHAASO's advanced instrumentation. The observatory is located at an altitude of 4,410 meters above sea level in the Daocheng County of Southwest China, which gives it a clear view of the sky and reduces interference from the Earth's atmosphere.
According to the LHAASO team, the GRB was detected by several of the observatory's detectors, including the Wide Field of View Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (WFM), the Water Cherenkov Detector Array (WCDA), and the Muon Detector Array (MD). Each of these detectors provided a unique perspective on the burst's afterglow, allowing scientists to study its properties in unprecedented detail.

"2023-06-12 09:50 AM;","As the world reels under the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Pakistan is also facing an economic crisis. In such a scenario, the Pakistan government's proposal to allocate Rs 1.8 trillion for defence in the 2023-24 budget has raised eyebrows and sparked debates.
Pakistan's defence budget has been on an upward trend for the past few years. The country is one of the biggest spenders on defence in South Asia. In the 2020-2021 budget, Pakistan's defence budget was Rs 1.289 trillion, which was around 11.2 percent of the total budget. The 2021-2022 budget saw a 4.1 percent increase in the defence allocation, bringing the total figure to Rs 1.37 trillion.
The proposed Rs 1.8 trillion allocation for defence in the 2023-24 budget is a 32 percent increase from the previous year's allocation. The proposed allocation is also higher than the combined budgets of Pakistan's education and health ministries.
Those in favour of the increased defence spending argue that Pakistan is a country facing multiple security challenges. Pakistan shares borders with India, Afghanistan, and Iran, all of which are politically unstable regions. Moreover, Pakistan is also struggling to handle the rising insurgency in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces.
The proponents of increased defence spending argue that Pakistan's defence forces require modernisation and up-gradation to combat these challenges. The need for better weapons, facilities, and training justifies the proposed hike.

They had come to promote their country as a promising destination for investment and cooperation, and to seek support for their efforts to modernize the Kazakh economy.
As they presented their plan, one of the officials mentioned China's Belt and Road Initiative, a massive infrastructure project that seeks to connect Asia, Europe, and Africa through a network of highways, railways, ports, and pipelines. The Kazakhs knew they were on the crossroads of this project, and that China was eager to invest in their country.
But they also knew that they needed others partners, particularly the EU, to balance China's growing influence and avoid being dominated by its powerful neighbor. They argued that Kazakhstan had a unique role to play in connecting the EU with Asia, and that the EU had a vested interest in helping Kazakhstan to succeed.
The EU officials listened attentively, but remained skeptical. They had heard similar pitches from other countries and knew that Kazakhstan faced many challenges, including corruption, authoritarianism, and an over-reliance on fossil fuels.
Despite these concerns, several former diplomats and experts believe that Kazakhstan is a strategic opportunity for the EU, and that the EU can offer valuable support and incentives to help Kazakhstan to become a more open, prosperous, and democratic country. They offer three reasons why:

"2023-06-12 10:20 AM;","In a global security environment that is more dynamic than ever, quantum technology will emerge as a major frontier in cybersecurity. Quantum computing offers exponential advances in computing speed, which means that it has the potential to break current encryption schemes that protect sensitive data. Countries worldwide, including India, recognize the significance of quantum computing and are investing heavily in developing quantum technology. In this article, we will explore the security implications of quantum computing and how India's National Quantum Mission plans to address them.
To understand the security implications of quantum computing, let us begin with a story about a bank that used financial cryptography to secure its data. The bank thought its data was safe behind a 128-bit key encryption scheme. However, it was shocked to find out that a quantum computer could decipher the encryption within seconds. The bank lost all of its customer's confidential data due to a lack of understanding of the potential danger of quantum computing.
This is not a hypothetical scenario. In 2019, IBM announced the development of a 53-qubit quantum computer, which could perform a calculation in seconds that would take a traditional computer years to complete. This computing power can be used to break the encryption used in security protocols such as HTTPS, which is used to protect sensitive data such as passwords and financial information.
Another case study is the 2018 data breach of Under Armour's fitness app, MyFitnessPal. The breach exposed 150 million user accounts containing sensitive data such as usernames, email addresses, and passwords. The company's encryption used to protect the data was 128-bit SHA-1, which is vulnerable to quantum computing attacks.
India recognizes the potential of quantum technology and launched its National Quantum Mission in 2020. The mission aims to develop quantum technology in areas such as cybersecurity, communication, and computing. It aims to create a workforce with the skills to work in quantum technology, develop quantum computing infrastructure, and encourage research in the field.

It has a thriving economy and ambitious projects aimed at enhancing its infrastructure and developing its tourism industry. Such a country exists, and it is Kazakhstan.
However, this former Soviet Republic has been relatively unknown to the West, and its geopolitical importance has often been overlooked. Nevertheless, recent developments have caught the attention of foreign diplomats, who have recognized the untapped potential that exists between Kazakhstan and the EU.
According to former diplomats, Kazakhstan is an essential partner for the EU. The country is located in a geopolitical hotspot that is often overlooked by Western countries, and its economy is growing rapidly. The EU has acknowledged the potential that exists between the two parties and has recently signed a new agreement that will strengthen their cooperation even further.
The agreement aims to enhance dialogue between the EU and Kazakhstan and improve cooperation in areas such as energy, trade, and environment. It also seeks to promote human rights, rule of law, and democratic principles. The EU recognizes the value of Kazakhstan's location and sees the country as a gateway to Central Asia.
Kazakhstan's diplomatic relations with the EU have been vital to its development and international standing. For example, the EU has provided training to Kazakh judges and has also helped the country to adopt European environmental standards.

"2023-06-12 10:50 AM;","Once upon a time, in a small village in Myanmar, there lived a group of Rohingya Muslims who were constantly persecuted by the Myanmar military. They were forced to flee their homes and take shelter in neighboring countries. There are countless stories like this in the current Rohingya crisis, where millions of people are living in refugee camps due to ethnic cleansing.
The international community has been trying to solve the crisis for years, but the rivalry between the U.S. and China has been hindering the efforts. Both countries have their own agenda, and they are using the Rohingya crisis as a pawn in their power struggle.
The United States has been actively involved in advocating for the rights of the Rohingya people. In 2017, when the crisis was at its peak, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Myanmar's military leaders and halted military aid. The U.S. has also been pushing for an international inquiry into the atrocities committed against the Rohingya people.
On the other hand, China has been supporting the Myanmar government and has opposed any intervention from the international community. China has invested heavily in Myanmar's infrastructure projects, and the Rohingya crisis is seen as a disturbance to their plans.
The Rohingya crisis is not just a humanitarian crisis, but it also has political and economic implications. The Rohingya people have been deprived of basic human rights, including citizenship and the right to education and healthcare. This has led to a loss of potential manpower and human capital for Myanmar and neighboring countries.

"2023-06-12 11:00 AM;","When the Chinese government started cracking down on video game companies in 2018, the stock prices of Tencent and NetEase dropped, sparking a significant investor frenzy. The reason was the government's new regulation that required every game to be approved by the State Administration of Press and Publications before it could be published, resulting in a halt of the approval process.
The United States and China's relationship has influenced investors several times in recent years, creating significant political risks that investors must be aware of. This article will examine how the two countries' relationship affects investors and point out the risks involved. Some case studies will also be discussed in addition to the three key conclusions drawn at the end of the article.
The relationship between the United States and China has been up and down for the past decade. China's rise to become one of America's biggest trade partners caused worries in the US, especially after the trade deficit that grew to $419 billion in 2018. The pandemic also intensified the worries that the US had regarding China, which led to the US-China trade war that lasted from 2018-2020. During this period, tariffs were imposed on each country's imports and exports to each other.
The tensions between the two countries didn't end with the trade war. There are also issues on human rights violations in China, like the Chinese government's treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, and Beijing's encroachment on Hong Kong's autonomy. These human rights concerns have raised questions regarding US companies' use of Chinese factories and businesses.
The US-China relationship is a crucial consideration for investors because it affects the profits and value of companies that operate globally. The political risks that emerge from the US-China relationship imply the possibility of losing profits if a company loses access to a major market like China.

"2023-06-12 11:10 AM;","It was a cool evening in a small village of Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. Akbar, a Rohingya refugee, was sitting with his family outside his makeshift tent. Suddenly, he heard a loud noise from afar. As he looked towards the source of the sound, he saw two fighter jets of the US and China engaging in a dogfight. The moment was terrifying for Akbar as he knew that the political tensions between the two countries could impact his hope of returning to his homeland in Myanmar.
The ongoing rivalry between the US and China has been impacting global politics and economics. However, it should not hamper the efforts to find a sustainable solution to the Rohingya crisis. The crisis started when the Myanmar military launched a brutal crackdown on the Rohingya community, driving over 700,000 people to seek refuge in neighboring Bangladesh. Since then, several international efforts have been made to repatriate the refugees to their homeland, but none of them have been successful so far.
In recent times, the US-China rivalry has intensified, and both countries are actively involved in the global politics of the Asian continent. Myanmar, being a neighbor to both countries, is a crucial geostrategic location for them. China has been investing heavily in Myanmar's infrastructure, while the US is trying to counter China's influence by promoting human rights and democracy in the country. This has put the Rohingya crisis on the backburner for both countries, hindering the progress of any meaningful solution.
Another example of the impact of geopolitical tensions on the Rohingya crisis is the role of the United Nations. The UN has been working tirelessly to ensure a safe and dignified repatriation process for the refugees. However, the recent tussle between the US and China over the UN's budget allocation has made it difficult for the organization to work effectively. China has accused the US of using the UN for its political ambitions, while the US has criticized China for not contributing enough to the organization's budget. This has put a strain on the UN's capacity to deal with the Rohingya crisis effectively.
Despite the geopolitical tensions, there have been some positive developments in recent times. China has started showing interest in finding a solution to the Rohingya crisis, and the US has been pushing for a democratic transition in Myanmar. However, these efforts need to be intensified, and both countries should work together towards a common goal of finding a sustainable solution to the crisis. The Rohingya community has already suffered enough and deserves a chance to return to their homeland with dignity and safety.

"2023-06-12 11:20 AM;","It's day 3 of the World Test Championship (WTC) Final and Australia are already in a commanding position. After winning the toss on day 1, Indian skipper Rohit Sharma chose to bowl but his decision didn't pay off as Australia scored 332 runs in the first innings. India could only manage 217 runs in response. And now, in the second innings, Australia have a lead of 296 runs with 6 wickets in hand.
This is not the first time that India has struggled in Test cricket. In fact, India's away record in Test cricket has never been impressive. They have lost more Test series than they have won outside of Asia. The reasons for this are many, including the lack of quality pacers, inability to adapt to overseas conditions and a lack of preparation.
One of the biggest issues that India faces in Test cricket is the lack of quality pacers. In the past, India relied heavily on their spinners to win matches at home, but the same strategy doesn't work overseas. India's pace attack has always been a concern, especially when playing in countries like Australia, South Africa and England where the pitches offer more bounce and swing. In contrast, Australia has always been known for their formidable pace attack, which makes it difficult for the opposition batsmen to score runs.
For example, in the ongoing WTC Final, India's pace bowlers have struggled to make an impact. In the first innings, they managed to take only 3 wickets, whereas Australia's pacers picked up 9 wickets. This clearly shows the difference in the quality of the two teams' pace attacks.
Another issue that India faces in Test cricket is the inability to adapt to overseas conditions. In home conditions, India is a dominant force, but the same cannot be said about their performances overseas. Indian teams have always struggled to adapt to the conditions in countries like Australia, South Africa and England where the pitches offer more swing and bounce. The Indian batsmen have often been found wanting against good quality pace bowling on these pitches.
