  <h1>Strong Criticism From Shoaib Akhtar</h1></br> <img src="images/As-A-Coach-Rahul-Dravid-Is-Zero-Ex-Pakistan-Star-s-Strong-Take-On-India-Great.jpeg" alt="+As-A-Coach-Rahul-Dravid-Is-Zero-Ex-Pakistan-Star-s-Strong-Take-On-India-Great+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/as-a-coach-rahul-dravid-is-zero-ex-pakistan-stars-strong-take-on-ex-india-captain-4110315" target="_blank" href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/as-a-coach-rahul-dravid-is-zero-ex-pakistan-stars-strong-take-on-ex-india-captain-4110315" rel="noopener">https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/as-a-coach-rahul-dravid-is-zero-ex-pakistan-stars-strong-take-on-ex-india-captain-4110315</a></span></h5>
  <p>Former Pakistan cricketer Shoaib Akhtar has come out with a scathing attack on Rahul Dravid, who is currently the head coach of the Indian team. Speaking to a news channel, Akhtar said, "As a coach, Rahul Dravid is zero. He has been a great cricketer but coaching is a different ball game."</p>
  <h1>Decision Making in the WTC Final</h1></br> <img src="images/As-A-Coach-Rahul-Dravid-Is-Zero-Ex-Pakistan-Star-s-Strong-Take-On-India-Great.jpeg" alt="+As-A-Coach-Rahul-Dravid-Is-Zero-Ex-Pakistan-Star-s-Strong-Take-On-India-Great+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/as-a-coach-rahul-dravid-is-zero-ex-pakistan-stars-strong-take-on-ex-india-captain-4110315" target="_blank" href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/as-a-coach-rahul-dravid-is-zero-ex-pakistan-stars-strong-take-on-ex-india-captain-4110315" rel="noopener">https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/as-a-coach-rahul-dravid-is-zero-ex-pakistan-stars-strong-take-on-ex-india-captain-4110315</a></span></h5>
  <p>Akhtar's comments come in the wake of India's poor showing in the ongoing World Test Championship Final against New Zealand. He criticized the Indian team management for their decision making and said that Dravid had failed as a coach to prepare the team for such an important match.</p>
  <h2>Case Study - India's Batting Collapse</h2>
  <p>India won the toss and elected to bat first in the WTC Final, but their decision backfired as the team was bowled out for just 217 runs. The top order batsmen failed to apply themselves and were dismissed cheaply, putting immense pressure on the middle order. The team was eventually bowled out in just 92.1 overs.</p>
  <p>Akhtar pointed out that Dravid should have prepared his batsmen better for the conditions in England and said that the team management had made the wrong decision to bat first on a pitch that was showing signs of movement. He also criticized India's middle order for failing to read the conditions and adjust their game accordingly.</p>
  <h2>Case Study - Team Selection</h2>
  <p>Akhtar also criticized the Indian team management for their selection decisions. He questioned the decision to play both Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin in the playing XI, saying that it was a wrong move to play two spinners in English conditions. He also said that picking Ishant Sharma ahead of Mohammed Siraj was a mistake and that the team lacked the firepower to take wickets consistently.</p>
  <h2>Case Study - Over-Reliance on Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara</h2>
  <p>Akhtar pointed out that India's over-reliance on Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara had been exposed in the WTC Final. He said that the team lacked depth in their batting lineup and that the other batsmen had failed to perform when it mattered the most. He also criticized the Indian bowlers for their lackluster performance in the match.</p>
  <h1>Conclusion</h1></br> <img src="images/As-A-Coach-Rahul-Dravid-Is-Zero-Ex-Pakistan-Star-s-Strong-Take-On-India-Great.jpeg" alt="+As-A-Coach-Rahul-Dravid-Is-Zero-Ex-Pakistan-Star-s-Strong-Take-On-India-Great+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/as-a-coach-rahul-dravid-is-zero-ex-pakistan-stars-strong-take-on-ex-india-captain-4110315" target="_blank" href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/as-a-coach-rahul-dravid-is-zero-ex-pakistan-stars-strong-take-on-ex-india-captain-4110315" rel="noopener">https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/as-a-coach-rahul-dravid-is-zero-ex-pakistan-stars-strong-take-on-ex-india-captain-4110315</a></span></h5>
  <p>Shoaib Akhtar's criticism of Rahul Dravid and the Indian team management has sparked a debate in the cricketing world. While some have criticized Akhtar for his harsh words, others have praised him for speaking his mind. It remains to be seen how the Indian team responds to this criticism and whether they can improve their performance in the remaining days of the match.</p>
