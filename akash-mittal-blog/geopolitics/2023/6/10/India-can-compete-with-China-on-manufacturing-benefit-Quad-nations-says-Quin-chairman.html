  <p>Once upon a time, China was the go-to destination for global manufacturing. But in recent years, geopolitical tensions and rising labour costs have pushed companies to look for alternatives. One country that has been gaining attention is India.</p>
  <p>With a population of more than 1.3 billion, India boasts a large talent base and a thriving tech industry. It also has the potential to become a leading manufacturing hub outside of China, according to Karl Mehta, chairman of the Quad Investment Network.</p>
  <h2>Critical Technologies Identified by Quad Nations</h2>
  <p>The Quad Investment Network is a group of investors and executives from the Quad countries (Australia, India, Japan, and the US) who are working together to identify opportunities for collaboration and investment. The network has identified nine technological areas that are crucial for supply chains:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Clean energy</li>
   <li>Biotechnology</li>
   <li>Cybersecurity</li>
   <li>Defence tech</li>
   <li>Health tech</li>
   <li>Mobility</li>
   <li>Semiconductors</li>
   <li>Quantum technologies</li>
   <li>Space tech</li>
  </ul>
  <p>India has the potential to play a crucial role in developing many of these areas, thanks to its large talent pool and a growing tech industry. Let's take a closer look at some examples of how India is already making strides in these critical technologies:</p>
  <h3>Biotechnology: COVID-19 Vaccines</h3>
  <p>India has been at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19, with several companies developing vaccines against the virus. India's Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine manufacturer by volume, has partnered with British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to manufacture the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Another Indian company, Bharat Biotech, has developed its own vaccine, called Covaxin, which has been approved for emergency use in India.</p>
  <h3>Space Tech: ISRO's Missions</h3>
  <p>India's space agency, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), has been making impressive strides in space technology in recent years. In 2019, ISRO successfully launched its second lunar mission, Chandrayaan-2, which aimed to land a rover on the moon's south pole. Although the lander crashed, the mission was a significant achievement for India's space program. ISRO has also launched several successful missions to put satellites into orbit and develop its own navigational system, called NavIC.</p>
  <h3>Semiconductors: Make in India Initiative</h3>
  <p>The Indian government has been pushing for more local manufacturing of electronics, including semiconductors, through its Make in India initiative. In 2020, Korean electronics giant Samsung announced that it would invest $500 million to set up a smartphone display manufacturing plant in India. Other companies like Foxconn and Wistron have also announced plans to expand their manufacturing operations in India.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>India has the potential to become a global manufacturing giant and a key player in critical technologies valued by the Quad nations. Its large talent pool, growing tech industry, and government initiatives like Make in India make it an attractive destination for foreign investment. By collaborating with other Quad countries and investing in these key areas, India can play a crucial role in shaping the future of global supply chains.</p>
