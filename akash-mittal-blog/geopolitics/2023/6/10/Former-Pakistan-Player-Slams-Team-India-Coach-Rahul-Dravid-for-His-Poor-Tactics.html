    <h2>What Happened?</h2>
    <p>During the recent World Test Championship (WTC) final between India and New Zealand, former Pakistan batter Basit Ali criticized Team India coach Rahul Dravid for his poor tactics. Ali was particularly unhappy with Dravid's decision to play two spinners in overcast and seam-friendly conditions at the Ageas Bowl in Southampton, England.</p>
    <p>According to Ali, India did not have the right balance in their side and should have gone with an extra pacer instead of Ravindra Jadeja, who only managed to take one wicket in the match. Ali also questioned Dravid's strategy of promoting Jadeja up the order in India's second innings, which did not pay off as Jadeja was dismissed cheaply.</p>
    <p>This is not the first time that Ali has criticized the Indian team. In the past, he has accused them of being too defensive in their approach and lacking the killer instinct needed to win big matches.</p>

    <h2>Implications for Team India</h2>
    <p>Ali's comments have sparked a debate among cricket enthusiasts, with some supporting his viewpoint and others disagreeing with it. However, there is no denying that Dravid's tactics in the WTC final have come under scrutiny after India's disappointing performance, which ended in a defeat by eight wickets.</p>
    <p>While it is easy to criticize after the fact, it is important to understand the thought process behind Dravid's decisions. The conditions on the first day of the match were not as hostile as they were on the second and third days, when the ball started to move around more. The presence of two spinners allowed India to keep the run rate under control and build pressure on New Zealand's batsmen. However, the plan did not work as well as expected, as New Zealand's lower order managed to score crucial runs in both innings.</p>
    <p>The decision to promote Jadeja up the order was also a calculated risk, as he is a reliable batsman who has played crucial innings for India in the past. However, it did not pay off on this occasion, and India lost momentum in their second innings as a result. In hindsight, Dravid might have made different decisions, but it is important to remember that cricket is an unpredictable game and anything can happen on the day.</p>
    <h2>Lessons for Future Matches</h2>
    <p>The WTC final has highlighted some areas of improvement for India as they look ahead to future series. One of these is the need to have a better balance in their team, especially in seamer-friendly conditions. India's pace attack is one of the best in the world, and they should have backed themselves to take wickets with four front-line pacers instead of relying on spinners to do the job.</p>
    <p>Another lesson is the importance of adapting to changing circumstances in a match. India started the WTC final well, but lost momentum as the game progressed. They were unable to stem the flow of runs in the latter stages of both innings, which cost them the match in the end.</p>
    <p>Finally, India needs to continue to back its young players and give them more opportunities to prove themselves at the highest level. The likes of Shubman Gill, Rishabh Pant, and Mohammed Siraj have shown glimpses of their potential, and they should be given more chances to develop their skills and gain confidence on the international stage.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Basit Ali's criticism of Rahul Dravid's tactics in the WTC final has sparked a lively debate among cricket enthusiasts. While it is important to analyze what went wrong for India in the match, it is also important to remember that cricket is an unpredictable game and hindsight is always 20/20. Dravid's decisions were not entirely without merit, and India should learn from the experience and look to improve in the areas identified.</p>
