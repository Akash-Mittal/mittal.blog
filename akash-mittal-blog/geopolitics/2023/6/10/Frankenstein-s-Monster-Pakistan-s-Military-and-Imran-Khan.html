    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Politics in Pakistan has always been marred by the military's interference and control. In the recent years, however, a new player has come to the scene – Imran Khan. A former cricketer turned politician, Imran Khan has been the darling of Pakistan's military establishment for some time now. However, as the saying goes, "power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely". In the case of Imran Khan and the Pakistani military, it was a failed experiment resulting in a Frankenstein's monster that they couldn't control anymore.</p>

    <h2>History of Military's Involvement in Pakistani Politics</h2>
    <p>Pakistan's military has a long history of involvement in the country's politics. Since its inception in 1947, Pakistan has had several military coups and periods of military rule. The military's interference in politics is not limited to coups and martial law alone. It has also been involved in the selection of political leaders, formation of governments and policy-making. This interference has resulted in weakening Pakistan's democratic institutions and governance.</p>
    <p>The military's justification for its involvement is often that it is the only institution capable of ensuring the country's stability and national security. However, this argument has been undermined by the military's own actions, which have often resulted in further instability and insecurity.</p>

    <h2>Imran Khan's Political Career</h2>
    <p>Imran Khan entered politics in the late 1990s with the establishment of his political party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (Pakistan Movement for Justice or PTI). His initial foray into politics was met with little success, and he remained on the fringes of Pakistani politics for most of the next two decades. However, his fortunes changed in the run-up to the 2013 elections, where his anti-corruption rhetoric and promise of a "Naya Pakistan" (New Pakistan) resonated with a younger generation of Pakistani voters.</p>
    <p>Although PTI emerged as the second largest party in the 2013 elections, it failed to form a government. However, Imran Khan's popularity continued to grow, and he was seen as a viable alternative to the traditional political parties such as the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan People's Party (PPP).</p>

    <h2>Military's Support to Imran Khan</h2>
    <p>The military's support to Imran Khan can be traced back to the PTI's early days. Imran Khan's anti-corruption and anti-establishment rhetoric appealed to the military's desire to bring about a change in Pakistan's political landscape. The military saw an opportunity in Imran Khan to weaken the influence of the traditional political parties, such as the PML-N and the PPP, on Pakistan's politics.</p>
    <p>The military's support was instrumental in Imran Khan's rise to power. The military allegedly rigged the 2018 general elections in favor of the PTI, which resulted in Imran Khan becoming the Prime Minister of Pakistan. Imran Khan's government has been accused of being a 'selected' rather than 'elected' government, owing its allegiance to the military establishment rather than the people of Pakistan.</p>

    <h2>The Failed Experiment</h2>
    <p>The military's support for Imran Khan has proved to be a failed experiment. Imran Khan's government has been marked by failures on several fronts. The economy is in shambles, with inflation at an all-time high and the Pakistani rupee hitting historic lows. The country is facing a severe power crisis, with power outages lasting for up to 20 hours a day in some areas. The government has also been accused of curtailing press freedom, human rights abuses and authoritarianism.</p>
    <p>Moreover, Imran Khan's government has failed to deliver on its promise of a "Naya Pakistan". Instead, it has followed the same old policies that it had once criticized. For instance, its foreign policy has been pro-military, with Imran Khan echoing the military's views on India, Afghanistan and the United States.</p>
    <p>The military, on the other hand, has failed to control Imran Khan's government. The military's interference in politics has resulted in the weakening of Pakistan's democratic institutions and governance. The military's support for Imran Khan has also undermined Pakistan's electoral process, as evidenced by the allegations of rigging in the 2018 elections.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The relationship between Pakistan's military and Imran Khan can be likened to a Frankenstein's monster – a creation that they couldn't control anymore. The military's support for Imran Khan has resulted in the undermining of Pakistan's democratic institutions and governance. Imran Khan's government, on the other hand, has been marked by economic failures, authoritarianism and a failure to bring about the promised change. The military and Imran Khan's relationship has proven to be a failed experiment, with serious implications for the future of Pakistan's politics.</p>
