  <p>As the world reels under the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Pakistan is also facing an economic crisis. In such a scenario, the Pakistan government's proposal to allocate Rs 1.8 trillion for defence in the 2023-24 budget has raised eyebrows and sparked debates.</p>
  <h2>Overview of the Pakistan Defence Budget</h2>
  <p>Pakistan's defence budget has been on an upward trend for the past few years. The country is one of the biggest spenders on defence in South Asia. In the 2020-2021 budget, Pakistan's defence budget was Rs 1.289 trillion, which was around 11.2 percent of the total budget. The 2021-2022 budget saw a 4.1 percent increase in the defence allocation, bringing the total figure to Rs 1.37 trillion.</p>
  <p>The proposed Rs 1.8 trillion allocation for defence in the 2023-24 budget is a 32 percent increase from the previous year's allocation. The proposed allocation is also higher than the combined budgets of Pakistan's education and health ministries.</p>
  <h2>Arguments in Favour of Increased Defence Spending</h2>
  <p>Those in favour of the increased defence spending argue that Pakistan is a country facing multiple security challenges. Pakistan shares borders with India, Afghanistan, and Iran, all of which are politically unstable regions. Moreover, Pakistan is also struggling to handle the rising insurgency in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces.</p>
  <p>The proponents of increased defence spending argue that Pakistan's defence forces require modernisation and up-gradation to combat these challenges. The need for better weapons, facilities, and training justifies the proposed hike.</p>
  <h2>Arguments Against Increased Defence Spending</h2>
  <p>The opponents of the proposed hike in defence spending argue that Pakistan is a country struggling with an economic crisis. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Pakistan's economy is set to contract by 1.5 percent in the current fiscal year. The inflation rate is also rising at an unprecedented rate, which is making life harder for ordinary Pakistanis.</p>
  <p>Investing in development and social sectors could stimulate the economy and create job opportunities. The opponents of the proposed increase argue that the government should channel the funds towards building infrastructure, such as roads and ports, to facilitate trade.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies of Countries that Reduced Defence Spending</h2>
  <p>Many countries have reduced their defence spending to prioritise economic and social development. A few examples of such countries are:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>Costa Rica:</strong> Costa Rica abolished its army in 1948 and invested its resources in education, health, and social security. Today, Costa Rica ranks high on various development indices and has a stable democracy.</li>
   <li><strong>South Korea:</strong> In the 1950s, South Korea was a backward, war-torn country. However, the country redirected its resources towards basic education, infrastructure, and exports, which helped it become a developed economy.</li>
   <li><strong>Germany:</strong> After the end of World War II, Germany dismantled its armed forces and invested in social welfare. Today, Germany is one of the leading economies in the world and has a robust social safety net.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The proposed increase in Pakistan's defence budget has raised concerns about the government's priorities amidst an economic crisis. While Pakistan has legitimate security concerns, it also needs to invest in the development of social sectors to boost the economy and improve the standard of living for its citizens. Looking at the examples of countries such as Costa Rica, South Korea, and Germany, it is apparent that reducing defence spending and redirecting resources towards development and social sectors can have significant long-term benefits.</p>
