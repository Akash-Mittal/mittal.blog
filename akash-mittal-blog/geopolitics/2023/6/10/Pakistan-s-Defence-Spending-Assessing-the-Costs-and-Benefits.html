    <p>In a world where security threats are rapidly evolving, it's no surprise that countries like Pakistan want to increase their military capabilities. However, as the recent budgetary allocation reveals, Pakistan is still prioritizing defence spending even amidst its economic challenges. This begs the question, what are the costs and benefits of such spending, and is it worth it in the long run?</p>
    <p>The answer is not straightforward as it depends on various factors, such as the country's strategic objectives, security challenges, and fiscal constraints. However, we can still draw some insights by examining the experiences of other countries and evaluating Pakistan's track record in defence spending.</p>
    <p>Let's start with a case study of the United States, which spends more on defence than the next ten countries combined. According to a report by the Cost of War Project at Brown University, the US has spent over $2.3 trillion on the War on Terror since 2001, including $822 billion on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. This expenditure has not only strained America's economy but also failed to achieve its intended goals of eradicating terrorism and stabilizing the Middle East region.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, let's look at a case study of China, which has been rapidly increasing its defence spending in recent years, surpassing even the US in some areas. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), China's military expenditure rose by 1.9% in 2020, reaching $252 billion, equivalent to 13% of global military spending. While China claims that its military buildup is defensive and peaceful, it has also been accused of destabilizing the Asia-Pacific region and challenging the US hegemony.</p>
    <p>Now, let's come back to Pakistan and analyze its defence spending. As mentioned earlier, Pakistan has allocated over Rs 1.8 trillion for defence in its recent budget, a 15.5% increase from the previous year, despite facing severe economic challenges, such as high inflation, debt, and unemployment. While the government claims that the increase is necessary for national security and regional stability, some experts have criticized it for being unsustainable and unproductive.</p>
    <p>One of the critiques against Pakistan's defence spending is that it has not brought the desired outcomes in terms of countering terrorism, improving human development, and enhancing regional cooperation. For instance, despite investing billions of dollars in military hardware, Pakistan's military has struggled to eliminate terrorism from its soil and prevent cross-border attacks on its neighbors, such as India and Afghanistan. Furthermore, Pakistan ranks low in human development indicators, such as education, healthcare, and poverty, which could benefit from more public spending.</p>
    <p>Another critique is that Pakistan's defence spending is exacerbating its fiscal imbalances and jeopardizing its long-term economic growth. According to the IMF, Pakistan's fiscal deficit in 2020 reached 8.1% of GDP, and its public debt is projected to reach 94% of GDP by 2023. Furthermore, some analysts argue that Pakistan's military-dominated policy-making has favored defence spending over development and undermined civilian governance.</p>
    <p>Despite these criticisms, some arguments support Pakistan's defence spending. For instance, Pakistan faces significant security challenges, including terrorism, separatism, and border disputes, which require a robust military. Moreover, Pakistan's military has a long history of professional competence and institutional stability, which has helped it maintain a balance of power with India and resist external pressure.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, Pakistan's defence spending has contributed to the development of its defence industry, which has produced indigenous weapons, such as JF-17 Thunder fighter jet and Al-Khalid tank, and provided jobs and technology transfer. Moreover, Pakistan's defence exports have also increased, reaching $212 million in 2020, according to the government.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, Pakistan's defence spending is a complex issue that requires a nuanced assessment of its costs and benefits. While Pakistan's security challenges and domestic pressures demand a strong military, its economic and social needs also require adequate public spending. Therefore, Pakistan needs to strike a balance between its defence and development priorities and ensure that its defence spending is sustainable, transparent, and effective.</p>
