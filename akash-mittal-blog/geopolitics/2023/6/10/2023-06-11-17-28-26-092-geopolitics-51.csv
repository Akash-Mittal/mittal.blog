2023-06-13 11:40 AM;,"As the world reels under the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Pakistan is also facing an economic crisis. In such a scenario, the Pakistan government's proposal to allocate Rs 1.8 trillion for defence in the 2023-24 budget has raised eyebrows and sparked debates.
Pakistan's defence budget has been on an upward trend for the past few years. The country is one of the biggest spenders on defence in South Asia. In the 2020-2021 budget, Pakistan's defence budget was Rs 1.289 trillion, which was around 11.2 percent of the total budget. The 2021-2022 budget saw a 4.1 percent increase in the defence allocation, bringing the total figure to Rs 1.37 trillion.
The proposed Rs 1.8 trillion allocation for defence in the 2023-24 budget is a 32 percent increase from the previous year's allocation. The proposed allocation is also higher than the combined budgets of Pakistan's education and health ministries.
Those in favour of the increased defence spending argue that Pakistan is a country facing multiple security challenges. Pakistan shares borders with India, Afghanistan, and Iran, all of which are politically unstable regions. Moreover, Pakistan is also struggling to handle the rising insurgency in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces.
The proponents of increased defence spending argue that Pakistan's defence forces require modernisation and up-gradation to combat these challenges. The need for better weapons, facilities, and training justifies the proposed hike.

2023-06-13 12:20 PM;,"It was a warm summer day in 2019 when a group of Kazakh entrepreneurs and government officials arrived at the headquarters of the European Union in Brussels. They had come to promote their country as a promising destination for investment and cooperation, and to seek support for their efforts to modernize the Kazakh economy.
As they presented their plan, one of the officials mentioned China's Belt and Road Initiative, a massive infrastructure project that seeks to connect Asia, Europe, and Africa through a network of highways, railways, ports, and pipelines. The Kazakhs knew they were on the crossroads of this project, and that China was eager to invest in their country.
But they also knew that they needed others partners, particularly the EU, to balance China's growing influence and avoid being dominated by its powerful neighbor. They argued that Kazakhstan had a unique role to play in connecting the EU with Asia, and that the EU had a vested interest in helping Kazakhstan to succeed.
The EU officials listened attentively, but remained skeptical. They had heard similar pitches from other countries and knew that Kazakhstan faced many challenges, including corruption, authoritarianism, and an over-reliance on fossil fuels.
Despite these concerns, several former diplomats and experts believe that Kazakhstan is a strategic opportunity for the EU, and that the EU can offer valuable support and incentives to help Kazakhstan to become a more open, prosperous, and democratic country. They offer three reasons why:

2023-06-13 12:40 PM;,"In a global security environment that is more dynamic than ever, quantum technology will emerge as a major frontier in cybersecurity. Quantum computing offers exponential advances in computing speed, which means that it has the potential to break current encryption schemes that protect sensitive data. Countries worldwide, including India, recognize the significance of quantum computing and are investing heavily in developing quantum technology. In this article, we will explore the security implications of quantum computing and how India's National Quantum Mission plans to address them.
To understand the security implications of quantum computing, let us begin with a story about a bank that used financial cryptography to secure its data. The bank thought its data was safe behind a 128-bit key encryption scheme. However, it was shocked to find out that a quantum computer could decipher the encryption within seconds. The bank lost all of its customer's confidential data due to a lack of understanding of the potential danger of quantum computing.
This is not a hypothetical scenario. In 2019, IBM announced the development of a 53-qubit quantum computer, which could perform a calculation in seconds that would take a traditional computer years to complete. This computing power can be used to break the encryption used in security protocols such as HTTPS, which is used to protect sensitive data such as passwords and financial information.
Another case study is the 2018 data breach of Under Armour's fitness app, MyFitnessPal. The breach exposed 150 million user accounts containing sensitive data such as usernames, email addresses, and passwords. The company's encryption used to protect the data was 128-bit SHA-1, which is vulnerable to quantum computing attacks.
India recognizes the potential of quantum technology and launched its National Quantum Mission in 2020. The mission aims to develop quantum technology in areas such as cybersecurity, communication, and computing. It aims to create a workforce with the skills to work in quantum technology, develop quantum computing infrastructure, and encourage research in the field.

It has a thriving economy and ambitious projects aimed at enhancing its infrastructure and developing its tourism industry. Such a country exists, and it is Kazakhstan.
However, this former Soviet Republic has been relatively unknown to the West, and its geopolitical importance has often been overlooked. Nevertheless, recent developments have caught the attention of foreign diplomats, who have recognized the untapped potential that exists between Kazakhstan and the EU.
According to former diplomats, Kazakhstan is an essential partner for the EU. The country is located in a geopolitical hotspot that is often overlooked by Western countries, and its economy is growing rapidly. The EU has acknowledged the potential that exists between the two parties and has recently signed a new agreement that will strengthen their cooperation even further.
The agreement aims to enhance dialogue between the EU and Kazakhstan and improve cooperation in areas such as energy, trade, and environment. It also seeks to promote human rights, rule of law, and democratic principles. The EU recognizes the value of Kazakhstan's location and sees the country as a gateway to Central Asia.
Kazakhstan's diplomatic relations with the EU have been vital to its development and international standing. For example, the EU has provided training to Kazakh judges and has also helped the country to adopt European environmental standards. Furthermore, the EU has helped Kazakhstan to develop its tourism industry, which is an area of strategic importance for the country.

The international community has been trying to solve the crisis for years, but the rivalry between the U.S. and China has been hindering the efforts. Both countries have their own agenda, and they are using the Rohingya crisis as a pawn in their power struggle.
The United States has been actively involved in advocating for the rights of the Rohingya people. In 2017, when the crisis was at its peak, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Myanmar's military leaders and halted military aid. The U.S. has also been pushing for an international inquiry into the atrocities committed against the Rohingya people.
On the other hand, China has been supporting the Myanmar government and has opposed any intervention from the international community. China has invested heavily in Myanmar's infrastructure projects, and the Rohingya crisis is seen as a disturbance to their plans.
The Rohingya crisis is not just a humanitarian crisis, but it also has political and economic implications. The Rohingya people have been deprived of basic human rights, including citizenship and the right to education and healthcare. This has led to a loss of potential manpower and human capital for Myanmar and neighboring countries.

2023-06-13 02:00 PM;,"When the Chinese government started cracking down on video game companies in 2018, the stock prices of Tencent and NetEase dropped, sparking a significant investor frenzy. The reason was the government's new regulation that required every game to be approved by the State Administration of Press and Publications before it could be published, resulting in a halt of the approval process.
The United States and China's relationship has influenced investors several times in recent years, creating significant political risks that investors must be aware of. This article will examine how the two countries' relationship affects investors and point out the risks involved. Some case studies will also be discussed in addition to the three key conclusions drawn at the end of the article.
The relationship between the United States and China has been up and down for the past decade. China's rise to become one of America's biggest trade partners caused worries in the US, especially after the trade deficit that grew to $419 billion in 2018. The pandemic also intensified the worries that the US had regarding China, which led to the US-China trade war that lasted from 2018-2020. During this period, tariffs were imposed on each country's imports and exports to each other.
The tensions between the two countries didn't end with the trade war. There are also issues on human rights violations in China, like the Chinese government's treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, and Beijing's encroachment on Hong Kong's autonomy. These human rights concerns have raised questions regarding US companies' use of Chinese factories and businesses.
The US-China relationship is a crucial consideration for investors because it affects the profits and value of companies that operate globally. The political risks that emerge from the US-China relationship imply the possibility of losing profits if a company loses access to a major market like China.

The moment was terrifying for Akbar as he knew that the political tensions between the two countries could impact his hope of returning to his homeland in Myanmar.
The ongoing rivalry between the US and China has been impacting global politics and economics. However, it should not hamper the efforts to find a sustainable solution to the Rohingya crisis. The crisis started when the Myanmar military launched a brutal crackdown on the Rohingya community, driving over 700,000 people to seek refuge in neighboring Bangladesh. Since then, several international efforts have been made to repatriate the refugees to their homeland, but none of them have been successful so far.
In recent times, the US-China rivalry has intensified, and both countries are actively involved in the global politics of the Asian continent. Myanmar, being a neighbor to both countries, is a crucial geostrategic location for them. China has been investing heavily in Myanmar's infrastructure, while the US is trying to counter China's influence by promoting human rights and democracy in the country. This has put the Rohingya crisis on the backburner for both countries, hindering the progress of any meaningful solution.
Another example of the impact of geopolitical tensions on the Rohingya crisis is the role of the United Nations. The UN has been working tirelessly to ensure a safe and dignified repatriation process for the refugees. However, the recent tussle between the US and China over the UN's budget allocation has made it difficult for the organization to work effectively. China has accused the US of using the UN for its political ambitions, while the US has criticized China for not contributing enough to the organization's budget. This has put a strain on the UN's capacity to deal with the Rohingya crisis effectively.
Despite the geopolitical tensions, there have been some positive developments in recent times. China has started showing interest in finding a solution to the Rohingya crisis, and the US has been pushing for a democratic transition in Myanmar. However, these efforts need to be intensified, and both countries should work together towards a common goal of finding a sustainable solution to the crisis. The Rohingya community has already suffered enough and deserves a chance to return to their homeland with dignity and safety.

2023-06-13 02:40 PM;,"It's day 3 of the World Test Championship (WTC) Final and Australia are already in a commanding position. After winning the toss on day 1, Indian skipper Rohit Sharma chose to bowl but his decision didn't pay off as Australia scored 332 runs in the first innings. India could only manage 217 runs in response. And now, in the second innings, Australia have a lead of 296 runs with 6 wickets in hand.
This is not the first time that India has struggled in Test cricket. In fact, India's away record in Test cricket has never been impressive. They have lost more Test series than they have won outside of Asia. The reasons for this are many, including the lack of quality pacers, inability to adapt to overseas conditions and a lack of preparation.
One of the biggest issues that India faces in Test cricket is the lack of quality pacers. In the past, India relied heavily on their spinners to win matches at home, but the same strategy doesn't work overseas. India's pace attack has always been a concern, especially when playing in countries like Australia, South Africa and England where the pitches offer more bounce and swing. In contrast, Australia has always been known for their formidable pace attack, which makes it difficult for the opposition batsmen to score runs.
For example, in the ongoing WTC Final, India's pace bowlers have struggled to make an impact. In the first innings, they managed to take only 3 wickets, whereas Australia's pacers picked up 9 wickets. This clearly shows the difference in the quality of the two teams' pace attacks.
Another issue that India faces in Test cricket is the inability to adapt to overseas conditions. In home conditions, India is a dominant force, but the same cannot be said about their performances overseas. Indian teams have always struggled to adapt to the conditions in countries like Australia, South Africa and England where the pitches offer more swing and bounce. The Indian batsmen have often been found wanting against good quality pace bowling on these pitches.
