  <!-- Interesting story -->
  <p>It was a cool evening in a small village of Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. Akbar, a Rohingya refugee, was sitting with his family outside his makeshift tent. Suddenly, he heard a loud noise from afar. As he looked towards the source of the sound, he saw two fighter jets of the US and China engaging in a dogfight. The moment was terrifying for Akbar as he knew that the political tensions between the two countries could impact his hope of returning to his homeland in Myanmar.</p><!-- Examples with case studies -->
  <h2>Why US-China Rivalry Should Not Affect Bringing Solution to Rohingya Crisis</h2>
  <p>The ongoing rivalry between the US and China has been impacting global politics and economics. However, it should not hamper the efforts to find a sustainable solution to the Rohingya crisis. The crisis started when the Myanmar military launched a brutal crackdown on the Rohingya community, driving over 700,000 people to seek refuge in neighboring Bangladesh. Since then, several international efforts have been made to repatriate the refugees to their homeland, but none of them have been successful so far.</p>
  <p>In recent times, the US-China rivalry has intensified, and both countries are actively involved in the global politics of the Asian continent. Myanmar, being a neighbor to both countries, is a crucial geostrategic location for them. China has been investing heavily in Myanmar's infrastructure, while the US is trying to counter China's influence by promoting human rights and democracy in the country. This has put the Rohingya crisis on the backburner for both countries, hindering the progress of any meaningful solution.</p>
  <p>Another example of the impact of geopolitical tensions on the Rohingya crisis is the role of the United Nations. The UN has been working tirelessly to ensure a safe and dignified repatriation process for the refugees. However, the recent tussle between the US and China over the UN's budget allocation has made it difficult for the organization to work effectively. China has accused the US of using the UN for its political ambitions, while the US has criticized China for not contributing enough to the organization's budget. This has put a strain on the UN's capacity to deal with the Rohingya crisis effectively.</p>
  <p>Despite the geopolitical tensions, there have been some positive developments in recent times. China has started showing interest in finding a solution to the Rohingya crisis, and the US has been pushing for a democratic transition in Myanmar. However, these efforts need to be intensified, and both countries should work together towards a common goal of finding a sustainable solution to the crisis. The Rohingya community has already suffered enough and deserves a chance to return to their homeland with dignity and safety.</p><!-- Conclusion in 3 points -->
