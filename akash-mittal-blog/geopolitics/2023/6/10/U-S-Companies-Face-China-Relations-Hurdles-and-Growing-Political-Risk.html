  <p>When the Chinese government started cracking down on video game companies in 2018, the stock prices of Tencent and NetEase dropped, sparking a significant investor frenzy. The reason was the government's new regulation that required every game to be approved by the State Administration of Press and Publications before it could be published, resulting in a halt of the approval process.</p>
  <p>The United States and China's relationship has influenced investors several times in recent years, creating significant political risks that investors must be aware of. This article will examine how the two countries' relationship affects investors and point out the risks involved. Some case studies will also be discussed in addition to the three key conclusions drawn at the end of the article.</p><!--Section 1: US-China Relations-->
  <h2>US-China Relations</h2>
  <p>The relationship between the United States and China has been up and down for the past decade. China's rise to become one of America's biggest trade partners caused worries in the US, especially after the trade deficit that grew to $419 billion in 2018. The pandemic also intensified the worries that the US had regarding China, which led to the US-China trade war that lasted from 2018-2020. During this period, tariffs were imposed on each country's imports and exports to each other.</p>
  <p>The tensions between the two countries didn't end with the trade war. There are also issues on human rights violations in China, like the Chinese government's treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, and Beijing's encroachment on Hong Kong's autonomy. These human rights concerns have raised questions regarding US companies' use of Chinese factories and businesses.</p><!--Section 2: Political Risks for Investors-->
  <h2>Political Risks for Investors</h2>
  <p>The US-China relationship is a crucial consideration for investors because it affects the profits and value of companies that operate globally. The political risks that emerge from the US-China relationship imply the possibility of losing profits if a company loses access to a major market like China.</p>
  <p>For example, US semiconductor companies have been experiencing the effects of the US-China trade war. If the US government stops US semiconductor companies from exporting to China, then these companies will lose money. The Chinese market is critical because China is the largest consumer of semiconductors in the world, accounting for 32% of the worldwide market.</p>
  <p>Companies like Apple, which manufacture their products in China, found themselves in deep water when the US government enacted the additional 15 % tariffs on apparel, electronics, and shoes. Since the tariffs led to higher manufacturing costs, Apple had to raise the prices of their iPhones in order to keep their profit margins. Therefore, the continuously changing policies and trade regulations can destabilize the included companies' growth prospects, making a pre-investment study mandatory for investors to avoid unexpected losses.</p><!--Section 3: Case Studies-->
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <h3>Tencent and NetEase</h3>
  <p>As stated earlier, when the State Administration of Press and Publications in China halted the approval process for video game companies in 2018, Tencent and NetEase's stock prices dropped considerably. Tencent's stock price dropped by 32% in just seven months. The companies had to halt all new approvals, leaving companies with no idea when their games would be reviewed. When approvals started again, they faced stricter rules, which caused many small game companies to shut down.</p>
  <h3>Boeing</h3>
  <p>Boeing, an American aerospace company, had to bear losses due to the US-China trade war that lasted from 2018-2020. China is one of Boeing's most significant markets for aircraftâ€”China ordered 600 planes, which were worth a whopping $33bn before the start of the trade war. However, during the trade war, China cut all orders and started purchasing planes from Boeing's competitor, Airbus.</p><!--Section 4: Conclusion-->
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The US-China relationship creates a political risk that investors in global firms should be aware of. Companies that operate in China can be affected by several factors, including changing trade policies, tariffs, human rights concerns, and changing regulations.</p>
  <p>Investors must have a thorough pre-investment study about the risks and opportunities of the affairs involved in the two countries. The following three conclusions can be made based on this article:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The US-China relationship is volatile, and investors must bear that in mind while investing in companies that operate between the two countries.</li>
   <li>Companies that solely depend on the Chinese market need to devise a backup plan in case access to the market is blocked.</li>
   <li>Investors must keep track of the changing policies and regulations on both sides to avoid significant losses.</li>
