  <p>It was a bright and sunny day in Mumbai when the city was rocked by a series of bombs on July 11, 2006. Over 200 people were killed and more than 700 were injured in the coordinated terror attacks on suburban trains. The attacks were masterminded by the Pakistan-based terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).</p>
  <p>For years, India had been fighting a war against terrorism emanating from Pakistan. The Mumbai attacks were a turning point in India's fight against terrorism. The government realized that it needed to take a more aggressive stance against Pakistan and its state-sponsored terrorism.</p>
  <p>In a recent speech, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar highlighted the significant achievements of the Modi government over the past nine years in delegitimising Pakistan's terror activities. Here are some of the key insights from his speech:</p>
  <h2>Pakistan's State-Sponsored Terrorism</h2>
  <p>For decades, Pakistan has been using terrorism as a state policy to bleed India with a thousand cuts. Starting from the early 1980s, Pakistan started providing support to various terrorist groups in India, including the Kashmiri separatists.</p>
  <p>These groups operated with impunity from the Pakistani soil, and the Pakistani establishment provided them with safe havens, training, and financial support. Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) played a key role in orchestrating these terror attacks.</p>
  <p>India had been highlighting Pakistan's state-sponsored terrorism at various international forums, but it failed to garner much support. Pakistan's diplomatic and military might, coupled with its strategic location and backing by China, made it difficult for India to isolate Pakistan on the world stage.</p>
  <h2>India's Response</h2>
  <p>The Modi government took a proactive approach to delegitimise Pakistan's terror activities. It intensified the military and diplomatic pressure on Pakistan and exposed its terrorist activities at various international forums.</p>
  <p>India also launched surgical strikes against terror camps across the Line of Control (LoC) that separates Indian and Pakistani-administered Kashmir. These strikes showed India's resolve to retaliate against Pakistani terror attacks and gave a clear message to Pakistan that India would not tolerate any cross-border terrorism.</p>
  <p>India also pursued a policy of isolating Pakistan on the world stage. It highlighted Pakistan's links with terror groups and its non-cooperation in bringing the masterminds of the Mumbai attacks to justice. India's efforts bore fruit as several countries, including the United States, started pressurising Pakistan to take action against terror groups operating from its soil.</p>
  <h2>Impact of India's Approach</h2>
  <p>India's proactive approach to delegitimise Pakistan's terror activities has had a significant impact. Pakistan's diplomatic isolation and financial squeeze have made it difficult for it to continue its state-sponsored terrorism. The terrorist groups that were once thriving with the support of the Pakistani establishment are now finding it difficult to operate.</p>
  <p>The surgical strikes and the international pressure have also sent a clear message to Pakistan that India would not tolerate any more terror attacks. Pakistan has been forced to reassess its strategy and has toned down its rhetoric of bleeding India with a thousand cuts.</p>
  <p>India's approach has also helped in improving its global standing. The world has now realized the threat posed by Pakistan's state-sponsored terrorism, and many countries have started supporting India's stance. India's efforts have exposed Pakistan's true face, and it has become increasingly difficult for Pakistan to hide its terror activities.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>India's proactive approach to delegitimise Pakistan's terror activities has shown results. Pakistan's diplomatic isolation and financial squeeze have made it difficult for it to continue its state-sponsored terrorism. The surgical strikes and the international pressure have sent a clear message to Pakistan that India would not tolerate any more terror attacks.</p>
  <p>India's efforts have also helped in improving its global standing. However, India needs to remain vigilant and continue its efforts to delegitimise Pakistan's terror activities. India needs to work with the international community to ensure that Pakistan is held accountable for its actions and that the masterminds of terror attacks are brought to justice.</p>
