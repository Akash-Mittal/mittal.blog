   <p>Basit Ali, the former Pakistani cricketer, has recently raised questions about the coaching abilities of Indian cricket legend Rahul Dravid. In an interview with a news channel after the World Test Championship (WTC) final, Basit Ali expressed his disappointment with Team India's performance and the tactics used by the team management.</p>
   <p>This is not the first time that Basit Ali has questioned the Indian team. However, his latest remarks have stirred up a controversy in the cricketing world. Many Indian fans and ex-players have criticized Basit Ali for his comments, while others have defended his right to express his opinions.</p>
   <h2>Examples with Case Studies</h2>
   <p>Basit Ali's criticism of Team India's tactics is derived from the team management's decision to play two spinners in the WTC final. Many experts had predicted that the seam-friendly conditions in Southampton would favor India's fast bowlers. However, the team management decided to go with two spinners, who failed to make an impact in the match. Basit Ali believes that this decision was a major factor in India's loss to New Zealand in the final.</p>
   <p>Another aspect of Basit Ali's criticism is directed towards Rahul Dravid's coaching abilities. Dravid, who has recently taken over as the head coach of the Indian team, is regarded as one of the greatest batsmen to have played the game. However, Basit Ali questions whether Dravid has the skills and experience to coach a team at the highest level. He believes that Dravid's lack of coaching experience may be a hindrance to the team's success.</p>
   <p>While Basit Ali's comments may seem harsh, they do raise some valid points. There have been instances in the past where the Indian team's tactics and team selection have been criticized by experts and fans alike. Similarly, while Dravid is highly respected in the cricketing world, there are concerns about his lack of coaching experience.</p>
