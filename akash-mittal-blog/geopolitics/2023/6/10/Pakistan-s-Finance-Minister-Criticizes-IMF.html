    <p>In a world where international institutions hold great power, it is no surprise to see countries at odds with them. However, the IMF's recent treatment of Pakistan has led to the country's finance minister, Ishaq Dar, describing it as "totally unfair".</p>
    <p>The IMF delayed the bailout program for Pakistan, despite the country being in dire need of financial assistance. In recent times Pakistan has faced economic turmoil and Dar believes that the IMF has contributed to this.</p>
    <h2>Examples of IMF's Treatment</h2>
    <p>A case in point is the highly controversial Zero Tolerance Policy that was implemented by the IMF in Pakistan in 2019. This policy effectively meant that all projects that were not included in the budget were to be shut down, causing a lot of economic damage in the country. Even though the Pakistani government made efforts to convince the IMF to modify this policy, it was unsuccessful.</p>
    <p>Another example is the IMF's insistence on imposing austerity measures on Pakistan as part of a bailout package in 2018. Though it was intended to bring financial stability, this decision resulted in a significant increase in inflation, job losses, and the cost of living.</p>
    <h2>The Impact of IMF's Actions on Pakistan</h2>
    <p>The IMF's actions have had a significant impact on the people of Pakistan. Due to the implementation of the austerity measures, education and healthcare have become inaccessible to many, and it has resulted in a rise in poverty. According to a report by the United Nations Development Programme, Pakistan has the highest multidimensional poverty rate in South Asia, with 39% of its population living in poverty.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The IMF's treatment of Pakistan has caused great harm to the country and its people. While international institutions such as the IMF can provide vital financial assistance to countries in need, it is essential that they work together with governments to ensure that the policies implemented do not exacerbate existing problems and cause more harm. It is time to rethink the current approach to financial assistance and develop policies that benefit all parties involved, rather than furthering the interests of the powerful few.</p>
