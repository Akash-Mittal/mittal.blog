  <h1>The Rise of Kazakhstan: A Geopolitical Opportunity for the EU</h1></br> <img src="images/The-Rise-of-Kazakhstan-A-Geopolitical-Opportunity-for-the-EU.jpeg" alt="+The-Rise-of-Kazakhstan-A-Geopolitical-Opportunity-for-the-EU+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/central-asia/news/western-pundits-offer-advice-on-kazakh-geopolitics/" target="_blank" href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/central-asia/news/western-pundits-offer-advice-on-kazakh-geopolitics/" rel="noopener">https://www.euractiv.com/section/central-asia/news/western-pundits-offer-advice-on-kazakh-geopolitics/</a></span></h5>
  <p>It was a warm summer day in 2019 when a group of Kazakh entrepreneurs and government officials arrived at the headquarters of the European Union in Brussels. They had come to promote their country as a promising destination for investment and cooperation, and to seek support for their efforts to modernize the Kazakh economy.</p>
  <p>As they presented their plan, one of the officials mentioned China's Belt and Road Initiative, a massive infrastructure project that seeks to connect Asia, Europe, and Africa through a network of highways, railways, ports, and pipelines. The Kazakhs knew they were on the crossroads of this project, and that China was eager to invest in their country.</p>
  <p>But they also knew that they needed others partners, particularly the EU, to balance China's growing influence and avoid being dominated by its powerful neighbor. They argued that Kazakhstan had a unique role to play in connecting the EU with Asia, and that the EU had a vested interest in helping Kazakhstan to succeed.</p>
  <p>The EU officials listened attentively, but remained skeptical. They had heard similar pitches from other countries and knew that Kazakhstan faced many challenges, including corruption, authoritarianism, and an over-reliance on fossil fuels.</p>
  <p>Despite these concerns, several former diplomats and experts believe that Kazakhstan is a strategic opportunity for the EU, and that the EU can offer valuable support and incentives to help Kazakhstan to become a more open, prosperous, and democratic country. They offer three reasons why:</p>
  <h2>1. Kazakhstan is a bridge between Europe and Asia</h2>
  <p>Kazakhstan is the ninth largest country in the world, and the largest in Central Asia, with a population of 18 million. It borders Russia to the north, China to the east, and has long borders with four other Central Asian countries, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and then Caspian sea as its big maritime guarantee. It is strategically located at the crossing of the continental axis of Eurasia, where the north-south axis meets the east-west axis. This makes Kazakhstan an important transit hub for trade, transportation, and energy flows between Europe and Asia.</p>
  <p>The EU and Kazakhstan have already developed extensive economic ties, with the EU being Kazakhstan's second largest trading partner after Russia, accounting for 40% of Kazakhstan's total trade. The EU is also the largest foreign investor in Kazakhstan, with more than 50 billion euros in cumulative investment since 2005.</p>
  <p>The EU and Kazakhstan have signed a comprehensive Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (EPCA) that commits both sides to deepen their political, economic, and cultural relations. The EPCA includes provisions on human rights, democracy, and rule of law, which are areas where Kazakhstan has faced criticism in the past.</p>
  <p>However, more needs to be done to fully exploit the potential of this partnership. The EU and Kazakhstan should work together to improve the infrastructure and logistics of the Eurasian corridor, to reduce trade barriers, and to promote people-to-people contacts and cultural exchanges.</p>
  <h2>2. Kazakhstan is a key player in the energy market</h2>
  <p>Kazakhstan has significant oil, gas, and mineral reserves, and is one of the world's largest producers of uranium, copper, and zinc. Its oil exports go mainly to China, but also to Europe, and it has ambitions to become a major player in the global energy market.</p>
  <p>The EU is keen to diversify its energy sources and reduce its dependence on Russia, which supplies around 40% of the gas imported by the EU. Kazakhstan offers an attractive alternative, with its vast reserves of oil, gas, and uranium, and its proximity to Europe.</p>
  <p>Kazakhstan has already started to develop its renewable energy sector, and has set a target of producing 50% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2050. The EU can support these efforts by providing technical assistance, investment, and expertise in areas such as energy efficiency, smart grids, and renewable energy technologies.</p>
  <p>Moreover, the EU and Kazakhstan can work together to promote sustainable development and reduce the negative impact of extractive industries on the environment and local communities.</p>
  <h2>3. Kazakhstan is a potential stabilizing force in the region</h2>
  <p>Kazakhstan is a multi-ethnic and multi-religious society, with a moderate, secular form of Islam. It has managed to maintain peace and stability despite its diverse population and its location in a volatile region. It has also played a constructive role in regional and international affairs, including as a mediator in the Ukrainian crisis and as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.</p>
  <p>The EU can support Kazakhstan's efforts to promote peace, stability, and cooperation in the region by providing assistance and expertise in areas such as conflict prevention, democracy, and human rights. The EU can also work with Kazakhstan to address common challenges, such as terrorism, organized crime, and drug trafficking, which threaten the security of both the EU and Kazakhstan.</p>
  <p>By promoting dialogue and cooperation between the EU and Kazakhstan, and by encouraging Kazakhstan to become more open, democratic, and connected to the world, the EU can help to create a more stable and prosperous region, and to balance China's growing influence.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The rise of Kazakhstan presents a unique opportunity for the EU to expand and diversify its relations with Central Asia, and to promote economic, political, and security cooperation in the region. By working with Kazakhstan to address common challenges and to seize common opportunities, the EU can help to create a more balanced and resilient world order, and to advance its own strategic interests in Eurasia.</p>
