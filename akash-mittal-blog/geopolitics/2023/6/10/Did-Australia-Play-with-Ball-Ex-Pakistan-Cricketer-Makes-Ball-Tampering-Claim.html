   <p>Cricket is a game that is loved by millions of fans all over the world. It is a sport that demands precision, skill, and fair play. However, in recent years, there have been several instances of ball tampering that have tarnished the reputation of the game. The latest controversy involves Australia, who are accused of playing with the ball during their recent match with India.</p>
   <p>Ex-Pakistani cricketer Basit Ali has made a shocking claim that the Australians tampered with the ball during their match against India. Speaking on his YouTube channel, Ali pointed out how the Aussies 'made the ball' around the 15th over and that helped them get rid of India's Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Ball Tampering in Cricket</h2>
   <p>Ball tampering is a serious offence in cricket. It involves altering the condition of the ball using foreign objects like sandpaper, nails, or bottle caps in order to gain an unfair advantage. There have been several instances of ball tampering in the history of cricket, some of which have caused major controversies and led to severe punishments.</p>
   <h3>Case Study 1: The Sandpaper Gate</h3>
   <p>The most infamous case of ball tampering in recent years is the Sandpaper Gate involving the Australian cricket team. The incident occurred during the third Test against South Africa in Cape Town in March 2018. Cameron Bancroft, who was fielding at the time, was caught on camera using sandpaper to alter the condition of the ball. The revelation led to a huge uproar, and the Australian captain Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner were stripped of their positions. Bancroft was also banned for nine months, while Smith and Warner were banned for a year each.</p>
   <h3>Case Study 2: The Bottle Cap Gate</h3>
   <p>In 2006, the Pakistan cricket team was accused of ball tampering during a Test match against England. The team's captain, Inzamam-ul-Haq, refused to take the field after the umpires awarded five penalty runs to England and changed the ball. It was later revealed that a member of the Pakistan team had used a bottle cap to tamper with the ball. The incident led to a lot of drama, and the match had to be forfeited by Pakistan.</p>
   <h3>Case Study 3: The Mint Gate</h3>
   <p>In 2016, the Indian cricket team was embroiled in a controversy during a Test match against England. Television cameras caught Indian skipper Virat Kohli using a mint to shine the ball. The incident led to a lot of debate, as the rules regarding the use of mints were unclear. In the end, Kohli was let off with a warning, and the issue was resolved without any major fallout.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>Ball tampering is a serious issue in cricket, and it is important that all teams play the game in a fair and transparent manner. The recent allegations against Australia are concerning, and it remains to be seen what action will be taken by the authorities. It is also important that all players understand the rules regarding ball tampering and adhere to them at all times.</p>
