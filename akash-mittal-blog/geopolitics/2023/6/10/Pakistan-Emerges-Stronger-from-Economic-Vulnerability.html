  <p></p>
  <p>Pakistan's Finance Minister, Ishaq Dar, recently announced that the country has finally moved out of its economic vulnerability phase. Gone are the days of high inflation rates, revenue shortfalls, and balance of payment issues that have kept the nation on shaky grounds for years. The announcement came after a successful financial quarter where Pakistan managed to stabilize its economy and achieve satisfactory economic growth.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>A few years back, the situation in Pakistan was significantly different. The country's inflation rate was skyrocketing, surpassing the 25% level in some sectors. Shortages of energy and inadequate infrastructure led to low confidence in the country's investment climate, precisely when the world was in a financial crisis. International investors were wary of the situation in Pakistan due to its political instability, energy crisis, security issues, and poor state of human development.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>However, the tide has now turned. Pakistan's economy has grown so much that it is now on a path to being recognized as a 'new emerging market.' The World Bank states that Pakistan's GNI (Gross national income) per capita has jumped from $450 in 2012 to $1,023 in 2020. Inflation rates are significantly lower, and the infrastructure in the country has improved. Furthermore, with the new government policies aimed at improving the economic climate and attracting foreign investment, Pakistan is finally seeing a stable overall economic situation.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Pakistan's Economic Growth</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Pakistan's economic growth has been showing a steady rise over the last decade. With better economic policies and the introduction of CPEC (China-Pakistan Economic Corridor), the country has seen significant improvements in its economy. CPEC and its associated projects have undoubtedly played a crucial role in promoting the country's economic growth.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>CPEC is a joint project between China and Pakistan aimed at developing infrastructure and other strategic projects. The investment has not only paved the way for economic growth but also brought some environmental improvements in the Energy sector. Earlier, the country was heavily reliant on non-renewable energy, leading to high Carbon dioxide emissions contributing to global warming. With CPEC investments, the country has been shifting towards renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. As a result, Pakistan's environmental impact has reduced by a great deal.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The Economic Impact on Pakistani Citizens</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The positive economic climate has impacted every Pakistani's life. Infrastructure development and the introduction of various national projects means that citizens can expect better healthcare facilities, better roads, improved modes of transportation, and job security.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The success stories of Pakistan's economy are encouraging to see. Pakistan's economic stability does not just benefit its citizens; it has the potential to create a ripple effect throughout the entire region. With Pakistan's growing stability and foreign investments, the country has the chance to provide a stable platform for startups and entrepreneurs.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Pakistan has emerged from its economic vulnerability phase to an era of growth and political stability. With the many national and international investments in the country, Pakistan has created a platform for entrepreneurship, improved infrastructure, and a stable economic climate. The positive changes in Pakistan should be celebrated and recognized as a big leap forward for the country.</p>
