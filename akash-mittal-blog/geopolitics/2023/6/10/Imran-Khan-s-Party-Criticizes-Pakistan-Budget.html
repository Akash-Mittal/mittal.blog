  <h1>Imran Khan's Party Criticizes Pakistan Budget</h1></br> <img src="images/Imran-Khan-s-Party-Criticizes-Pakistan-Budget.jpeg" alt="+Imran-Khan-s-Party-Criticizes-Pakistan-Budget+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://m.timesofindia.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-budget-targets-artificial-non-realistic-says-imran-khans-party/articleshow/100893923.cms" target="_blank" href="https://m.timesofindia.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-budget-targets-artificial-non-realistic-says-imran-khans-party/articleshow/100893923.cms" rel="noopener">https://m.timesofindia.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-budget-targets-artificial-non-realistic-says-imran-khans-party/articleshow/100893923.cms</a></span></h5>
  <p>On Friday, the Pakistan government unveiled a Rs 14.4 trillion budget for 2023-24 to combat a looming default due to shrinking foreign reserves. However, Imran Khan's political party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), has criticized the budget, calling it "artificial" and "non-realistic."</p>
  
  <p>In 2018, Imran Khan's PTI came to power, promising to turn the country's struggling economy around. However, nearly three years later, Pakistan's economic situation remains dire, with high inflation, a growing debt burden, and unemployment on the rise.</p>
  <p>Amid this backdrop, the government presented its budget for the next fiscal year, hoping to address these issues. However, the PTI has called the budget unrealistic, arguing that it relies too heavily on revenue targets that are unlikely to be met.</p>
  <h2>Examples and Case Studies</h2>
  <p>The PTI's criticism of the budget is not unfounded. In recent years, Pakistan has struggled to meet revenue targets, despite implementing various tax reforms and crackdowns on corruption.</p>
  <p>According to a report by The Express Tribune, Pakistan's Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) missed its tax collection target in 2020-21, falling short by nearly Rs 600 billion. This shortfall has put further pressure on the government's finances, which are already stretched thin.</p>
  <p>Moreover, many experts have pointed out that the government's revenue projections for the next fiscal year are optimistic, given the current economic situation. As an article in Dawn notes, the budget assumes a 10.2% growth in tax revenue, which is unlikely to materialize unless there is a significant improvement in the economy.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Overall, the PTI's criticism of the Pakistan budget is not unwarranted. While the government has presented a plan to address the country's economic woes, it remains to be seen whether the revenue targets will be met.</p>
  <p>As Pakistan continues to grapple with its economic challenges, it will be important for the government to implement policies that are both realistic and sustainable, in order to promote long-term growth and stability.</p>
