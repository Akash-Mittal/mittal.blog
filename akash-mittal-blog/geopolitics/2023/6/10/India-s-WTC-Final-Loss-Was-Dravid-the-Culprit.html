   <h2>Ex-Pakistan cricketer slams Team India Head coach for his poor tactics during WTC final</h2>

   <p>It was a nail-biting showdown at the Ageas Bowl in Southampton, where India and New Zealand fought tooth and nail for the title of champions of the inaugural World Test Championship (WTC). However, in the end, it was the Kiwis who emerged victorious.</p>
   <p>The loss left Indian fans and cricket pundits scratching their heads, trying to figure out what went wrong. Some pointed fingers at the team's poor performance, while others blamed it on the conditions. But one person, in particular, had some scathing remarks to make about Team India's head coach, Rahul Dravid.</p>
   <p>The former Pakistan cricketer, Tanvir Ahmed, who is now a coach himself, took a dig at Dravid, referring to him as "absolutely zero". In an interview with a Pakistani news channel, he suggested that Dravid was unable to comprehend India's strategy and that his poor tactics during the WTC final cost India the game.</p>
   <p>Now, whether or not Dravid was the sole reason for India's defeat is up for debate, but what cannot be denied is the impact a coach has on a team's performance. Let's take a look at some case studies to understand this better.</p>
   <h3>Case Study 1: India under Gary Kirsten</h3>
   <p>When Gary Kirsten took over as India's head coach in 2008, the team was struggling with consistency. However, under his guidance, India went on to win the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup. Kirsten's calm and composed demeanor, coupled with his focus on mental preparation, helped the team overcome their weaknesses and emerge victorious.</p>
   <h3>Case Study 2: Australia under John Buchanan</h3>
   <p>John Buchanan took over as Australia's head coach in 1999, and over the next decade, he built a team that dominated world cricket. Buchanan's unconventional coaching methods, such as introducing the "guru" system and using sports psychology, helped the team achieve sustained success.</p>
   <h3>Case Study 3: West Indies under Phil Simmons</h3>
   <p>Phil Simmons took over as the head coach of West Indies in 2015, and he immediately faced challenges, as the team was struggling to compete at the international level. However, Simmons worked hard on identifying and grooming young talent, and under his coaching, West Indies won their second T20 World Cup in 2016.</p>
   <p>These case studies show that a coach's impact on a team cannot be overlooked. However, it is also important to understand that a coach is only one part of the equation, and it takes a collective effort from the players, support staff, and management to achieve success.</p>
   <h3>Conclusion</h3>
   <p>In conclusion, while Tanvir Ahmed's remarks about Rahul Dravid may seem harsh, they do raise an important question - how much of an impact did Dravid have on India's performance in the WTC final? It is unfair to put all the blame on one person, but it is equally unfair to ignore the role a coach plays in a team's success. It is up to the Indian cricket board to analyze the team's performance and make the necessary changes to ensure that they continue to compete at the highest level.</p>
