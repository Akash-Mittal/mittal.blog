   <h2>A Tale of Two Predictions</h2>
   <p>Geopolitical forecasting is a tricky business, often characterized by uncertainty, ambiguity, and error. As someone who has spent years studying and practicing strategic foresight, I can attest to the challenges of trying to anticipate the future of world affairs. But I can also attest to the rewards of getting it right.</p>
   <p>Two cases come to mind when I think about my successes and failures in predicting global events. The first is Egypt's 2011 revolution against former President Hosni Mubarak. In 2010, I had written a report arguing that Egypt was likely to experience a political crisis within the next decade, due to a combination of economic stagnation, social unrest, and political repression. I had based my analysis on numerous indicators, including government corruption, youth unemployment, food inflation, and popular protests.</p>
   <p>When the Arab Spring erupted in Tunisia at the end of 2010, I knew that Egypt was ripe for a similar uprising. I vividly remember watching the protests unfold in Cairo's Tahrir Square on live TV, feeling a mixture of excitement and anxiety. When Mubarak stepped down in February 2011, I felt vindicated in my prediction. I had correctly identified the underlying drivers of change in Egypt and the region and had anticipated the possibility of a regime change.</p>
   <p>The second case is Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014. In 2012, I had written another report arguing that Russia was unlikely to take military action against Ukraine, despite Moscow's concerns about NATO expansion and Ukraine's pro-Western orientation. I had based my analysis on several factors, including Russia's economic constraints, Ukraine's strategic importance, and the potential diplomatic costs of a military intervention.</p>
   <p>When Russia annexed Crimea in March 2014, I was shocked and disappointed. I had failed to anticipate the depth of Russia's grievances towards Ukraine, the potency of its propaganda campaign, and the weakness of Western sanctions. I had also underestimated the role of nationalist sentiments and historical narratives in shaping Russia's foreign policy. I had to revisit my assumptions about Russia's intentions and capabilities, and the implications for regional stability.</p>

   <h2>Three Lessons Learned</h2>
   <p>What do these cases teach us about geopolitical forecasting? Here are three lessons that I have gleaned from my experience:</p>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>Causality is complex and multi-factorial:</strong> geopolitical events usually result from a confluence of multiple causes, some of which are more visible and predictable than others. Identifying the right mix of factors requires a deep knowledge of history, culture, geography, and politics, as well as an ability to connect the dots and see the big picture.</li>
    <li><strong>Context matters more than data:</strong> collecting and analyzing data is important, but it is not enough to make accurate predictions. One needs to interpret the data in light of the broader context, including the actors, interests, norms, and constraints that shape the behavior of nations and societies. This requires a nuanced and holistic approach to forecasting, one that integrates qualitative and quantitative methods, as well as expert judgment and creativity.</li>
    <li><strong>Humility and flexibility are key:</strong> even the best forecasters can be wrong, and even the worst can be right. The future is inherently uncertain and volatile, and no one can predict it with 100% accuracy. Therefore, it is crucial to remain humble about our knowledge and assumptions, and to be open to alternative scenarios and surprises. This means constantly updating and refining our models and methods, and learning from our successes and failures alike.</li>
   </ol>

   <h2>The Road Ahead</h2>
   <p>As I look to the future of geopolitical forecasting, I see both challenges and opportunities. On the one hand, the world is becoming more complex, interconnected, and unpredictable, with new actors, technologies, and issues shaping the global landscape. On the other hand, the tools and techniques of forecasting are also improving, with advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data analytics enhancing our capacity to extract insights and reduce bias.</p>
   <p>However, the ultimate success of forecasting depends not only on the quality of our methods and models, but also on the quality of our human judgment and decision-making. Forecasting is not an end in itself, but a means to inform and improve our actions and policies. Therefore, it is crucial that we bridge the gap between forecasting and policy-making, and that we cultivate a culture of evidence-based and adaptive governance at all levels of society.</p>
