  <h2>An Interesting Story:</h2>
  <p>In 2014, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited India. The two countries signed several agreements, including a $20 billion deal for China to build two power plants in India. The visit was hailed as a breakthrough in Indo-China relations and was seen as a sign of growing economic and strategic ties between the two countries.</p>
  <p>However, just a few months later, in 2015, tensions between the two countries escalated when China blocked India's membership bid to the Nuclear Suppliers Group. This was seen as a betrayal by India, which had expected China to support its bid.</p>
  <h2>Examples and Case Studies:</h2>
  <p>Since then, India has adopted a more nuanced approach towards China under the leadership of S. Jaishankar. While Jaishankar was initially optimistic about the potential for cooperation between the two countries, he soon realized that China's actions were driven more by strategic interests than by any desire to build a genuine partnership with India.</p>
  <p>One example of this was India's decision to boycott China's Belt and Road Initiative, which it saw as a strategic move by China to gain influence in the region. India also stepped up its military presence in the Himalayan region, where it shares a border with China, in response to Chinese incursions.</p>
  <p>Another example was India's decision to ban several Chinese apps, including TikTok, citing national security concerns. This move was seen as a response to China's growing influence in India's tech sector.</p>
  <p>Despite these tensions, India has also tried to engage with China on issues of mutual concern, such as climate change and regional security. In 2019, the two countries held their first joint military exercise, and in 2020, they engaged in talks aimed at resolving their border dispute.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
  <p>India's nuanced approach towards China under S. Jaishankar reflects a recognition that China's actions are driven by strategic interests and that India needs to be mindful of its own strategic interests in the region. While India has sought to engage with China on issues of mutual concern, it has also taken a firm stance on issues where it sees its own interests at stake.</p>
  <p>Overall, India's approach towards China is likely to continue to evolve under Jaishankar's leadership, as India seeks to balance its economic and strategic interests with the need to maintain a stable and peaceful relationship with China.</p>
