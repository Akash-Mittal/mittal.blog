   <p>It's day 3 of the World Test Championship (WTC) Final and Australia are already in a commanding position. After winning the toss on day 1, Indian skipper Rohit Sharma chose to bowl but his decision didn't pay off as Australia scored 332 runs in the first innings. India could only manage 217 runs in response. And now, in the second innings, Australia have a lead of 296 runs with 6 wickets in hand.</p>
   <p>This is not the first time that India has struggled in Test cricket. In fact, India's away record in Test cricket has never been impressive. They have lost more Test series than they have won outside of Asia. The reasons for this are many, including the lack of quality pacers, inability to adapt to overseas conditions and a lack of preparation.</p>
   <h2>Lack of Quality Pacers</h2>
   <p>One of the biggest issues that India faces in Test cricket is the lack of quality pacers. In the past, India relied heavily on their spinners to win matches at home, but the same strategy doesn't work overseas. India's pace attack has always been a concern, especially when playing in countries like Australia, South Africa and England where the pitches offer more bounce and swing. In contrast, Australia has always been known for their formidable pace attack, which makes it difficult for the opposition batsmen to score runs.</p>
   <p>For example, in the ongoing WTC Final, India's pace bowlers have struggled to make an impact. In the first innings, they managed to take only 3 wickets, whereas Australia's pacers picked up 9 wickets. This clearly shows the difference in the quality of the two teams' pace attacks.</p>
   <h2>Inability to Adapt to Overseas Conditions</h2>
   <p>Another issue that India faces in Test cricket is the inability to adapt to overseas conditions. In home conditions, India is a dominant force, but the same cannot be said about their performances overseas. Indian teams have always struggled to adapt to the conditions in countries like Australia, South Africa and England where the pitches offer more swing and bounce. The Indian batsmen have often been found wanting against good quality pace bowling on these pitches.</p>
   <p>For instance, in the last tour of Australia in 2018-19, India's batting lineup was swept aside by the Australian pace attack. They were bowled out for scores of 250 or less in 6 of their 8 innings. This clearly shows that the Indian batsmen struggled to bat on the bouncy pitches in Australia.</p>
   <h2>Lack of Preparation</h2>
   <p>Another reason why India struggles in Test cricket is the lack of preparation. Unlike other countries, India doesn't have a proper system of preparing their players for overseas tours. The Indian team often arrives in a foreign country a few days before the first Test and doesn't get enough time to acclimatize to the conditions and get used to the pitches.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, countries like Australia and England have a proper system of preparing their players for overseas tours. They often send their teams to those countries well in advance to get used to the conditions and get match practice against the local teams. This gives their players enough time to adapt to the conditions and prepare themselves for the challenges ahead.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>India's struggles in Test cricket are not new. The team has always found it difficult to win matches outside of Asia. Despite having some of the world's best batsmen, India has never been able to dominate Test cricket like they do in limited-overs formats. The reasons for this are many, including the lack of quality pacers, inability to adapt to overseas conditions and a lack of preparation. If India wants to be a dominant force in Test cricket, they need to address these issues and work on their weaknesses.</p>
