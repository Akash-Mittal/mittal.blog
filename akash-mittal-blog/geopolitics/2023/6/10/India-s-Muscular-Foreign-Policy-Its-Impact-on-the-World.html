    <h2>An Interesting Story: Modi's Speech at the United Nations</h2>
    <p>In September 2019, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the United Nations General Assembly for the second time. His speech was assertive, highlighting India's contribution to the world and calling out Pakistan for its support of terrorism. Modi's speech showcased India's new foreign policy, one that is muscular and confident on the global stage.</p>

    <h2>Examples and Case Studies</h2>
    <p>India's new foreign policy can be seen in its approach to its neighbors, particularly Pakistan and China. In 2019, India revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, a move that was celebrated by many Indians but criticized by Pakistan and China. India also conducted air strikes on a terrorist camp in Pakistan in response to a terrorist attack on Indian soldiers.</p>
    <p>India's foreign policy has also been visible in its relationship with the United States. Modi has developed a strong personal relationship with President Donald Trump and has worked to strengthen India's ties with the US. India has also become more assertive in its relations with China, with both countries engaging in border standoffs in 2020.</p>
    <p>India has also taken a more active role in international organizations and initiatives. In 2016, India launched the International Solar Alliance, a group of countries working to promote solar energy. India has also sought to play a larger role in the United Nations, with Modi calling for India to be given a permanent seat on the UN Security Council.</p>
