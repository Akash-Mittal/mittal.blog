  <p>Education is one of the most important tools that a country can use to empower its people. From improving employability to imparting valuable life skills, education can pave the way for a brighter future. However, not all schools succeed in their quest to educate their students. One such example is the Pakistan High Commission School in India, which recently shut down due to low enrollment levels.</p>
  <h2>Case Study 1: Low Enrollment Levels</h2>
  <p>According to reports, the Pakistan High Commission School in India was shut down due to low enrollment levels. Despite being funded by the Government of Pakistan, the school struggled to attract students, resulting in its closure. This is a common issue that many schools face, especially in underprivileged areas where parents cannot afford to send their children to school.</p>
  <h3>Case Study 2: Lack of Infrastructure</h3>
  <p>Another common issue that schools face is the lack of infrastructure. Without proper facilities, students will struggle to learn and may not perform well in their exams. This was the case in the Pakistan High Commission School. Despite having dedicated teachers, the school lacked basic facilities such as computers and libraries, which made it difficult for students to keep up with their studies.</p>
  <h4>Case Study 3: Political Tensions</h4>
  <p>Finally, political tensions between Pakistan and India may have affected the functioning of the school. In recent years, tensions between the two countries have been high, which may have made it difficult for Pakistani students to attend school in India. This could have resulted in low enrollment levels, which ultimately led to the closure of the school.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>There are many factors that can contribute to the success or failure of a school. While a lack of funding can sometimes be a problem, other issues such as low enrollment levels and a lack of infrastructure can also contribute. In the case of the Pakistan High Commission School, a combination of factors led to its closure. However, it is important to remember that education is key to empowering individuals and societies.</p>
