  <h1>The Untold Potential of Kazakhstan and its Diplomatic Relations with EU and China</h1></br> <img src="images/The-Untold-Potential-of-Kazakhstan-and-its-Diplomatic-Relations-with-EU-and-China.jpeg" alt="+The-Untold-Potential-of-Kazakhstan-and-its-Diplomatic-Relations-with-EU-and-China+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/central-asia/news/western-pundits-offer-advice-on-kazakh-geopolitics/" target="_blank" href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/central-asia/news/western-pundits-offer-advice-on-kazakh-geopolitics/" rel="noopener">https://www.euractiv.com/section/central-asia/news/western-pundits-offer-advice-on-kazakh-geopolitics/</a></span></h5>
  <p>Imagine a vast country located in Central Asia with natural resources and a strategic location that acts as a bridge between Europe and Asia. It has a thriving economy and ambitious projects aimed at enhancing its infrastructure and developing its tourism industry. Such a country exists, and it is Kazakhstan.</p>
  <p>However, this former Soviet Republic has been relatively unknown to the West, and its geopolitical importance has often been overlooked. Nevertheless, recent developments have caught the attention of foreign diplomats, who have recognized the untapped potential that exists between Kazakhstan and the EU.</p>
  <h2>The Cooperation Potential Between Kazakhstan and the EU</h2>
  <p>According to former diplomats, Kazakhstan is an essential partner for the EU. The country is located in a geopolitical hotspot that is often overlooked by Western countries, and its economy is growing rapidly. The EU has acknowledged the potential that exists between the two parties and has recently signed a new agreement that will strengthen their cooperation even further.</p>
  <p>The agreement aims to enhance dialogue between the EU and Kazakhstan and improve cooperation in areas such as energy, trade, and environment. It also seeks to promote human rights, rule of law, and democratic principles. The EU recognizes the value of Kazakhstan's location and sees the country as a gateway to Central Asia.</p>
  <p>Kazakhstan's diplomatic relations with the EU have been vital to its development and international standing. For example, the EU has provided training to Kazakh judges and has also helped the country to adopt European environmental standards. Furthermore, the EU has helped Kazakhstan to develop its tourism industry, which is an area of strategic importance for the country.</p>
  <h2>The Risks of Being Overtaken by China</h2>
  <p>While Kazakhstan's diplomatic relations with the EU are promising, there is a risk that the country could be overtaken by China. China is a much more assertive geopolitical player and has been investing heavily in Kazakhstan's infrastructure projects. The Chinese are particularly interested in Kazakhstan's natural resources, and their investments have sometimes been criticized for their environmental impact.</p>
  <p>China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a vast infrastructure project that aims to connect Asia and Europe through a network of railways, highways, and ports. The BRI has been criticized by some Western countries, who see it as a way for China to expand its influence. However, Kazakhstan has embraced the project, seeing it as an opportunity to boost its international standing and attract foreign investment.</p>
  <p>The risk for the EU is that it could be left behind if it fails to invest in Kazakhstan's infrastructure projects. China has much deeper pockets than the EU and is willing to provide financial incentives that the EU cannot match. Nevertheless, the EU has recognized the risk and has made strategic investments in Kazakhstan's infrastructure to ensure that it remains a key player in the country's development.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Kazakhstan has enormous potential, and its diplomatic relations with both the EU and China are vital to its development. The EU recognizes the strategic importance of Kazakhstan and has invested heavily in the country's development. However, the risk of being overtaken by China is real, and the EU must continue to provide support to ensure that it remains a key player in Kazakh geopolitics.</p>
  <p>Kazakhstan's location, natural resources, and ambitious projects make it an important player in Central Asia. Western countries must recognize its potential and provide the necessary support to ensure that it remains a stable and prosperous country for years to come.</p>
