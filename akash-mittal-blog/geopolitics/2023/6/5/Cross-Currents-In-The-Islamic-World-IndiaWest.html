  <h1>Cross Currents In The Islamic World</h1> <img src="images/Cross-Currents-In-The-Islamic-World-IndiaWest.jpeg" alt="+Cross-Currents-In-The-Islamic-World-IndiaWest+">
  <p>It was the summer of 2018 when the world witnessed a remarkable event. A 25-year-old Pakistani woman, Farzana Parveen, was stoned to death by her own family in broad daylight right outside a court-house in the city of Lahore. Farzana was pregnant and was being taken to the court by her husband to declare their love marriage. Her father, brothers, and other family members attacked the couple, and Farzana was killed. The reason: She had defied family traditions by marrying the man she loved. Her killers were subsequently released on bail.</p>
  <p>This incident sparked a worldwide debate on the treatment of women in Islam. Many Muslim spokespeople condemned the killing, but more than a few defended it as being in line with traditional Islamic values. The paradox of the Islamic faith is that it has a diversity of cultural norms under the banner of Islamic values. This article will explore some of the significant cross-currents within Islamic societies that have arisen in recent years.</p>
  <h2>The Rise of Political Islam</h2>
  <p>The 9/11 attacks on the United States accelerated the scrutiny of Islam, particularly Islam as a political force. In the Middle East and North Africa, elections held after the Arab Spring of 2011 brought Islamist politicians to power in several countries. People turned to Islam as a source of values in a time when their societies were undergoing rapid change. Critics, however, argue that Islamist leaders sought to impose strict interpretations of Islam onto secular societies. This conflict has led to the rise of violent extremist groups such as ISIS, which has wreaked havoc across this region.</p>
  <h3>Case Study: Egypt</h3>
  <p>Mohamed Morsi became Egypt's first Islamist president in 2012, following the revolution which ousted longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak. Morsi's year-long tenure, however, was marked by political turmoil and clashes with secular groups who saw his Muslim Brotherhood as seeking to impose a religious dictatorship. The army eventually overthrew Morsi in July 2013, to applause from protesters.</p>
  <h2>The Women's Rights Movement in the Islamic World</h2>
  <p>The status of women in Islam continues to be a complex issue that has captured global attention. There is considerable variation in women's rights within Islamic countries, with some making progress towards greater gender equality and others remaining highly patriarchal.</p>
  <h3>Case Study: Iran</h3>
  <p>The Islamic Revolution of 1979 brought Ayatollah Khomeini to power in Iran, leading to the establishment of an Islamic Republic. Since then, Iranian women have struggled for their rights, through protests and social media campaigns. Iranian women are required to cover themselves, follow strict codes of behavior, and are not allowed to attend sporting events in stadiums. However, they are still permitted to drive cars without male permission, unlike Saudi women. One of Iran's most famous human rights campaigners is Nasrin Sotoudeh, who has been imprisoned multiple times for her advocacy work.</p>
  <h2>The Sectarian Divide: Sunni vs. Shia</h2>
  <p>The division between Sunni and Shia Muslims is one of the most enduring conflicts in Islamic societies. Sunnis make up around 85% of the Islamic population, while Shia Muslims account for the remaining 15%. The differences between the two sects of Islam are historical, political, and theological. Recent conflicts between these groups have deepened intractable issues that have not always recognized the diversity of Islam's various sects.</p>
  <h3>Case Study: Iraq</h3>
  <p>Iraq's population is majority Shia but was ruled by a Sunni minority under former president Saddam Hussein. After the United States led a coalition to remove him from power in 2003, Shia Muslims rose to prominence in post-Saddam Iraq's parliamentary government. This shift rattled the many Sunni Muslims who felt their power diminish. This marginalization, as well as a weak government's inability to control ethnic and sectarian tensions, eventually led to the emergence of the Islamic State, a Sunni extremist group that conquered large swaths of Iraqi territory before being driven out by Iraq's army and political factions, with international assistance.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The Islamic world is a complex, diverse and dynamic place, with a range of cultural, political, theological, and historical influences that have shaped its development over the years. Although there are certainly deep-seated conflicts within certain areas and among certain groups, it is also important to remember that there are also many peaceful and inclusive traditions within Islam. The key to creating a more equitable future for Muslims is to embrace these traditions and continue to work for greater justice, peace, and prosperity for all.</p>
