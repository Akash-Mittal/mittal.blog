  <h1>Ambitious Roadmap: India-US Agree to Deepen Defence Ties to Counter China</h1> <img src="images/Ambitious-Roadmap-India-US-Agree-to-Deepen-Defence-Ties-to-Counter-China.jpeg" alt="+Ambitious-Roadmap-India-US-Agree-to-Deepen-Defence-Ties-to-Counter-China+">
  <p>On 26th October 2020, India and the United States signed a landmark defence pact, the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) during the Ministerial Two-Plus-Two Dialogue held in New Delhi. The accord paves the way for the two countries to deepen their defence ties and effectively counter the aggressive actions of China in the Indo-Pacific region. This latest move is part of the ambitious roadmap that was laid out by the two countries in 2018, in which they agreed to strengthen their partnership in several key areas, including defence, trade, and energy.</p>
  <h2>The Growing Threat of China</h2>
  <p>China's rising power and influence pose a significant threat to the world's democratic countries. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has been pursuing an expansionist policy in the Indo-Pacific region, claiming sovereignty over a large part of the South China Sea and even creating new islands to assert its dominance. Beijing has also been using its economic clout to coerce other countries into obeying its demands, and its human rights abuses are well documented.</p>
  <p>The Indian government has been increasingly concerned about China's activities along its borders as well as its growing involvement in Nepal, Sri Lanka, and other neighbouring countries. In June 2020, the Chinese army started an aggressive move by establishing itself along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Galwan Valley, marking the first deadly clash between the two armies in more than 40 years. The incident has further deteriorated the relations between the two nations, with India adopting a more assertive stance to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>
  <h2>Deepening Defence Ties</h2>
  <p>The defence partnership between India and the United States has been steadily growing over the past decade. In 2005, the two countries signed a Defence Framework Agreement, which paved the way for joint military exercises, defence trade, and co-production of defence equipment. Since then, the two countries have signed several other agreements, including the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) in 2016 and the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) in 2018.</p>
  <p>The BECA, the latest addition to this list, is a geospatial intelligence-sharing pact. Under the agreement, the US will share advanced satellite and other real-time data with India to help improve its defence capabilities and enhance its situational awareness. This information will be useful for India in enhancing its surveillance capabilities of its borders with Pakistan and China.</p>
  <p>The BECA will also enable India to access topographical and aeronautical data, which is useful for mapping and targetting. This data will be instrumental in India's precision strike capabilities, improving its offensive and defensive positions, and enhancing its situational awareness. The agreement will further accelerate the operationalisation of Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) into the Indian defense apparatus, with secure and encrypted real-time data available for joint military exercises and other operations.</p>
  <h3>Case Studies</h3>
  <h4>Joint Military Exercises</h4>
  <p>India and the US have been conducting joint military exercises since 2004, which has helped improve interoperability and build trust between the two militaries. Their joint exercises have included exercises on maritime security, HADR (Humanitarian Aid and Disaster Relief), special forces training, and air combat exercises. The Indo-US Malabar exercise, the largest naval exercise in the region, is an example of the deepening India-US defence cooperation. The US has also provided advanced defence equipment such as the C-17 Globemaster III and the P-8 Poseidon aircraft, which has given India an edge over its rivals.</p>
  <h4>Counter-terrorism Cooperation</h4>
  <p>The United States has been providing India with intelligence and operational support in counter-terrorism efforts. This cooperation has helped India strengthen its counter-terrorism framework, intelligence sharing, and technical collaborations. For example, in the aftermath of the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks, the US provided critical information to Indian agencies to apprehend the perpetrators. The US has also been helping India develop its maritime domain awareness capability and its counter-piracy efforts.</p>
  <h4>Defence Trade</h4>
  <p>The India-US defence trade has been steadily growing over the years. The total value of defence trade between the two countries was around $20 billion in 2020. The US has emerged as the second-largest supplier of defence equipment to India after Russia. The US has been providing India with advanced defence equipment such as helicopters, transport planes, artillery guns, and anti-submarine warfare systems. India has also been eyeing the US-made F-35 fighter jets as part of its modernisation programme.</p>
  <h2>The Way Forward</h2>
  <p>India-US defence cooperation is poised to grow further in the coming years, with the two countries planning to expand their collaboration in several areas. The two countries have identified emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), unmanned systems, and space exploration as the key areas for cooperation. The US has also been engaging India in its 'Indo-Pacific' strategy to counter the growing influence of China in the region. The strengthening of defence ties between the two countries is essential for regional peace, stability, and prosperity.</p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>The BECA agreement marks another milestone in India-US defence cooperation, deepening their strategic partnership in the Indo-Pacific region. It is a significant step towards building a closer military partnership and enhancing cooperation in emerging technologies, such as AI, space exploration, and unmanned systems. The agreement will help build a cohesive and collaborative defence ecosystem, improve the defence capabilities of both countries, and counter the growing threat of China. India-US defence cooperation is expected to have significant benefits for regional peace, security, and prosperity and will help shape the future of the Indo-Pacific.</p>
