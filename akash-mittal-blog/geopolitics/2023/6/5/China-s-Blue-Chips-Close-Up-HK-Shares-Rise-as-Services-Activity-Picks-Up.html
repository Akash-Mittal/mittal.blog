    <h2>Interesting Story</h2>
    <p>China's economy has been undergoing a major transformation in recent years, shifting from being predominantly manufacturing-based to one that is increasingly driven by the services sector. This transition has been difficult, but it appears to be paying off as services activity picks up and HK shares rise.</p>
    <p>One interesting case study is China's largest commercial property developer, Dalian Wanda Group. The company has been moving away from its traditional real estate business and investing heavily in the services sector, including cinemas, sports, tourism, and e-commerce.</p>
    <p>Another example is Tencent Holdings, a Chinese multinational conglomerate that specializes in various internet-related services and products, including social media, online advertising, and gaming. The company has been expanding rapidly in recent years, particularly in the mobile sector, and has been named as one of the world's most valuable brands.</p>
    <h2>Services Activity Picks Up</h2>
    <p>According to a recent survey by Caixin/Markit, China's services sector expanded at its fastest pace in four months in September, with the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rising to 53.1 from 52.7 in August. This indicates that services activity is picking up, which is a positive sign for the overall health of China's economy.</p>
    <p>The Caixin/Markit survey also showed that businesses in the services sector are becoming more confident, with optimism about future growth hitting a six-month high in September.</p>
    <h2>HK Shares Rise</h2>
    <p>As services activity picks up in China, HK shares are on the rise. The Hang Seng Index climbed 0.6% to close at 24,636.28 on October 13, 2021, marking its highest close since September 24. This was largely due to gains in Chinese blue-chip stocks.</p>
    <p>One reason for this is that investors are betting that China's economy is on the road to recovery, with the services sector playing a key role. Another factor is the improving global demand for Chinese goods, which is boosting exports and fueling growth.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>China's economy is undergoing a major transformation as it moves from being primarily manufacturing-based to one that is more focused on services. This change is challenging, but it appears to be paying off as services activity picks up and HK shares rise. The examples of Dalian Wanda Group and Tencent Holdings demonstrate the potential for success in the services sector, and the recent survey by Caixin/Markit indicates that businesses in this industry are becoming more confident. As services continue to play a larger role in China's economy, we can expect HK shares to continue rising.</p>
