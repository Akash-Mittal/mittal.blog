   <p>Imagine scrolling through your Facebook feed and being bombarded with posts glorifying drug smuggling and promoting extremist ideologies. This is the reality for many in Pakistan. The country has been using social media to radicalise its citizens, mainly targeting the youth.</p>
   <h2>Narcotics Smuggling and Social Media</h2>
   <p>Narcotics smuggling is a major issue in Pakistan. One way the country has been using social media is to glamorize this illegal activity. They do this through posts promoting the "lifestyle" of drug traffickers, featuring luxurious cars and stacks of cash. This kind of content can be attractive to young people looking for a way to escape poverty and make quick money. In addition, it normalizes the idea that breaking the law is okay if it leads to wealth and success, which can have dangerous consequences.</p>
   <h3>Case study: Nasir Janjua</h3>
   <p>Nasir Janjua, a drug trafficker, was arrested in Pakistan in 2016. He had a massive social media following, with over 200,000 likes on his Facebook page. His social media posts were filled with images of him posing with stacks of cash, luxury cars, and fancy watches. He used his influence to attract other young people into the drug trade, convincing them that this was the only way they could improve their lives. The police used his social media as evidence against him in court.</p>
   <h2>Local Influencers</h2>
   <p>In addition to individual drug traffickers, Pakistan has been using local influencers to spread their radical ideologies. These influencers have large followings and can sway public opinion on issues like politics and religion. They often focus on portraying extremist groups like the Taliban in a positive light. This normalization of extremist ideologies can lead to an increase in support for these groups and ultimately, their acts of violence.</p>
   <h3>Case study: Junaid Jamshed</h3>
   <p>Junaid Jamshed was a popular Pakistani musician turned Islamic preacher. He had a significant social media following with over two million followers on Facebook alone. In his sermons, he often expressed extremist views and praised groups like the Taliban. He had a significant impact on many young people in Pakistan, who looked up to him as a role model. Sadly, in 2016, Jamshed died in a plane crash, but his online presence still influences the youth of Pakistan.</p>
   <h2>Rapid Radicalisation</h2>
   <p>Social media has made it easier for Pakistan to radicalize the youth. Young people are often more vulnerable to being lured into extremist ideologies as they search for a sense of belonging and purpose. While some might argue that social media is just a platform, the reality is that it has allowed Pakistan to rapidly spread their radical ideas to a large number of people. When these young people become radicalized, they can become a danger to society, committing acts of terrorism, and further spreading extremist ideas to others.</p>
