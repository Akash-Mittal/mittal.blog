  <p>David Warner, one of the greatest Australian openers in the history of cricket, is all set to play his final Test match against Pakistan at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). Warner's career has been nothing short of a roller coaster ride, filled with highs and lows, but he has overcome them with resilience and hard work.</p>
  <p>Warner has been an integral part of the Australian cricket team for over a decade, and his achievements speak for themselves. He has scored over 7,000 runs in Test cricket at an impressive average of 48.2, with 24 centuries to his name. Warner's attacking style of play has always been a treat to watch, and his contributions to the team have been immense.</p>
  <p>However, Warner has had his fair share of controversies. The infamous ball-tampering scandal in Cape Town in 2018 saw him suspended from cricket for a year. But, he has made a glorious comeback to the game, and has been performing exceptionally well since his return.</p>
  <p>Warner's swansong Test at the SCG is expected to be an emotional affair for both him and the fans. He will be looking to make his last Test match a memorable one, and there are a few things that he will be hoping for.</p>

  <p>Warner will also be looking to end his career on a high note. He has been in terrific form lately, scoring back-to-back centuries in the ongoing series against Pakistan. He will be hoping to continue that form in his final Test match, and help Australia secure a series win.</p>
  <h2>A Test win for Australia</h2>
  <p>Warner will be hoping for a Test win for Australia, which would be a fitting end to his illustrious career. The Australian team has been in good form lately, and they will be looking to continue that in the final Test match against Pakistan.</p>
  <p>Australia has won all the previous Tests against Pakistan, and Warner will be hoping to make it a clean sweep. He will be eager to contribute with the bat, and help his team secure a win in his final Test match.</p>
  <h2>Making an impact off the field</h2>
  <p>Warner has always been a team player, and he will be looking to make an impact off the field as well. He has been involved in numerous charitable activities and has always been a role model for young cricketers.</p>
  <p>Warner will be hoping to leave a lasting legacy, and inspire the next generation of cricketers. He will be looking to make a positive impact in whatever he does, both on and off the field.</p>
