    <p>In his prime, Virender Sehwag was one of the most devastating openers in the world of cricket. He was equally feared in all three formats of the game, and his exploits with the bat earned him a legion of fans. But, when it comes to picking the biggest middle order batsman, Sehwag has gone against the grain and picked a former Pakistan captain whose statistics don't quite match up to some of his contemporaries.</p>
    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>The former Pakistan captain in question is Inzamam-ul-Haq, who played 378 ODIs and scored 11739 runs at an average of 39.52. He also played 120 Tests, scoring 8830 runs at an average of 49.60. While his statistics are impressive, they don't rank among the all-time greats. However, Sehwag believes that Inzamam's impact on the game was much greater than the numbers suggest.</p>
    <p>Sehwag cited Inzamam's ability to absorb pressure and play match-winning innings as the reasons why he rated him higher than his contemporaries. In the 1992 World Cup, Inzamam announced himself to the world with a match-winning knock against New Zealand in the semi-finals. He followed that up with another crucial innings in the final against England, which Pakistan won by 22 runs. Inzamam's performances in that tournament laid the foundation for a great career, and he went on to become one of the best middle order batsmen of his generation.</p>
    <p>Another example that Sehwag gave was Inzamam's innings in the famous Kolkata Test of 2005. Pakistan were down 2-0 in the series, and needed to win the match to stay alive. Inzamam came out to bat at number five with his team in trouble at 39/2. He played a gritty innings of 184*, which helped Pakistan post a total of 393. India were bowled out for 233 in their second innings, which gave Pakistan a memorable victory.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, Virender Sehwag's choice of Inzamam-ul-Haq as the biggest middle order batsman may surprise many cricket fans, but it is a testament to the impact that Inzamam had on the game. While his numbers don't quite match up to his contemporaries, his ability to play match-winning innings and absorb pressure was second to none. Inzamam was a true stalwart of Pakistani cricket, and his legacy will live on for generations to come.</p>
