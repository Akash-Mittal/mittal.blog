    <p>Once upon a time, there were five emerging economies that decided to join forces and create a bloc in order to enhance their global influence and economic growth. They called themselves BRICS, an acronym for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.</p>
    <p>At first, the alliance seemed unstoppable. They were home to over 40% of the world's population and represented almost a quarter of the world's GDP. Their trade increased significantly and they made important deals with other countries and organizations such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization.</p>
    <p>However, as time went by, new political challenges and tensions arose, putting at risk their once strong union and their economic exchange. In this article, we will explore how geopolitics could affect BRICS countries' commerce and the consequences it could bring.</p>

    <h2>Examples with Case Studies</h2>
    <p>One of the biggest challenges that BRICS face is their diverse political and economic agendas. China, for instance, has a different approach to commerce than India. Additionally, many of these countries have important trade partners that could influence their political stances.</p>
    <p>Let's take China as an example. Their Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a massive infrastructure project that seeks to connect China with Europe and Africa through a network of trade routes. Although this project could bring important benefits to the countries involved, it raises concerns about China's political influence and economic power.</p>
    <p>Another example is the import tariffs that the United States has been imposing on Chinese products, which has resulted in a trade war between the two countries. This situation could have a significant impact on the other BRICS countries as well, especially if they have strong ties with both China and the US.</p>
    <p>Moreover, political instability in some of these countries could also affect their commerce. For instance, Brazil has been facing political turmoil for years, which has resulted in a decrease in foreign investment and a weakened economy. This could have an impact on their commerce with other BRICS countries as well.</p>
    <p>All of these examples show that geopolitics plays a crucial role in commerce and that BRICS countries need to find a way to balance their political interests with their economic growth.</p>
