    <p>US Defense Secretary's perspective on upgrading India-US Ties to counter China and its impact on Global Politics.</p>

     <h4>Introduction</h4>
     <p>As the world is preparing for the post-pandemic era, the strategic significance of Indo-Pacific region has increased manyfold. Among the countries in this region, India has emerged as a strategic partner for the US in recent years. The changing equations of global politics have put India and the US on the same page and one of the key reason for this alignment is China's overt aggression in the region. In this article, we will explore the perspective of US Defense Secretary on upgrading India-US ties to counter China and its impact on global politics.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col">
     <h4>A Historical Perspective</h4>
     <p>The Indo-US relationship started with the signing of a strategic partnership agreement in 2004 under the leadership of then US President George W Bush and then Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Since then, the relationship has seen many ups and downs but it has grown stronger over time. In the last few years, the Indo-US defense relationship has made significant progress with the signing of key agreements like LEMOA (Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement), COMCASA (Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement), and BECA (Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement for Geo-Spatial Cooperation). These agreements have enabled the militaries of both countries to work closely together and enhance their interoperability.</p>

     <h2>Upgrading India-US Ties to Counter China</h2>
     <p>US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, during his visit to India in March 2021, emphasized the importance of upgrading and strengthening the India-US partnership to counter the growing threat posed by China. India shares a 3,488-kilometer border with China, and the ongoing border tensions between the two countries have further fuelled their rivalry. Austin was quoted saying, "As we look ahead, I look forward to discussing opportunities to elevate the US-India Major Defense Partnership, and we'll discuss regional security challenges, including China."</p>
     <p>Many experts believe that the US is pursuing this alliance with India not only to counter China but also to maintain its own global supremacy. The Indo-US alliance has the potential to balance China's increasing influence in the region, but it also has the potential to create a new power bloc. The rise of this power bloc will have a significant impact on the nature of the global order, and it is yet to be seen how other countries will react to this shift in balance of power.</p>

     <h2>Impact on Global Politics</h2>
     <p>The upgrading of India-US ties to counter China has the potential to significantly impact global politics. The US has been promoting its Indo-Pacific strategy to counter China's expansionism in the region, and India has become a key player in this strategy. The strengthening of the Indo-US alliance will not only act as a deterrent to China's territorial expansionism but also provide a counter-narrative to China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which is aimed at increasing China's influence in the region.</p>
     <p>Another significant impact of this alliance will be on the Quad. The Quad, short for Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, is an informal strategic forum comprising the US, India, Japan, and Australia. The Quad has been seen as a counter to China's expansionist policies and has been gaining traction recently. The upgrading of the India-US partnership will give a further boost to the Quad, and it is likely that the Quad will emerge as a significant force to reckon with in the region.</p>

     <h2>Conclusion</h2>
     <p>The upgrading of India-US ties to counter China is a strategic move aimed at balancing China's growing influence in the region. This alliance has the potential to significantly impact global politics and the nature of the global order. It remains to be seen how China will react to this alliance, and how other countries will navigate the new balance of power. The US and India must carefully manage this alliance to ensure that it does not lead to unintended consequences.</p>
     <p>In conclusion, the Indo-US partnership is a significant development in the changing equations of global politics. It has the potential to create a new power bloc in the region and provide a counter-narrative to China's expansionism. The success of this partnership will depend on how effectively the US and India can work together to manage their differences and achieve their strategic goals.</p>
