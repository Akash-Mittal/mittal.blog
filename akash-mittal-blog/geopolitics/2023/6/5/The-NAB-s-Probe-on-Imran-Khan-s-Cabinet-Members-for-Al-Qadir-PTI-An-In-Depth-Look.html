  <h1>The NAB's Probe on Imran Khan's Cabinet Members for Al Qadir PTI - An In-Depth Look</h1> <img src="images/The-NAB-s-Probe-on-Imran-Khan-s-Cabinet-Members-for-Al-Qadir-PTI-An-In-Depth-Look.jpeg" alt="+The-NAB-s-Probe-on-Imran-Khan-s-Cabinet-Members-for-Al-Qadir-PTI-An-In-Depth-Look+">
  <p>Corruption is a term that has become synonymous with politics in the current era. Every day, we hear stories of public money being misused, government officials embezzling funds, and politicians taking bribes. One such story is of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) probing the former Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan's 22 cabinet members in Al Qadir PTI. This is a grave matter that calls for an in-depth look.</p>
  <h2>What is NAB?</h2>
  <p>NAB is an autonomous body that is responsible for the investigation and prosecution of corruption cases in Pakistan. It was established in 1999 with the mission to eliminate corruption and promote transparency in all spheres of public life. It has powers to investigate and prosecute cases against public officials, politicians, and private individuals who are involved in corrupt practices.</p>
  <h2>Imran Khan and Al Qadir PTI</h2>
  <p>Imran Khan, the former Prime Minister of Pakistan, is known for his anti-corruption stance. Before coming to power, he promised to eradicate corruption from all levels of the government. He formed the political party, Al Qadir PTI, with the same motto and won the general elections in 2018. However, his cabinet members' alleged involvement in corrupt practices contradicts his claim of a corruption-free government.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies of Alleged Corruption</h2>
  <h3>Aleem Khan, Minister for Local Government and Community Development</h3>
  <p>The NAB arrested Aleem Khan on charges of possessing assets beyond his known sources of income. He was alleged to have 35 properties worth millions of dollars in Pakistan and Dubai. The investigations revealed that he couldn't explain the sources of these assets; thus, NAB filed a reference against him.</p>
  <h3>Azam Swati, Federal Minister for Science and Technology</h3>
  <p>Azam Swati was accused of misusing his authority by getting a bogus case registered against a family that angered him. The case involved the demolition of Swati's farmhouse's boundary wall by the family. Swati used his ministerial powers to get the Islamabad police to book the family in a fake case. The case drew public outrage, and Swati was heavily criticized.</p>
  <h3>Abdul Hafeez Sheikh, Advisor to the Prime Minister for Finance and Revenue</h3>
  <p>The NAB arrested Abdul Hafeez Sheikh on charges of corruption in the wheat and sugar crisis probe. The investigations revealed that he had misused his authority by illegally allowing sugar mills to export sugar. The export of sugar caused a shortage in the domestic market, and the prices skyrocketed, affecting the public adversely.</p>
