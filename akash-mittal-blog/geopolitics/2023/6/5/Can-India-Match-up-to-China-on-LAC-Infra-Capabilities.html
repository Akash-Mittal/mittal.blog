  <h1>Can India Match up to China on LAC Infra Capabilities?</h1> <img src="images/Can-India-Match-up-to-China-on-LAC-Infra-Capabilities.jpeg" alt="+Can-India-Match-up-to-China-on-LAC-Infra-Capabilities+">
  <p>On June 15th, 2020, the world watched in disbelief as the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) ambushed and brutally killed 20 Indian soldiers at Galwan Valley along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The incident reiterated the fact that India was lagging behind China in terms of infrastructure capabilities along the LAC. But can India catch up to China in this race?</p>
  <h2>Examples of India Closing the Gap</h2>
  <p>Despite the setback at Galwan Valley, India has been making progress in improving its infrastructure capabilities along the LAC. One such example is the construction of the Atal Tunnel, which was recently inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Atal Tunnel, located on the Rohtang Pass, is the longest highway tunnel in the world, and would provide all-weather access to Ladakh.</p>
  <p>Another example is the construction of a strategic road in Arunachal Pradesh, which connects Tawang with the rest of the country. The road, which was completed in 2019, is expected to enhance India's defence capabilities in the region.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies of Infra Development in India</h2>
  <h3>Border Roads Organisation (BRO)</h3>
  <p>One of the key agencies responsible for infrastructure development along the LAC is the Border Roads Organisation (BRO). The BRO, which comes under the Ministry of Defence, is responsible for the construction and maintenance of roads and infrastructure in India's border areas.</p>
  <p>BRO has been making steady progress towards improving India's infrastructure capabilities along the LAC. In the last few years, BRO has completed the construction of several strategic roads, bridges and tunnels in the region. For instance, the BRO recently completed the construction of a 19-km-long all-weather road in Sikkim, which connects the army bases at Nathu La and Sherathang with Gangtok.</p>
  <h3>Kashmir's Infrastructure Push</h3>
  <p>The government of Jammu and Kashmir has also been making efforts to improve the infrastructure capabilities of the region. In 2019, the Centre approved the construction of a 14.2-km-long Zojila tunnel, which would connect the Ladakh region with the rest of the country. The tunnel, which would be India's longest bi-directional tunnel, would provide all-weather access to the region, which is currently cut off for six months every year due to heavy snowfall.</p>
  <p>The government of Jammu and Kashmir has also been working on upgrading the Srinagar-Leh highway, which is crucial for the region's economic and strategic interests. Recently, the government announced that the entire stretch of the highway would be expanded to a four-lane road.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>India has been making steady progress towards improving its infrastructure capabilities along the LAC. The construction of the Atal Tunnel and the strategic road in Arunachal Pradesh are just a few examples of India's efforts in this direction. The Border Roads Organisation and the government of Jammu and Kashmir have also been actively working on improving the infrastructure in the region.</p>
  <p>However, there is still a long way to go before India can match up to China's infrastructure capabilities along the LAC. China has invested heavily in infrastructure development in the region, and has been working on several ambitious projects, such as the Belt and Road Initiative.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless, India's efforts towards enhancing its infrastructure capabilities along the LAC are a step in the right direction, and would go a long way in securing the country's borders and enhancing its strategic interests in the region.</p>
