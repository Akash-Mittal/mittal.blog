    <p>Apple is known for its high-end products and strong brand image that has been developed over the years. But, it wasn't always the case.</p>
    <p>In the early 2000s, when Apple was struggling to survive, it decided to enter the retail market by opening its first flagship store in Tyson's Corner, Virginia. This was a risky move considering the company had no experience in retail and many experts had doubts about the success of the venture.</p>
    <p>However, it turned out to be a game-changer. The Apple store soon became a destination for Apple fans and curious shoppers alike, with its sleek design, interactive displays, and knowledgeable staff.</p>
    <p>Fast forward to 2021, Apple now has more than 500 stores worldwide, but it is still expanding.</p>

    <h2>New Flagship Stores in India, China, and South Korea</h2>
    <p>The latest announcement from Apple is that it plans to open new flagship stores in India, China, and South Korea. These countries are strategic markets for Apple, and the company is looking to capitalize on their growing middle class and tech-savvy population.</p>
    <h3>Focus on India</h3>
    <p>India is a huge market for Apple, with a population of over 1.3 billion. However, due to various challenges, Apple has not been able to penetrate the Indian market as effectively as it would have liked. One of the main challenges has been the high import duties on its products.</p>
    <p>By opening new flagship stores in India, Apple hopes to overcome this challenge and establish a stronger presence in the country. The company has already announced plans to open its first Apple Store in Mumbai in 2022.</p>
    <p>This move aligns with Apple's recent efforts to increase its local manufacturing in India, which would help it to reduce costs and offer more competitively-priced products to Indian customers.</p>
    <h3>Focus on China</h3>
    <p>China is another important market for Apple. It is the world's largest smartphone market, and Apple has been able to establish a strong position in the premium smartphone segment. However, with intense competition from local players like Huawei and Xiaomi, Apple needs to stay ahead of the game.</p>
    <p>Opening new flagship stores in China will help Apple to maintain its brand image and offer a premium shopping experience to its customers. The company has already announced plans to build a new flagship store in Beijing's popular shopping district, Wangfujing. This store is expected to be one of Apple's largest in the world.</p>
    <p>In addition to opening new stores, Apple has also been investing heavily in research and development in China, with a focus on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and augmented reality.</p>
    <h3>Focus on South Korea</h3>
    <p>South Korea is a highly developed country with one of the highest smartphone adoption rates in the world. It is also the home of Samsung, Apple's biggest rival.</p>
    <p>Despite this, Apple has been able to establish a strong presence in the country, with a loyal customer base. By opening new flagship stores in South Korea, Apple hopes to strengthen its position in the country and attract new customers.</p>
    <p>The company has already opened its first store in South Korea in 2018, which has been a huge success. Apple is now planning to open a second store in the trendy Garosu-gil district in Seoul, which is famous for its high-end shopping and dining experiences.</p>
