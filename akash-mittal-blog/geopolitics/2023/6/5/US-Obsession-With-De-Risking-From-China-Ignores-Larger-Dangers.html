   <h2>An Opinion Piece</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>It was a typical afternoon when Jane decided to replace her old smartphone with a new one. She went online and searched for different options. After browsing for a while, she found an affordable phone from a Chinese manufacturer. The phone had good specs, and all the necessary features she was looking for.</p>
   <p>However, something caught her eye while checking the product details – the phone had banned apps pre-installed. Jane wasn't sure what that meant, but she still bought the phone as it had all the features she needed.</p>
   <p>Months later, Jane was shocked to know that her phone was sending data to a server located in China, without her knowledge or consent. She wasn't the only one; millions of users across the world have experienced similar issues. The US administration has warned about such risks and has been in the process of "de-risking" from Chinese tech products.</p>
   <h2>China vs the US</h2>
   <p>The US and China are two major global powers that are engaged in a never-ending trade war. The US blames China for several unfair trade practices, such as dumping products, stealing intellectual property, and forcing technology transfers from US companies doing business in China. The US is also wary of the Chinese government's influence on Chinese companies, which it believes poses a risk to national security. However, the obsession with de-risking from China is ignoring the larger dangers that could have far-reaching consequences.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <h3>Huawei and ZTE</h3>
   <p>Two of the most prominent Chinese companies that have faced the heat in recent times are Huawei and ZTE. The US believes that these companies pose a risk to national security as they could potentially be used by the Chinese government to spy on Americans. The US government has gone as far as to ban government employees from using Huawei and ZTE devices.</p>
   <p>However, the US obsession with de-risking from these companies could have a significant impact on the global telecommunications industry. Huawei and ZTE are major players in this space, and several countries, especially those without an established 5G infrastructure, are relying on these companies to provide the necessary equipment. If the US sanctions end up affecting these companies, it could lead to a delay in the rollout of 5G networks across the world.</p>
   <h3>TikTok</h3>
   <p>TikTok, the popular Chinese video-sharing app, is currently facing a ban in India and the US. India has banned several Chinese apps, including TikTok, citing national security concerns. The US has been considering a similar ban, arguing that TikTok is sending user data to China, which could potentially be used for espionage.</p>
   <p>However, TikTok's ban could lead to a significant loss for the app's creators and the broader entertainment industry. The app has over two billion downloads worldwide, with a significant user base in the US. Additionally, several content creators have built their careers and livelihoods on the platform.</p>
   <h2>The Larger Dangers</h2>
   <h3>Decoupling</h3>
   <p>The obsession with de-risking from China could potentially lead to a process of decoupling between the two countries. Several US companies are already exploring the feasibility of moving their manufacturing units to other countries, such as India and Vietnam. This could lead to a significant economic impact, as China is the world's second-largest economy. Additionally, the decoupling process could have far-reaching consequences, such as a potential arms race, an increase in the digital divide, and geopolitical instability.</p>
   <h3>Missed Opportunities</h3>
   <p>The obsession with de-risking from China could also lead to missed opportunities. China is home to several innovative companies that are leading the way in several sectors, including AI, e-commerce, and renewable energy. Several US companies have partnered with Chinese firms, and many have benefited from this partnership. Cutting off ties with China could lead to missed opportunities for US companies.</p>
   <h3>International Cooperation</h3>
   <p>The obsession with de-risking from China could also lead to a breakdown in international cooperation. Several countries in the world are looking towards China for infrastructure development, and the US has been trying to counter this by pushing its own initiatives, such as the Blue Dot Network. If the obsession with de-risking continues, it could lead to a breakdown of international cooperation, which could have far-reaching consequences.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The obsession with de-risking from China is understandable given the current geopolitical climate. However, it is important to acknowledge the larger dangers that come with this obsession. The US should focus on maintaining a balance between its national security concerns and the larger economic and geopolitical implications of de-risking from China. It is equally important to explore avenues for international cooperation and engagement, which could lead to a more stable and prosperous global order.</p>
