   <h1>Pakistan Anti-Graft Watchdog Expedites $190m Scam Probe Against 22 Ex Cabinet Members</h1> <img src="images/Pakistan-Anti-Graft-Watchdog-Expedites-190m-Scam-Probe-Against-22-Ex-Cabinet-Members.jpeg" alt="+Pakistan-Anti-Graft-Watchdog-Expedites-190m-Scam-Probe-Against-22-Ex-Cabinet-Members+">
   <p>Pakistan's anti-graft watchdog, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), has expedited a probe into a $190m scam allegedly involving 22 former members of the country's cabinet, according to reports.</p>

   <h2>The Allegations</h2>
   <p>The scam relates to the award of contracts for the import of liquified natural gas (LNG) between 2013 and 2018, when a number of the accused served in the federal cabinet. The NAB alleges that the contracts were awarded at exorbitant rates, causing losses to the national exchequer.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <p>The NAB has been investigating the case for several months, and has already arrested a number of those accused, including Abdul Aziz Sheikh, a former managing director of the Pakistan State Oil Company. Sheikh was charged with his alleged involvement in the scam in July 2019, and has since been in custody. Other high-profile names implicated in the case include former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and former finance minister Miftah Ismail.</p>
   <h3>Shahid Khaqan Abbasi</h3>
   <p>Abbasi served as prime minister from 2017 to 2018, and was also the minister for petroleum and natural resources from 2013 to 2017. He has denied any wrongdoing in the award of the LNG contracts, and has accused the government of selectively targeting opposition politicians.</p>
   <h3>Miftah Ismail</h3>
   <p>Ismail served as finance minister from 2018 to 2019, and was previously a senior executive at Engro Corporation, a major Pakistani conglomerate. He has also denied any wrongdoing, and has argued that the NAB's allegations are politically motivated.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The investigation into the LNG scandal is seen as a litmus test for the NAB, which has faced criticism in the past for failing to bring corrupt officials to justice. The watchdog has vowed to continue its efforts to uncover corruption at all levels of government, and has urged the public to support its efforts.</p>
   <p>Going forward, it remains to be seen whether the NAB will be successful in prosecuting those accused of involvement in the LNG scam. However, the case highlights the need for effective measures to combat corruption in Pakistan, which has long been plagued by allegations of graft and mismanagement.</p>
   <p>As the NAB's investigation continues, it is hoped that those responsible for causing losses to the national exchequer will be held accountable, and that measures will be put in place to ensure transparency and accountability in all areas of government.</p>
