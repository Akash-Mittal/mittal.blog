   <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <p>On September 11, 2017, Rahul Gandhi, the Vice-President of the Indian National Congress party, spoke at the University of California, Berkeley. During his speech, he criticized Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for "not espousing the values that are so important to India".</p>
   <p>Gandhi's speech brought to light the differing values of Indian politicians, and the role they play in shaping the country's future. In this article, we will explore this issue in more detail.</p>

   <h2>A story of two politicians</h2>
   <p>Let us begin with a story of two politicians - Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar.</p>
   <p>Modi and Kumar come from very different backgrounds. Modi was born into a lower-middle-class family in Gujarat, while Kumar was born into a family of modest means in Bihar. Despite their humble beginnings, both men rose to prominent political positions in India.</p>
   <p>However, the similarities end there. Modi is known for his authoritarian style and his Hindu nationalist ideology. He has been accused of human rights violations and of suppressing dissent. Kumar, on the other hand, is known for his inclusive approach and his commitment to social justice. He has been praised for his efforts to improve education and healthcare in Bihar.</p>
   <p>Modi and Kumar represent two very different visions for India. Modi's vision is one of Hindu nationalism, economic growth, and a strong military. Kumar's vision is one of social justice, education, and healthcare for all.</p>
   <p>The question is, which vision will prevail in India?</p>

   <h2>Case studies</h2>
   <p>Let us now look at some case studies that highlight the differing values of Indian politicians.</p>
   <h3>Case study 1: Gujarat riots</h3>
   <p>In 2002, when Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, communal riots broke out in the state. The riots resulted in the deaths of over 1,000 people, most of them Muslims. Modi was accused of not doing enough to stop the violence, and of even encouraging it. The incident raised serious questions about Modi's commitment to religious tolerance and his ability to govern effectively.</p>
   <h3>Case study 2: Aadhaar scheme</h3>
   <p>The Aadhaar scheme, launched in 2009 by the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government, aimed to provide a unique identification number to all Indian citizens. The scheme was intended to help the poor and marginalized sections of society, who often lacked proper identification documents. However, the Modi government has been accused of turning the scheme into a surveillance tool, and of violating the right to privacy of citizens.</p>
   <h3>Case study 3: Universal Basic Income</h3>
   <p>In 2017, Kumar proposed the idea of a Universal Basic Income (UBI) for India. The UBI would provide a fixed monthly income to all citizens, regardless of their economic status. The proposal was aimed at reducing poverty and inequality in the country. However, the Modi government has rejected the idea, arguing that it is not feasible in the Indian context.</p>
   <p>These case studies highlight the differing values of Indian politicians. While some politicians focus on communalism and economic growth, others are committed to social justice and inclusivity. The question is, which vision will ultimately shape India's future?</p>
  </article>

   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The differing values of Indian politicians are not just a matter of debate - they have serious implications for the country's future. Will India be a country that prioritizes economic growth over social justice, or one that seeks to address the root causes of poverty and inequality?</p>
   <p>Ultimately, the future of India will depend on the choices that its citizens make. They will have to decide whether they want a leader who is divisive and authoritarian, or one who is inclusive and committed to social justice. Only time will tell which vision will prevail.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, Rahul Gandhi's speech at the University of California, Berkeley, has brought to light the differing values of Indian politicians. It is up to the people of India to decide which path they want to take - one of division, or one of inclusivity and social justice.</p>
