    <h3>An Interesting Story</h3>
    <p>Once upon a time, there were two neighboring countries - India and Pakistan. Both countries were created at the same time but had very different political systems. India chose to become a democratic country while Pakistan opted for a dictatorship. Over the years, it became clear that India's decision was the right one as it saw progress in all areas like education, healthcare, and economy while Pakistan faced hurdles in its progress due to the lack of democracy and excessive army intervention.</p>

    <h3>Examples with Case Studies</h3>
    <p>Imran Khan, the current prime minister of Pakistan, recently spoke about how dictatorship and military intervention have hindered progress in his country. He highlighted the fact that during the 70 years of Pakistan's existence, only 2 decades have been spent under democratic rule, which is not enough time for a country to develop. He gave various examples of how dictatorships had caused immense damage to the country's progress and development.</p>
    <p>One such example is the case of East Pakistan, now known as Bangladesh. In 1971, East Pakistan was separated from West Pakistan after a bloody war that resulted in the loss of thousands of lives. The reason behind this separation was the discrimination and neglect faced by East Pakistan due to its geographical location and language. This was only possible because of the dictatorship in Pakistan, which prevented the voices of people from being heard.</p>
    <p>Another example is the economic situation in Pakistan. Despite being a resource-rich country, Pakistan is facing an economic crisis due to the lack of a stable government and the constant interference of the army in its affairs. The country has been forced to borrow heavily from other countries to meet its financial needs. This has resulted in the devaluation of the currency, high inflation, and unemployment, leading to further deterioration of the economy.</p>
    <p>Imran Khan also mentioned how democracy could bring about reforms in various sectors like education and healthcare. He stressed on the need for a stable government that could plan for the future and not just focus on short-term gains. One of the reasons why India has seen progress in these sectors is due to the investments made by its democratic governments over the years. Pakistan, on the other hand, has faced a setback in these areas due to the lack of a stable government.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>The lack of democracy and excessive army intervention has been a major hindrance to Pakistan's progress. The country has faced multiple setbacks due to the unstable political situation, resulting in the loss of lives, economic crisis, and lack of progress in various sectors. Imran Khan's views on the issue are a ray of hope for the country as he is working towards bringing about a positive change and making Pakistan a true democratic country. In the end, it can be said that India was right in choosing the path of democracy for its progress, and Pakistan could learn from its neighbor's success to achieve its goals.</p>
