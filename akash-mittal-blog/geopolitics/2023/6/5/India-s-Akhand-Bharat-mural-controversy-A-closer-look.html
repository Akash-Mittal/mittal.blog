   <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <p>The newly built Parliament building of India has stirred up a hornet's nest due to a mural painted inside the Lok Sabha (lower house) chamber. The mural depicts the map of undivided India, including Pakistan and Bangladesh, with the words "Akhand Bharat" (Undivided India) inscribed below. The mural has generated a furious response from Pakistan and Nepal, who have deemed it as a territorial claim on their sovereign land. India has defended the mural as a mere reflection of its cultural and civilizational heritage. In this article, we will delve deeper into the controversy, explore its historical roots and provide some analytical insights.</p>
   <h2>The Historical Roots of Akhand Bharat</h2>
   <p>The concept of Akhand Bharat or Undivided India traces its origin to ancient Hindu texts like the Puranas and the Mahabharata, which describe a mythical kingdom stretching from the Himalayas to the seas. The phrase "Akhand Bharat" gained currency during India's freedom struggle, when nationalist leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Lala Lajpat Rai used it to invoke the idea of a united India free from British colonialism. After India's partition in 1947 and the creation of Pakistan, the slogan of Akhand Bharat became even more relevant as an expression of the unfulfilled dream of national unity. The Hindu nationalist organization, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), also espoused the idea of Akhand Bharat as part of its Hindu Rashtra (Hindu Nation) vision.</p>
   <h2>The Political Impact of Akhand Bharat</h2>
   <p>The idea of Akhand Bharat has always been a contested and divisive issue in the Indian subcontinent. On the one hand, it appeals to the emotions of those who cherish the romanticized notion of a unitary, culturally cohesive India. On the other hand, it is seen as a hegemonic, exclusionary and expansionist agenda by those who identify with non-Hindu communities and regions that were historically marginalized and discriminated against by the Hindu elites. The demand for Akhand Bharat has often led to violent conflicts and territorial disputes, as witnessed in the cases of Kashmir, Assam, Nagaland, and Manipur. India's neighbors, Pakistan and Nepal, view any assertion of Akhand Bharat as a direct threat to their sovereignty and territorial integrity, as they have been the victims of India's unilateral actions and aggressive posturing in the past. Therefore, any attempt to project the idea of Akhand Bharat through official channels can only exacerbate the already simmering tensions in the region.</p>
   <h2>The Implications of the Akhand Bharat Mural</h2>
   <p>The Akhand Bharat mural in the Lok Sabha chamber is not a mere artistic expression of India's cultural heritage, as claimed by some Indian politicians, but a deliberate political act aimed at asserting the dominance of Hindu nationalism over pluralism and diversity. By depicting a map that includes Pakistan and Bangladesh, the mural not only disregards the history and identity of those countries but also challenges the very basis of India's partition and formation of a secular democracy. The fact that the mural was unveiled at a time when India is witnessing a dangerous rise in communal violence, hate speech, and authoritarianism, only confirms the fears of those who see it as a sign of India's inward turn and regression towards an intolerant and chauvinistic society. The mural has already triggered angry protests in Pakistan and Nepal and forced India to defend its position, thus wasting valuable diplomatic capital and creating an unnecessary distraction from more pressing issues.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The Akhand Bharat mural controversy is not a trivial matter but a symptom of the deeper malaise afflicting India's polity and society. It exposes the fault lines between the proponents of a majoritarian agenda and the defenders of a pluralistic ethos. It highlights the gap between the rhetoric of national unity and the reality of regional diversity. It underscores the need for a more inclusive and equitable vision of India that respects the rights and dignity of all its citizens and neighbors. It also reminds us of the importance of historical memory, cultural empathy, and mutual respect in building peaceful and prosperous relations among nations. In short, the Akhand Bharat mural controversy is a wake-up call for India and the world to reflect on the perils and possibilities of identity politics and nationalism in the 21st century.</p>
