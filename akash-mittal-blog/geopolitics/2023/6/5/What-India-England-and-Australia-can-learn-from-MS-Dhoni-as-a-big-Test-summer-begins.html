    <h2>An interesting story</h2>
    <p>MS Dhoni, former captain of the Indian cricket team, is widely regarded as one of the greatest leaders in cricketing history. One of the reasons for his success was his ability to think strategically and make bold decisions under pressure.</p>
    <p>A classic example of this was in the final of the 2007 T20 World Cup, when India was facing Pakistan. Despite conventional wisdom suggesting that the Indian team should field first, Dhoni took the bold decision to bat first. This decision paid off, as India scored 157 runs and won the match by 5 runs.</p>

    <h2>Examples with case studies</h2>
    <p>Dhoni's leadership style was characterized by his calmness under pressure, his ability to think clearly, and his focus on process rather than outcome. His willingness to take risks and make bold decisions was also a key factor in his success.</p>
    <p>For example, during the 2011 World Cup final, Dhoni promoted himself up the batting order and batted at number five. This decision was unexpected, but it proved to be a masterstroke, as he went on to score an unbeaten 91 and lead India to victory.</p>
    <p>Dhoni's ability to think strategically and make bold decisions was also evident in his captaincy of the Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League. In the 2018 IPL final, Dhoni took the bold decision to promote Shane Watson up the order to open the batting. Watson went on to score a century and lead the Super Kings to victory.</p>
    <p>Overall, Dhoni's success as a leader was based on his ability to think strategically, make bold decisions, and focus on process rather than outcome.</p>
