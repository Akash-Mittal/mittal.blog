  <h1>Nepal Demands Better Terms for Gurkha Soldiers Joining Indian Army</h1> <img src="images/Nepal-Demands-Better-Terms-for-Gurkha-Soldiers-Joining-Indian-Army.jpeg" alt="+Nepal-Demands-Better-Terms-for-Gurkha-Soldiers-Joining-Indian-Army+"><!--Introduction-->
  <p>Nepal, a small country nestled in between India and China, is demanding better terms for its Gurkha soldiers who have been serving in the Indian Army for centuries. The Gurkhas are known for their bravery, loyalty, and military skills, and have been an integral part of the Indian Army since the British Raj era. However, despite their sacrifices and contributions, the Gurkhas have been subjected to unequal treatment and discrimination, prompting Nepal to take action.</p><!--Story-->
  <p>One of the most famous stories about the Gurkhas illustrates their courage and loyalty. During the Battle of Takrouna in World War II, a Gurkha soldier named Lachhiman Gurung defended his position against overwhelming enemy forces, using his rifle to kill and wound dozens of enemy soldiers. When his weapon was destroyed by a grenade, he picked up a nearby Bren gun and continued firing, despite being critically wounded. He was eventually captured by the enemy and sent to a prison camp, where he spent months recovering from his injuries. When he was finally released, he returned to his unit and resumed fighting. Gurung's bravery earned him the Victoria Cross, the highest medal for bravery in the British Army.</p><!--Quantifiable Examples-->
  <p>The Gurkhas have been serving in the Indian Army for more than two centuries, and their contributions are hard to quantify. However, some numbers can help illustrate their importance. According to official figures, there are currently around 32,000 Gurkhas serving in the Indian Army, making up around 7% of its total strength. They are often deployed in border areas, where their knowledge of the terrain and their fighting skills are crucial. Despite their small numbers, the Gurkhas have won numerous awards and medals for bravery and valor, and are respected by their fellow soldiers and commanders.</p><!--Better terms-->
  <p>Nepal is demanding better terms for its Gurkha soldiers, who are currently recruited by the Indian Army under the terms of the Tripartite Agreement between India, Nepal, and the UK. Under this agreement, the Gurkhas are entitled to the same pay and benefits as their Indian counterparts, but they are not allowed to serve in high-ranking positions or in certain specialized units. They are also not eligible for Indian citizenship, and are repatriated to Nepal after their service is over.</p>
  <p>Nepal is demanding that the Tripartite Agreement be revised to include better terms for its Gurkha soldiers. It wants the Gurkhas to be allowed to serve in high-ranking positions, and to be eligible for Indian citizenship. It also wants the Gurkhas to be recruited on the basis of merit, rather than on the basis of ethnicity or caste, which has been a source of controversy in the past. Nepal has threatened to withdraw its Gurkha soldiers from the Indian Army if its demands are not met.</p><!--Conclusion-->
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The Gurkha soldiers have been an integral part of the Indian Army for more than two centuries, and their contributions cannot be overstated. However, their treatment has been unequal and discriminatory, and Nepal is demanding better terms for its soldiers. The Tripartite Agreement between India, Nepal, and the UK needs to be revised to include better terms for the Gurkhas, including the right to serve in high-ranking positions, eligibility for Indian citizenship, and recruitment on the basis of merit. It is time to recognize the sacrifices and contributions of the Gurkhas, and to give them the respect and dignity they deserve.</p>
