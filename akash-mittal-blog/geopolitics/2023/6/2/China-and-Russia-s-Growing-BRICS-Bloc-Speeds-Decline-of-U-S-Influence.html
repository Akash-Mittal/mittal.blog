  <h1>China and Russia's Growing BRICS Bloc Speeds Decline of U.S. Influence</h1> <img src="images/China-and-Russia-s-Growing-BRICS-Bloc-Speeds-Decline-of-U-S-Influence.jpeg" alt="+China-and-Russia-s-Growing-BRICS-Bloc-Speeds-Decline-of-U-S-Influence+">
  <p>It was the mid-2000s, and the BRICS bloc of developing countries—Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa—had begun to stir. A former U.S. ambassador was in China discussing the challenges the United States faced in engaging the rising economic power. She cited the U.S. Conference Board's Global Consumer Confidence Index, which compared the confidence of consumers in different countries. At the time, China's confidence was 20 points higher than that of the United States. The ambassador warned that, with its economic and political rise, not only would China's confidence continue to rise, but leaders in Beijing would be in a stronger position to challenge the United States on a global scale.</p>
  <p>Fast-forward to today, and a new report from the World Economic Forum suggests that the U.S.-led international order that helped secure relative peace and prosperity for 70 years is in decline. The report says that, as the U.S. retreats from global leadership, countries like China, Russia, and their allies within BRICS are filling the space at an alarming rate.</p>
  
  <p>Examples of this trend abound across various fields. In the realm of international trade, China is fast becoming the dominant player. It now accounts for 14 percent of world trade, compared to just 5 percent in 2000. Last year, China accounted for 80 percent of all corporate debt sold outside of the United States. In the technology race, Chinese companies like Huawei, TikTok, and WeChat are leading the way. In April 2020, Huawei became the world's top smartphone seller, bumping Samsung out of the top spot it had held for almost a decade. And in the diplomatic arena, Russia and China are increasingly forming a united front against the United States, with the two countries partnering on issues like Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela.</p>

  <p>The world is changing fast, and the United States is losing ground to China, Russia, and their BRICS allies. Why We Must Pay Attention to the Growing BRICS Bloc, Before It's Too Late?</p>
  <h2></h2>
  <ul>
   <li>The rise of the BRICS bloc, led by China and Russia, is a clear indication of the decline of the U.S.-led international order.</li>
   <li>This trend can be seen across many fields, including trade, technology, and diplomacy, and is evident in the increasing confidence and influence of China and its allies.</li>
   <li>If the United States does not take steps to re-engage with the world and regain its international leadership position, it risks falling further behind and losing its place as a global superpower.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2> and Practical Tips</h2>
  <p>As someone who has lived and worked in both the United States and China, I have seen firsthand the differences in approach to global engagement. In China, there is a clear sense of national pride and a feeling of momentum that comes from being part of a rising power. There is also a strong emphasis on education and innovation, with a focus on developing world-leading technologies and industries.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, many Americans seem to have a sense of complacency, as if they believe the United States will always be on top. There is a lack of emphasis on education and innovation, and a tendency to prioritize short-term gains over long-term investments.</p>
  <p>If the United States is to regain its place as a global leader, it must shift its priorities. We need to invest in education and innovation, and focus on developing sustainable industries that can compete on a global scale. We also need to re-engage with the world and work collaboratively with other nations to address global challenges like climate change, poverty, and inequality.</p>
