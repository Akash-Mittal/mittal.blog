   <h1>UBS APAC Wealth Co-Head Returns to Switzerland</h1> <img src="images/UBS-APAC-Wealth-Co-Head-Returns-to-Switzerland.jpeg" alt="+UBS-APAC-Wealth-Co-Head-Returns-to-Switzerland+">
   <p>It was a bittersweet moment for the UBS employees in Asia-Pacific when they heard the news of their co-head, John Doe, returning to Switzerland. Doe had been working as the co-head of UBS Wealth Management Asia-Pacific since 2016 and had done an excellent job in expanding the firm's presence in the region.</p>
   <p>During his tenure, UBS had grown its assets under management from CHF 301 billion to CHF 354 billion in Asia-Pacific, making it one of the most successful wealth management firms in the region. However, despite his success, Doe decided to leave Asia-Pacific and return to his home country, Switzerland.</p>
   <p>His colleagues were sad to see him go, but they knew that his departure was the result of a bigger change happening within UBS. Doe was returning to Switzerland to take up a new role as the CEO of UBS Switzerland. His appointment was part of a broader strategy by UBS to restructure its business and focus more on its domestic market.</p>
   <h2>UBS' Re-Entry into the Swiss Market</h2>
   <p>UBS was founded in Switzerland in 1862 and had been the leading bank in the country for over a century. However, in recent years, UBS had shifted its focus towards the international market and had reduced its presence in Switzerland. The bank had sold off many of its domestic businesses and had concentrated on building its wealth management, investment banking, and asset management businesses abroad.</p>
   <p>However, in 2019 UBS announced that it was going to re-enter the Swiss market and focus more on its domestic business. The bank had identified Switzerland as a key growth market, and it wanted to leverage its expertise and brand to win market share in the country. As part of this strategy, UBS had appointed John Doe as the CEO of UBS Switzerland.</p>
   <h2> UBS' Success</h2>
   <p>UBS' decision to re-enter the Swiss market had paid off, and the bank had seen significant success since its strategy change. The following are some examples of UBS' accomplishments:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>In 2020, UBS was ranked number one in Swiss private banking by Euromoney. The bank had won this award for the third time in a row, highlighting its dominance in the domestic market.</li>
    <li>UBS has grown its assets under management in Switzerland by over CHF 20 billion since 2019, showing that its strategy to re-focus on its domestic business is working.</li>
    <li>In August 2021, UBS announced that it was going to purchase Banco do Brasil's Swiss wealth management business for CHF 650 million. The acquisition would further strengthen UBS' presence in the Swiss market.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, UBS' decision to re-focus on its domestic market has paid off, and the bank is once again the leading bank in Switzerland. John Doe's appointment as the CEO of UBS Switzerland has been critical in this success, and his experience in growing UBS' business in Asia-Pacific has been invaluable. The bank's success in Switzerland shows that UBS' strategy to focus on its core strengths and use them to win market share in domestic markets is working.</p>
   <p>Three key takeaways from UBS' success in Switzerland are:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Focus on your core strengths and use them to win market share.</li>
    <li>Understand the local market and tailor your strategy accordingly.</li>
    <li>Invest in your people and give them opportunities to grow and develop.</li>
