     <p>During his speech at the India Economic Conclave 2023, Rajnath Singh shared an interesting story from his childhood. He talked about how he grew up in a small village in Uttar Pradesh and had to walk for miles to get to school. He said that one day, he saw a jet fly over his village and he was mesmerized by its speed and power. From that day on, he knew he wanted to join the Air Force and serve his country.</p>
     <p>His story inspired many young people in the audience, who saw him as a role model and a symbol of hope. Rajnath Singh's journey from a small village to the Defense Minister of India is a testament to the country's potential and the power of hard work and determination.</p>
     
     <p>Rajnath Singh spoke about the importance of investing in the defense sector to boost India's economy. He mentioned that the government has allocated Rs. 4.78 lakh crore for defense in the budget for 2023. This investment will create job opportunities and promote technological innovation in the country.</p>
     <p>He also talked about the success of the Make in India initiative, which has led to the production of various defense equipment such as the Tejas fighter jet, Akash missile system, and Varunastra torpedo. These projects have generated employment and helped India save foreign exchange.</p>
     <p>Rajnath Singh emphasized the need for collaboration between the Air Force, Indian Navy, and the private sector to achieve indigenization and self-reliance in defense production. He called upon the private sector to invest in defense research and development and contribute to the country's growth.</p>
