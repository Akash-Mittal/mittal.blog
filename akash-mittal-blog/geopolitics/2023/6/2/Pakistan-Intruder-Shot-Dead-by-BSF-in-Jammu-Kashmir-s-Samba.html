   <p>When it comes to securing India's borders, our security forces leave no stones unturned. The recent news of an intruder from Pakistan being shot dead by BSF in Jammu &amp; Kashmir's Samba is a testament to their bravery and dedication towards the country.</p>
   <p>The incident took place on the night of [Date Here], when the intruder was spotted by the BSF personnel near the international border. Despite repeated warnings, the intruder kept advancing towards the Indian side, forcing the BSF to take action and fire at him. The intruder was hit and eventually succumbed to his injuries.</p>
   
   <p>According to the latest reports, this is not an isolated incident. In fact, infiltration attempts from Pakistan have increased significantly in the last few months. As per the data, there have been:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>75 infiltration attempts from Pakistan in the first six months of 2021</li>
    <li>32 terrorists killed by security forces in these attempts</li>
    <li>237 ceasefire violations by Pakistan in the month of June alone</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>The Need for Tighter Security Measures</h2>
   <p>The increase in infiltration attempts from Pakistan shows that we need tighter security measures along the border. The BSF personnel are already working tirelessly to protect the country, but there are some other measures that can be taken:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Using advanced technology like drones, satellites, and thermal imaging to keep a better watch on the border</li>
    <li>Increasing the number of boots on the ground to ensure that every inch of the border is covered</li>
    <li>Enhancing intelligence gathering to preempt infiltration attempts before they happen</li>
   </ul>
   <h2></h2>
   <p>In conclusion, the recent incident of an intruder being shot dead by BSF in Jammu &amp; Kashmir's Samba is a reminder of the constant threat India faces from across the border. To ensure that such incidents do not happen again, we need to:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Encourage and support our security forces in their efforts to keep us safe</li>
    <li>Use the latest technology and equipment to enhance our security measures</li>
    <li>Stay vigilant and aware of the situation along the border</li>
   </ol>
