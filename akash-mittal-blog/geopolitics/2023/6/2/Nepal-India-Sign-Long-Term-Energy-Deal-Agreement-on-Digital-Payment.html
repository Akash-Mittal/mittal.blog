   <h2>An Interesting Story on the Future of Energy and Finance</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>It was a bright morning, and Mr. Giri, an entrepreneur from Nepal, was ready to start his new solar energy business in his hometown. He had everything planned, from the equipment to the employees, and he was confident that his business would be a success. However, as he started to look for payment solutions for his customers, he encountered a problem. The Nepalese banking system was not equipped to handle digital payments, and most of his customers did not have access to credit cards or online payments.</p>
   <p>Mr. Giri was not alone. Many businesses in Nepal and India have struggled with the same problem, hindering their growth and development. However, this is about to change, thanks to a long-term energy deal agreement between Nepal and India that includes a digital payment system.</p>
   
   <ul>
    <li>The long-term energy deal agreement between Nepal and India is valued at US$2.8 billion.</li>
    <li>The agreement includes a provision for digital payment systems, which will make it easier for businesses to collect payments from customers.</li>
    <li>The energy deal will help Nepal to meet its electricity needs, which are expected to triple by 2040.</li>
    <li>The energy deal is part of India's policy to strengthen its ties with its neighbors and promote regional cooperation.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The inclusion of a digital payment system in the energy deal agreement between Nepal and India is a significant development for the region. It will provide businesses with a much-needed tool to collect payments from customers, which will help to facilitate growth and development in the two countries. The digital payment system will also help to promote financial inclusion, as it will make it easier for people who do not have access to banking services to participate in the economy.</p>
   <h2>The Future of Energy and Finance</h2>
   <p>The long-term energy deal agreement between Nepal and India is a symbol of the future of energy and finance. As the world becomes more interconnected, energy and finance are becoming increasingly intertwined. The ability to access and use energy is a fundamental component of economic growth and development, and so is the ability to make and receive payments. As more countries recognize the importance of these two components, we can expect to see more energy deals that include provisions for digital payments.</p>
   <p>For entrepreneurs like Mr. Giri, the inclusion of a digital payment system in the energy deal agreement between Nepal and India is a godsend. It will allow them to focus on their business operations, rather than worry about collecting payments from customers. It will also help to promote sustainable energy practices, as more people will be able to access and use renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>The long-term energy deal agreement between Nepal and India is a significant development for the region.</li>
    <li>The inclusion of a digital payment system in the energy deal agreement will promote economic growth and financial inclusion.</li>
    <li>The future of energy and finance is becoming increasingly intertwined, and we can expect to see more energy deals that include provisions for digital payments.</li>
