  <p>As a cricket fan, have you ever felt the excitement of witnessing international cricket matches in your own backyard? The thrilling experience of seeing your favorite players in action, the roar of the crowd and the adrenaline rush of a close finish - all this and more form an integral part of the sport we love.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>However, what happens when the series gets cancelled or postponed due to unforeseen circumstances? This is exactly what has been happening lately due to the Covid-19 pandemic, leaving fans and cricket boards disappointed, financial losses, and the fear that it may lead to a significant impact on the sport.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Recently, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had cancelled the upcoming Test series against England due to the Covid-19 pandemic and several other reasons. This has come as a huge blow to the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and Cricket Australia, both of whom had suffered significant financial losses due to the postponement of their respective tours to India.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The ECB had to cancel its limited-overs tour to India scheduled for September-October 2020. It had included three ODIs and three T20Is. The tour was to take place at the end of England team's trip to Australia for the Ashes series. When it was cancelled, it not only resulted in financial losses but also left the players feeling disappointed as they had missed out on a crucial opportunity to prepare for the T20 World Cup.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Similarly, Cricket Australia had postponed its white-ball tour of India scheduled for January 2020. The series included three ODIs and three T20Is. The postponement of the tour meant that Australia missed out on valuable match practice ahead of the T20 World Cup, which was scheduled to be held in Australia later that year.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The cancelled series has had a significant impact on cricket. It has not only resulted in financial losses to the boards and players but also had an impact on the fans. In India, cricket is more than just a sport - it is a way of life. People here are passionate about the game, and it is a source of entertainment and pride. The cancellation of the series has left fans heartbroken and disappointed.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Furthermore, the impact of cancelled series is not limited to financial losses and the impact on fans. It also has a wider impact on the sport as a whole. Cricket, like any other sport, needs to be played regularly at the international level to maintain its popularity and relevance. The series cancellation means that teams are losing out on crucial match practice, and players are missing out on the opportunity to improve their skills and showcase their talent.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Consequently, the situation calls for immediate action from the BCCI to ensure that cricket continues to thrive, and the impact of the pandemic is minimized. The following are some steps that the board could consider:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Rescheduling the postponed series: The BCCI could look into rescheduling the tours that were postponed due to the pandemic. This way, the players get a chance to gain valuable match practice, and the fans can once again witness high-quality cricket.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Finding alternate venues: If rescheduling is not possible, the BCCI could explore alternate venues to host international cricket matches. This will ensure that cricket continues, albeit in a safe environment.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Engaging with other cricket boards: The BCCI could engage with other cricket boards and explore the possibility of arranging alternate tours or series during this time.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, the cancellation of the series has had a significant impact on cricket, its fans, and the boards. The pandemic has brought on unforeseen and challenging times, but it is essential that the BCCI takes action to minimize the impact on the sport. By exploring alternate venues or rescheduling matches, the board can ensure that cricket continues to thrive, and its fans remain engaged.</p>
