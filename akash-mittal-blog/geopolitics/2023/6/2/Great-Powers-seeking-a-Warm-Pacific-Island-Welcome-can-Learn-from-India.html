   <h3>An Analysis of India's Foreign Policy towards Pacific Island Nations</h3>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>India and the Pacific Island nations seem like an unlikely pair. India is a massive nation on the other side of the world from the Pacific, while the islands are small and remote. Nevertheless, India has developed close relationships with many of the island nations. One anecdote from my research highlights this perfectly.</p>
   <p>In February 2019, the Indian government gifted a brand new fast patrol vessel, the VP Ngamia, to the Kenyan government. This vessel is specifically designed for maritime security and will be a useful tool in Kenya's fight against piracy and smuggling. The interesting part of the story is that the VP Ngamia was actually built by an Indian shipyard, but India chose to gift it to Kenya as a sign of friendship and cooperation. This is just one example of how India invests in relations with small and remote nations like those in the Pacific.</p>
   <p>India's foreign policy towards Pacific Island nations is unique and can serve as an inspiration for other Great Powers seeking to build strong relationships in this region. Here are a few quantifiable examples:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>In 2014, India established the India-Pacific Islands Sustainable Development Conference as a platform for dialogue between India and the Pacific Island nations. This conference has been held annually, with the latest edition in 2020 having more than 400 delegates from over 20 countries. Through this platform, India has been able to share its experience and expertise in sustainable development with Pacific Island nations.</li>
    <li>India has also increased its development assistance towards Pacific Island nations. According to the Ministry of External Affairs, India's total aid to Pacific Island nations was around $64 million in 2015-16, which increased to about $76 million in 2017-18. This may seem like a small amount, but for small island nations, every bit helps.</li>
    <li>India has been actively engaging in defence cooperation with Pacific Island nations. In 2014, India gifted a Dornier aircraft to Seychelles, a small island nation in the Indian Ocean. India has also provided patrol vessels to Mauritius and Maldives. In 2019, India conducted a joint naval exercise with four Pacific Island nations - Fiji, Tonga, Vanuatu, and Papua New Guinea. This was the first naval exercise between India and Pacific Island nations.</li>
   </ol>
   <p>So what can other Great Powers seeking a warm Pacific Island welcome learn from India's approach?</p>
   <h2>Lesson 1: Invest in Sustainable Development</h2>
   <p>Pacific Island nations are extremely vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters. India has shown that investing in sustainable development is a crucial way to build long-term relationships with these nations. By sharing its expertise and resources, India has been able to help Pacific Island nations develop in a way that is both environmentally sustainable and economically viable.</p>
   <h2>Lesson 2: Provide Development Assistance</h2>
   <p>Small island nations often lack the resources to achieve their development goals. India's increasing development assistance is a way to show that it is committed to helping these nations improve their quality of life. Other Great Powers can follow India's lead by providing aid that is tailored to the specific needs of each individual nation.</p>
   <h2>Lesson 3: Engage in Defence Cooperation</h2>
   <p>Maintaining maritime security is crucial for small island nations. India has shown that providing assistance in this area is a way to build trust and cooperation. Joint exercises, like the one conducted in 2019, are a way to demonstrate mutual commitment to the security of the region. Great Powers seeking to build relationships in the Pacific can follow India's lead by engaging in defence cooperation that is respectful of the sovereignty of Pacific Island nations.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>India's foreign policy towards Pacific Island nations is a unique example of how a Great Power can build strong relationships with small and remote nations. By investing in sustainable development, providing development assistance, and engaging in defence cooperation, India has established itself as a trusted partner in the Pacific. Other Great Powers seeking a warm Pacific Island welcome can learn from India's approach and build relationships that are mutually beneficial and respectful.</p>
