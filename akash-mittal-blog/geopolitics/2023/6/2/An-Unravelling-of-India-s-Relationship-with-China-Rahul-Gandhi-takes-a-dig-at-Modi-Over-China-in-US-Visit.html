  <h1>An Unravelling of India's Relationship with China: Rahul Gandhi takes a dig at Modi Over China in US Visit</h1> <img src="images/An-Unravelling-of-India-s-Relationship-with-China-Rahul-Gandhi-takes-a-dig-at-Modi-Over-China-in-US-Visit.jpeg" alt="+An-Unravelling-of-India-s-Relationship-with-China-Rahul-Gandhi-takes-a-dig-at-Modi-Over-China-in-US-Visit+">
  <p>India and China have had a tumultuous history, rife with border disputes, military clashes, and proxy wars. Recently, the two countries have been at loggerheads over a Himalayan territory called Doklam, resulting in military build-ups and increased tensions. The situation has reached such a boiling point that India's opposition leaders have taken a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a recent US visit.</p>
  <h2>Modi's China Policy</h2>
  <p>Modi's relationship with China has been embroiled in controversy since he became the Prime Minister in 2014. His government has pursued a policy of "India First," which has been at odds with China's ambitions of becoming a global superpower. Consequently, India has opposed China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a massive infrastructure project that seeks to connect Asia, Africa, and Europe through a network of highways, ports, and railways.</p>
  <p>Modi has also taken a tough stance on China's territorial ambitions in the South China Sea and signed military agreements with countries such as Japan, Australia, and the United States to counter China's growing influence in the region. However, his government's response to the Doklam standoff has been lukewarm, with many critics accusing him of being soft on China.</p>
  <p>Moreover, several reports have suggested that China has been taking advantage of India's economic vulnerabilities, flooding the country with cheap goods, and blocking its entry into the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG).</p>
  <h2>Rahul Gandhi's Criticism</h2>
  <p>During his recent visit to the United States, Rahul Gandhi, India's opposition leader, criticized Modi's handling of the Doklam situation and accused him of pursuing a "simplistic" foreign policy that is damaging India's interests. Gandhi said, "India's relations with China are at an all-time low. Doklam is a cautionary tale that illustrates the dangers of pursuing simplistic foreign policies that lack strategic foresight."</p>
  <p>Gandhi's criticism comes at a time when India's relationship with China is rapidly unraveling, and Modi's government seems to be at a loss for a coherent response. Many experts have warned about the risks of confrontation with China, given its military and economic might. India's economy largely depends on China, which is its biggest trading partner.</p>
  
  <p>Several factors have contributed to the deteriorating relationship between India and China. Here are some quantifiable examples:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Trade Deficit: China is India's largest trading partner, with a massive trade deficit of $63.12 billion in 2017-18. This means that India imports far more goods from China than it exports to the country.</li>
   <li>Belt and Road Initiative: India has refused to join the BRI, citing concerns about its political, economic, and strategic implications. China has already invested heavily in countries such as Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Nepal, raising eyebrows in India.</li>
   <li>Military Build-up: The Doklam standoff, which lasted for 73 days, saw a massive build-up of troops and military hardware on both sides.</li>
   <li>Border Disputes: India and China share a 3,488 km-long disputed border, which has been a source of tension between the two countries for decades. Several rounds of talks have failed to resolve the issue.</li>
   <li>NSG Membership: China has been blocking India's entry into the NSG, arguing that it is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The deteriorating relationship between India and China is a cause for concern, not just for the two countries but for the entire world. A military clash between the two Asian giants could have disastrous consequences, especially at a time when the world is grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic and economic recession. Here are three key takeaways from the situation:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>India needs to tread carefully in its dealings with China and avoid confrontation as much as possible. Modi's government must pursue a more nuanced and strategic foreign policy that takes into account both India's interests and its limitations.</li>
   <li>India must diversify its trade and investment portfolio and reduce its dependence on China. This could include expanding ties with other countries such as Japan, South Korea, and the United States.</li>
   <li>There is a need for dialogue and engagement between India and China to resolve their differences in a peaceful manner. The two countries must build mutual trust and confidence, which can only come through sustained diplomacy and goodwill.</li>
  </ol>
