     <p>It was a beautiful sunny day when the Indian Army received a report from one of its forward observation posts (OPs) near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) about the unusual movements of Chinese aircraft. The report was immediately forwarded to the higher authorities who were puzzled as to why the Chinese were moving their aircraft so close to the Indian border. As it turns out, the Chinese were setting up one of their airbases in the region, which had gone unnoticed until now.</p>
     <p>This was just one of the many instances where China is silently scaling up its air power along the LAC. According to the latest satellite images that we have obtained, China has been building new airbases, expanding the existing ones, and deploying the latest fighter jets and transport planes in the region. The aim seems to be to gain a major strategic advantage over India, which has been caught off guard by the sudden Chinese aggression.</p>
     <p>One of the most quantifiable examples of China's air power buildup is the expansion of the Hotan airbase near the LAC. As per the satellite images, China has deployed advanced Su-30 fighter jets and Y-20 transport planes at the airbase, which can fly at higher altitudes and travel longer distances than India's aging aircraft. This gives China an unfair advantage in the region as they can easily outmaneuver and outpace the Indian Air Force (IAF) in case of a conflict.</p>
     <p>Another example of China's air power build-up is the construction of a new airbase in the Tibet Autonomous Region. This airbase is strategically located and can provide China enough cover to launch a surprise attack on India's military locations in case of a conflict. The satellite images show the presence of J-11 and J-16 fighter jets, both of which are superior to India's MiG-21 and Su-30MKI aircraft.</p>
     <p>In addition to building new airbases and deploying advanced fighter jets and transport planes, China is also enhancing its infrastructure along the LAC. The latest satellite imagery shows new and upgraded runways, taxiways, and maintenance facilities at some of the existing airbases. This allows China to maintain a higher operational tempo and keep its aircraft ready for action at a moment's notice.</p>

     <h2>The Way Forward</h2>
     <p>India must take the Chinese air power buildup along the LAC seriously and respond effectively. Here are three points that can help India:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>Invest in Modernization: India must invest in the latest fighter jets, transport planes, and other military equipment to counter the Chinese threat. The IAF needs to be equipped with the latest technology and weaponry to stay competitive with China.</li>
      <li>Improve Infrastructure: India must also improve its infrastructure along the LAC to match China's. This includes building new airbases, expanding the existing ones, and upgrading the runways and maintenance facilities. This will allow India to maintain a high operational tempo and deploy its aircraft quickly if needed.</li>
      <li>Enhance Cooperation: Finally, India must enhance cooperation with other friendly countries to counter the Chinese aggression. Countries like the US, Japan, and Australia can provide India with the latest military technology and help in the joint development of new equipment and weapons.</li>

     <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
     <p>One of the most interesting case studies is that of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who was captured by the Pakistani Army during the Balakot airstrike in February 2019. This incident highlighted the lack of preparedness of the IAF in handling such situations. It is vital that India invests in better equipment and training for its soldiers.</p>
     <p>Another personal anecdote comes from a retired Indian Air Force officer who highlighted the deteriorating condition of the MiG-21 fighter jets that India still uses. According to him, the MiG-21 is a death trap for Indian pilots and needs to be replaced urgently.</p>
