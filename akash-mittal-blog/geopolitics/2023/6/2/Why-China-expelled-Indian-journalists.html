    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>In March 2020, China expelled 13 Indian journalists working in the country. This move came in response to similar actions taken by the Indian government, which had refused to renew visas for Chinese journalists working in India.</p>
    <p>The move caused a diplomatic rift between the two countries, which has only increased since then. Tensions between China and India have been high for several reasons, including border disputes and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.</p>
    <p>But why did China specifically target Indian journalists for expulsion? And what does this say about China's approach to the media?</p>
   </section>
   <section id="examples">
    
    <p>There are several possible reasons why China expelled Indian journalists. One factor could be the ongoing border dispute between the two countries. This dispute has been going on for several decades, and has recently flared up again, with both sides accusing each other of border violations. In this context, China may see Indian journalists as a potential threat to its national security. By expelling them, China could be sending a message to India that it will not tolerate any interference in its affairs.</p>
    <p>Another possible reason could be China's increasingly strict approach to the media. In recent years, China has cracked down on journalists, bloggers, and social media influencers who criticise the government or raise issues that are deemed sensitive. This has had a chilling effect on the media in China, with many journalists self-censoring out of fear of retaliation.</p>
    <p>Finally, China's decision to expel Indian journalists could be seen as a tit-for-tat response to India's own actions. By expelling Chinese journalists, India was sending a message that it too would not tolerate interference in its affairs. China may have seen the expulsion of Indian journalists as a way to assert its own power and authority in the region.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, the expulsion of Indian journalists from China is just one example of the complex and often fraught relationship between the two countries. It is likely that multiple factors played a role in China's decision, including the ongoing border dispute, China's approach to the media, and a desire to assert its own power and authority. What is clear is that both countries need to find a way to resolve their differences and work together towards a more stable and peaceful future.</p>
    <h3>Three Points to Remember:</h3>
    <ol>
     <li>China's decision to expel Indian journalists was likely driven by several factors, including the ongoing border dispute and China's approach to the media.</li>
     <li>The expulsion of Indian journalists should be seen as part of a larger pattern of tensions between China and India, rather than an isolated incident.</li>
     <li>To resolve their differences, China and India need to find a way to work together towards a more stable and peaceful future.</li>
