    <p>Trina is a Chinese student pursuing her master's degree in computer science at a top US university. She is fascinated by artificial intelligence and has been using Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) to develop a machine learning algorithm for predicting weather patterns. However, her research came to a sudden halt when the US government added Nvidia to its Entity List in April 2021, citing national security concerns.</p>
    <p>Trina was disheartened, but her disappointment was short-lived. A few weeks later, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced that he was willing to engage with Chinese regulators to resolve the issue and resume business in China, which is a crucial market for Nvidia's GPUs. This move was unexpected, given the frosty US-China relations and the sanctions imposed on Chinese tech companies by the US.</p>
    <p>So, why is Jensen Huang so keen on China talks despite US curbs?</p>
    
    <p>The answer lies in the numbers. China accounted for 23% of Nvidia's revenue in the last fiscal year, which is a staggering $5 billion. Nvidia's GPUs are used not only in gaming and data centers but also in AI applications such as autonomous driving, natural language processing, and medical imaging. China has ambitious plans in these areas and is willing to invest heavily in AI research and development. The potential for Nvidia to tap into this market is enormous.</p>
    <p>Moreover, China's lead in AI has been acknowledged by industry experts worldwide. In the latest Global AI Index, China ranked first in terms of research, development, and deployment of AI technologies. Nvidia understands the importance of collaborating with leading companies and universities in China to stay ahead of the competition and to access new talent and technologies.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, China's regulatory environment has become more favorable for foreign tech companies in recent years. The establishment of the Greater Bay Area in southern China, which aims to integrate Hong Kong, Macau, and nine other cities in Guangdong province into a high-tech hub, has created new opportunities for Nvidia to expand its business and form partnerships with local firms.</p>
    <h2>The Magnetic Title</h2>
    <p>Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang is bucking the trend with a bold move: China talks despite US curbs</p>
    <h2></h2>
    <ol>
     <li>Nvidia's revenue from China is significant and growing, making it a crucial market for the company to tap into.</li>
     <li>China's lead in AI and its favorable regulatory environment make it an attractive destination for foreign tech companies like Nvidia to collaborate with local firms and access new talent and technologies.</li>
     <li>Jensen Huang's decision to engage with China despite US curbs reflects his long-term vision for Nvidia's growth and success in the global AI market.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Trina's story is just one example of how the US-China trade war has affected the tech industry. However, it also illustrates the interconnectedness of the global economy and the need for companies to navigate the complexities of different markets and regulatory regimes.</p>
    <p>As someone who has worked in the tech industry for over a decade, I have seen firsthand the opportunities and challenges of doing business in China. One of the key lessons I have learned is the importance of building trust and relationships with local partners and stakeholders. This is especially true in a country where personal connections and guanxi play a significant role in business dealings.</p>
    <p>If Nvidia wants to succeed in China, it needs to invest in local talent, adapt to the cultural norms and regulations, and build a strong reputation as a reliable and trustworthy partner.</p>
