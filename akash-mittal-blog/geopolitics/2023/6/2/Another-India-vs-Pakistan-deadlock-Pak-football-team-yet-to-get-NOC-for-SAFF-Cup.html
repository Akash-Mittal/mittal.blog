  <h1>Another India vs Pakistan deadlock - Pak football team yet to get NOC for SAFF Cup</h1> <img src="images/Another-India-vs-Pakistan-deadlock-Pak-football-team-yet-to-get-NOC-for-SAFF-Cup.jpeg" alt="+Another-India-vs-Pakistan-deadlock-Pak-football-team-yet-to-get-NOC-for-SAFF-Cup+">
  <p>It was a sunny Friday afternoon in Lahore, Pakistan, and the national football team was gearing up for their upcoming SAFF Cup match against India. The coach was going over strategies with the team, and the players were practicing their footwork on the field. But amidst all the excitement and anticipation, there was a looming sense of uncertainty.</p>
  <p>Three weeks had already passed since the SAFF Cup was announced, and the Pakistani team was yet to receive their NOC - No Objection Certificate. In simpler terms, it's a document that allows the team to travel abroad and represent their country in international tournaments.</p>
  <p>The players were hopeful that the NOC would come through in time for the match, but as the days passed, it became increasingly clear that they may have to sit this one out.</p>
  <h2>The impact of India vs Pakistan deadlock on football</h2>
  <p>The India vs Pakistan cricket matches are famous across the world for their intensity and rivalry. But what many people don't know is that a similar rivalry also exists in football. Every time the two countries face off against each other, it's not just a game - it's a matter of pride.</p>
  <p>But the current deadlock between India and Pakistan is having a detrimental impact on the sport. It's not just the SAFF Cup that's affected - many international football matches involving Pakistan have been cancelled in recent years due to political tensions between the two nations. As a result, Pakistani football players are missing out on opportunities to showcase their talent and compete against other teams from around the globe.</p>
  <p>The lack of international exposure is also impacting the development of the sport in Pakistan. Without regular matches against other countries, the national team is unable to gauge their progress and identify areas for improvement. The local football scene is also suffering, as there's less interest in the sport when there are no major matches taking place.</p>
  <h2>Quantifiable examples of the impact</h2>
  <p>The impact of the India vs Pakistan deadlock on football may seem like an abstract concept, but here are some quantifiable examples to illustrate the point:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Pakistan's national football team dropped a total of 12 places in FIFA rankings between 2018 and 2020.</li>
   <li>Due to the lack of international matches, the team has played only eight matches in the last three years. In comparison, Nepal, another team in the SAFF region, played 23 matches during the same period.</li>
   <li>In 2019, the Pakistan Premier League was cancelled due to the lack of interest from sponsors, and a lack of revenue from ticket sales.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>The way forward</h2>
  <p>It's clear that the current stalemate between India and Pakistan is having an adverse impact on football in Pakistan. But what can be done to break this cycle and move forward?</p>
  <h3>1. Separation of sports from politics</h3>
  <p>One possible solution is to separate sports from politics. Just because there are tensions between two nations, it shouldn't mean that athletes have to suffer. The International Olympic Committee has a rule that prohibits any political propaganda or demonstration during their events, and a similar rule could be applied to football tournaments as well. This would ensure that players are able to compete freely, without any interference from political forces.</p>
  <h3>2. Increased investment in local football</h3>
  <p>Another way to promote football in Pakistan is to invest more in the local scene. This could include a greater focus on youth development, facilities and infrastructure improvement, and greater support for local teams. By building a strong local base, it would be easier for the national team to tap into a wider pool of talent, and be able to compete at a higher level internationally.</p>
  <h3>3. Collaborative efforts between India and Pakistan</h3>
  <p>Finally, it's important for India and Pakistan to work collaboratively towards promoting football in the SAFF region and beyond. This could include joint training sessions, tournaments, and friendly matches. By working together, both countries could benefit from the increased exposure and recognition that comes with being part of the international football community.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The India vs Pakistan deadlock is having a detrimental impact on football in Pakistan. It's time for sports and politics to be separated, and for greater investment and collaboration between the two nations in the sport of football. Only then can we truly unlock the potential of Pakistani football and allow it to compete on a global stage.</p>
