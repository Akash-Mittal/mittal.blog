   <p>Austin, the United States' defense secretary, expressed his disappointment in Singapore on Friday, as he revealed that he was unable to secure a meeting with his Chinese counterpart. The unfruitful visit by the defense secretary is a huge setback to the relationship between the United States and China.</p>
   <h2>Causes of No Talk Between the US and China</h2>
   <p>The strained relationship between the two superpowers may have caused Chinese officials to decline a meeting with Austin during his visit. The United States and China have been at loggerheads over a range of issues from the COVID-19 pandemic, trade war, human rights, and Taiwan. Austin had earlier voiced his concerns about China's military expansion and said that the US is ready to counter threats that it sees from China.</p>
   <p>This was Austin's first visit to Asia since he took over from his predecessor, Mark Esper, earlier this year. The Secretary of Defense had been hoping to meet with his Chinese counterpart to dialogue about reducing tensions. Unfortunately, he was not able to secure the meeting, although Austin says that he remains open to "constructive, stable, and professional" dialogue.</p>
   <h2>The Implications of No Talks with China</h2>
   <p>The breakdown of communication between the two superpowers is a worrying sign of the deteriorating relationship. Although the US government says that it is not looking for conflict with China, the absence of meaningful dialogue could lead to more tensions and escalation of conflict.</p>
   <p>The decision by Beijing not to meet with Austin underscores the challenges faced by the Biden administration in trying to find common ground with China. President Biden has made it clear that he wants to build a stable and predictable relationship with China, but this has been a difficult task given the complexities of the relationship between the two countries.</p>
   <h2>The Way Forward</h2>
   <p>The absence of a meeting between the two defense secretaries underscores the need for both countries to find ways to restart meaningful dialogue. This could be in the form of virtual meetings or through diplomatic channels. Both countries need to find common ground and identify areas where they can work together, rather than focus on areas of differences.</p>
   <p>The US and China are the world's largest economies and their relationship is essential for global stability. Both nations need to urgently address the challenges that they face in the relationship and find ways to cooperate. Failure to do so could have serious implications for the global economy and may lead to increased tensions and conflict.</p>
