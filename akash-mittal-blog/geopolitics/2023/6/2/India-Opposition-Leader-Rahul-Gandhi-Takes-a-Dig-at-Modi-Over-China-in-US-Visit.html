    <h2>An interesting story</h2>
    <p>In a recent visit to the United States, the Indian Opposition Leader, Rahul Gandhi, criticized the current Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, over his handling of the China issue. Rahul Gandhi, who is known for his outspoken nature, took this opportunity to take a jab at Modi in front of a gathering of Indian-American communities.</p>
    <p>While addressing the crowd, Rahul Gandhi pointed out that Modi was "busy posing for cameras" and "hugging world leaders", while China was quietly encroaching on India's territory. This statement drew loud applause from the audience, and the video of the speech quickly went viral on social media.</p>

    <h2>Quantifiable examples</h2>
    <p>Rahul Gandhi's criticism of Modi's approach to the China issue was not unfounded. In recent years, China has been aggressively expanding its influence in South Asia, often by encroaching on the territory of neighboring countries. In 2020 alone, China and India were involved in several deadly border clashes, resulting in the deaths of dozens of soldiers on both sides.</p>
    <p>India's response to these incidents has been criticized by many, including some in the Indian government. In particular, Modi has been accused of downplaying the seriousness of the situation and failing to take strong action against China. This has led to tensions between India and China rising to their highest level in decades.</p>
    <p>As evidence of China's expansionism, Rahul Gandhi cited several examples, including its building of a road through disputed territory, its deployment of troops along the border, and its construction of military infrastructure near the Indian border. These actions have heightened concerns among Indians about China's intentions and India's ability to protect its sovereignty.</p>
