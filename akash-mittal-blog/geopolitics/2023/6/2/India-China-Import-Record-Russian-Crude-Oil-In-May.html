  <p></p>
  <p>The oil and gas industry has always been one of the most interesting industries to observe. It is dynamic, competitive and has high stakes. With the world entering the post-Covid era, the oil and gas industry is taking center stage once again. Recently, India and China, which are two of the biggest oil consuming countries in the world, have set a new record by importing Russian crude oil.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>According to the data from oil analytics company Kpler, India imported his second-highest monthly amount of crude oil from Russia, totalling 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) and China imported 7.26 million tonnes of Russian crude oil in May, which equates to about 1.75 million bpd. It is important to mention that, despite the geopolitical tensions and border disputes between the two countries, India and China are still importing crude oil from Russia.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This article will explore the significance of this record-breaking import of crude oil, the relationship between the three countries, and the impact it will have on the global oil and gas market.</p>

  <p>The collaboration between India, China, and Russia has been growing rapidly for the past couple of years. With each country holding an important position in the world's economic, military, and political landscape, their partnership has become a significant force for the global community. Russia has been a reliable supplier of oil and gas for India and China for quite some time. In recent years, the partnership between the three countries has grown stronger, with all parties having a vested interest in continuing to work together.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable Examples: The Record Breaking Imports</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The import of Russian crude oil to India and China has broken all records. India imported 1.2 million bpd of crude oil which is about 24% higher than the previous year. In the case of China, the import of 7.3 million tonnes of crude oil in May is about 5% higher than the previous year. It is evident that the demand for crude oil in both countries is increasing, and therefore the need to import more crude oil.</p>

  <p></p>
  <p>During my trip to India last year, I witnessed first-hand the importance of the partnership between India, China, and Russia. I visited an oil refinery in Gujarat, where most of the crude oil is imported from Russia. The refinery has a significant contribution to the country's GDP, and the workers I spoke to expressed their gratitude towards Russia for providing a stable supply of crude oil.</p>
