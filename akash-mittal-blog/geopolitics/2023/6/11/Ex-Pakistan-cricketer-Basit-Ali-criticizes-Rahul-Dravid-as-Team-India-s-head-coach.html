   <p>It was a crucial match for Team India. They were up against England in the third test of the series, with the score tied at 1-1. The match was being played at Headingley, Leeds, and the conditions were overcast, which could have favored the fast bowlers. India won the toss and elected to field first. But little did they know that it was the beginning of their downfall.</p>
   <blockquote>
    "India lost the match they moment they opted to field first after worrying about the overcast conditions," said Basit Ali, a former cricketer from Pakistan.
   </blockquote>
   <p>Basit Ali had strong opinions about Team India's head coach, Rahul Dravid, and did not hold back when he criticized him as a coach.</p>
   <h2>Zero as a Coach</h2>
   <p>"As a coach, he is absolutely zero," Basit Ali said in an interview with 'Aaj Tak'. "He has no idea what to do, how to do it. He is just happy to be there as a coach."</p>
   <p>Basit Ali's comment has stirred up a controversy in the cricketing world, with many questioning his credibility and expertise as a commentator. However, his comments cannot be entirely ignored.</p>
   <h2>Examples and Case Studies</h2>
   <p>In the past, Rahul Dravid has been praised for his contributions as a coach, especially with the India A and Under-19 teams. He has been credited with grooming young cricketers and preparing them for the international level.</p>
   <p>However, Basit Ali feels that Dravid's success as a coach with the youth teams does not necessarily translate to success at the senior level.</p>
   <blockquote>
    "Coaching a senior team is different than coaching an Under-19 or India A team. You have to take tough decisions, make changes, and manage egos. Dravid doesn't seem to have that ability."
   </blockquote>
   <p>Basit Ali also cited the recent poor performances of Team India under Dravid's coaching. India lost the World Test Championship final to New Zealand and were defeated by England in the first two tests of the series.</p>
   <h2></h2>
   <p>Here are a few key takeaways from Basit Ali's criticism of Rahul Dravid as Team India's head coach:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Basit Ali feels that Rahul Dravid is not an effective coach for the senior Indian cricket team.</li>
    <li>Dravid's success with the youth teams does not necessarily translate to success at the senior level.</li>
