    <h2>Historical Background</h2>
    <p>The Harappan civilization, also known as the Indus Valley civilization, was one of the oldest urban civilizations in the world and flourished during the Bronze Age in the Indian subcontinent. Its artefacts are highly prized and preserve a glimpse into the ancient history of humanity.</p>
    <p>After the Independence of India and Pakistan in 1947, the question of the ownership of Harappan artefacts became a contentious issue that had to be addressed diplomatically. In this context, the Dancing Girl, a bronze statue discovered in Mohenjo-daro in 1926, became an emblematic figure of this debate.</p>

    <h2>Interesting Cases</h2>
    <article>
     <h3>The Misinformed Agencies</h3>
     <p>Even after the partition, there were agencies from both sides of the border who made untenable claims for the transfer of ownership of the Dancing Girl. These claims were often based on nationalist sentiment rather than historical or legal evidence.</p>
     <p>However, in 2016, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) made a scientific analysis of the artefact and proved that it indisputably belonged to the Indian heritage. This study silenced the misinformed agencies who had been calling for the return of the Dancing Girl to Pakistan.</p>

     <h3>The Bearded Priest</h3>
     <p>The case of the Bearded Priest is another fascinating example of the Harappan artefacts ownership controversy. The Bearded Priest is a terra cotta figurine that was discovered in Harappa in 1923 and was part of the National Museum collection in New Delhi, India.</p>
     <p>However, in 2016, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, announced that it had acquired the figurine from an anonymous donor who claimed that it was part of the excavated collection at Harappa in the early 20th century and it was acquired by a British army officer. The claim raised concerns about the provenance of the artefact and the possibility of illegal trafficking.</p>
     <p>After a detailed investigation by the International Council of Museums (ICOM), it was concluded that the Bearded Priest had indeed been part of the National Museum collection and had been illegally exported to the US. As a result, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, returned the artefact to the Indian government in 2018.</p>

     <h3>The Shared Heritage</h3>
     <p>While the question of ownership of Harappan artefacts is often debated between India and Pakistan, it is important to remember that these artefacts represent a shared heritage of humanity. They belong to a distant past that predates the modern political division of the Indian subcontinent, and their value lies in their cultural, artistic, and historical significance.</p>
     <p>Therefore, it is essential that both India and Pakistan work together to preserve and promote the artefacts of the Harappan civilization for future generations. Cultural diplomacy and international collaborations can go a long way to strengthen our common bonds as human beings and to celebrate our diversity.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The ownership of Harappan artefacts is a complex issue that touches upon historical, legal, and cultural dimensions. The Dancing Girl, along with other artefacts, remains a symbol of this ongoing debate between India and Pakistan.</p>
    <p>However, beyond the question of ownership, there is a deeper concern that we must address, which is the preservation of our shared cultural heritage. As international citizens, it is our responsibility to promote cultural diplomacy and protect the cultural patrimony of humanity.</p>
    <h3>In summary, we can conclude that:</h3>
    <ol>
     <li>The ownership of Harappan artefacts is a contentious issue that requires scientific analysis and historical evidence.</li>
     <li>International collaborations and cultural diplomacy can help to preserve our shared heritage and promote mutual respect.</li>
     <li>The artefacts of the Harappan civilization, including the Dancing Girl, belong to a distant past that transcends modern political borders and offer us a glimpse into our common human history.</li>
