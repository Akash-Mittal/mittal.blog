  <p>As the world is grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, the government of Pakistan is busy with its nefarious agenda of illegally occupying the land of Gilgit Baltistan (GB) and Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK). The United Kashmir People's National Party (UKPNP) has expressed its concerns regarding the ongoing illegal land grabbing and construction activities carried out by Pakistan in PoK and GB.</p><img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/11/kashmir-pok-representational-1200.jpg" alt="Illegal Land Grabbing by Pakistan in PoK and GB">
  <p>According to UKPNP, the people of PoK and GB are suffering due to the lack of basic facilities such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. Instead of focusing on the development of these areas, Pakistan is indulging in illegal activities, which is a violation of human rights and international laws.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Illegal Land Grabbing and Construction Activities</h2>
  <p>Let's take a look at some of the examples of illegal land grabbing and construction activities carried out by Pakistan in PoK and GB:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>CPEC Corridor:</strong> The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a multi-billion dollar infrastructure project, which passes through GB and PoK. Pakistan is building highways, railroads, and energy projects under this project, which has resulted in the displacement of thousands of people.</li>
   <li><strong>Tourism Projects:</strong> Pakistan is promoting tourism in GB and PoK, but the development of tourism projects is carried out without the consent of local people. Many people have lost their lands and livelihood due to the construction of tourist facilities.</li>
   <li><strong>Mining Projects:</strong> Pakistan is carrying out mining activities in GB and PoK without any environmental assessment or compensation to local people. The mining projects have resulted in the depletion of natural resources, damage to the environment, and loss of ancestral lands.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These are just a few examples of the illegal activities carried out by Pakistan in PoK and GB. The people of these areas have been suffering for decades due to the oppressive policies of Pakistan, and the situation is getting worse day by day.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies of Human Rights Violations</h2>
  <p>Let's take a look at some of the case studies of human rights violations in PoK and GB:</p>
  <div class="quote">
   <p><em>"Pakistan has illegally annexed our land. They have taken our rights to life, liberty, and property. We are living in a state of oppression and fear. Our voices are not heard, and our human rights are violated every day."</em></p>
  </div>
  <p><strong>Case Study 1:</strong> In October 2020, a massive landslide in GB resulted in the death of nine people, including three children. The government of Pakistan did not provide any assistance to the affected families, and the local people had to launch a rescue operation on their own. This incident highlights the neglect of the government towards the people of GB.</p>
  <p><strong>Case Study 2:</strong> In January 2020, a group of people in PoK protested against the construction of a dam on the Jhelum river, which is a lifeline for the people of PoK. The protesters were met with violence by the police, and many people were injured. This incident highlights the violation of the right to peaceful protest by the government of Pakistan.</p>
  <p><strong>Case Study 3:</strong> In October 2019, a local journalist in GB was abducted and tortured by the Pakistan Army for reporting on human rights violations in the area. The journalist was kept in illegal custody for several days and was subjected to physical and mental torture. This incident highlights the restriction on freedom of expression and the violation of human rights by the Pakistan Army.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The situation in PoK and GB is dire, and the people of these areas are suffering due to the oppressive policies of Pakistan. The illegal land grabbing and construction activities carried out by Pakistan are a violation of human rights and international laws. Pakistan must stop its nefarious agenda and focus on the development of these areas. The international community must take note of the situation and intervene to protect the human rights of the people of PoK and GB.</p>
