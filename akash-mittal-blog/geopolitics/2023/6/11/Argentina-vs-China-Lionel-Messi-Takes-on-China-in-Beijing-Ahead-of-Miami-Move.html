   <p>Lionel Messi, the legendary Argentine footballer, is set to play against China in a friendly match ahead of his move to Major League Soccer side Inter Miami. This marks the end of his storied European career with Barcelona, where he played for 17 years and achieved countless accolades.</p>
   <p>As Messi prepares for his new journey in the United States, let's take a look at some case studies of other footballers who made a similar move.</p>
   <h2>David Beckham: From Manchester United to LA Galaxy</h2>
   <p>David Beckham, the former England captain, joined Major League Soccer side LA Galaxy in 2007 after a successful career in Europe with Manchester United, Real Madrid and AC Milan. Despite initial skepticism, his move to the United States was a huge success both on and off the field. He won two MLS Cups with LA Galaxy and helped increase the popularity of football in the country.</p>
   <h2>Thierry Henry: From Arsenal to New York Red Bulls</h2>
   <p>Thierry Henry, the French forward known for his time at Arsenal, joined New York Red Bulls in 2010. Although he was already past his prime, he still managed to score 51 goals in 122 appearances and was named MLS Best XI in his first two seasons. After retiring from playing, he became a coach and is now the head coach of CF Montréal.</p>
   <h2>Zlatan Ibrahimović: From Europe to LA Galaxy and AC Milan</h2>
   <p>Zlatan Ibrahimović, the Swedish striker known for his time at Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United, joined LA Galaxy in 2018. He scored 53 goals in 58 appearances, won the MLS Newcomer of the Year award and was named to the MLS Best XI twice. After a brief return to Europe with AC Milan, he is now playing for AC Milan's rival club, Inter Milan.</p>
   <p>These case studies show that footballers can succeed in the United States and that the league is growing in popularity. As Lionel Messi makes the move to Inter Miami, here are three key takeaways:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The United States is a viable destination for footballers looking for a new challenge.</li>
    <li>Football's popularity is increasing in the United States, and the league is becoming more competitive.</li>
    <li>Star players like David Beckham, Thierry Henry and Zlatan Ibrahimović have helped elevate the league's profile and attract more talent.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>As Lionel Messi takes on China in Beijing, football fans around the world are eagerly anticipating his move to the United States and his impact on Major League Soccer.</p>
