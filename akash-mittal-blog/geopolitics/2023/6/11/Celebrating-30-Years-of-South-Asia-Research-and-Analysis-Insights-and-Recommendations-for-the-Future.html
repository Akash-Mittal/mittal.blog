  <p>India and Pakistan have been in territorial dispute over the region of Kashmir for decades. The conflict has resulted in numerous deaths and violence in the region. In 2019, tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors escalated to a dangerous level. The tensions were so high that both countries engaged in an aerial battle which resulted in the loss of Indian and Pakistani fighter aircraft.</p>
  <p>This story is just one example of how the South Asia region has been facing various challenges in the sphere of security, economy, health, and human rights. The Stimson Center South Asia Program has been contributing towards research and analysis of South Asia issues for the past 30 years. The program has been at the forefront of generating analysis and insights, developing recommendations for policymakers, and building networks of practitioners and scholars in the South Asian region.</p>
