   <h2>Interesting Story</h2>
   <p>The India-Pakistan rivalry in cricket is one of the biggest in the world and every time these two teams face each other, the excitement is palpable. The 2019 World Cup match between India and Pakistan was viewed by an estimated one billion people, making it one of the most-watched cricket matches ever. The passion for the sport is unparalleled and the upcoming World Cup 2023 is expected to be no different.</p>
   <h2>World Cup 2023 Schedule</h2>
   <p>The World Cup 2023 schedule is yet to be finalized, but according to reports, Chennai is likely to host the much-anticipated India-Pakistan match. The ICC meeting, which will be held in the next 48 hours, will decide the venues for the upcoming World Cup.</p>
   <h2>ICC Meeting to Decide World Cup Venues</h2>
   <p>The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) have been at loggerheads over the past few years. The tense political situation between the two countries has spilled over into cricket and has affected bilateral series between India and Pakistan. The upcoming World Cup has become another battleground for BCCI and PCB.</p>
   <p>The ICC meeting will be crucial in deciding the venues for the World Cup, especially with regard to India and Pakistan matches. The BCCI has said that it cannot play in Pakistan due to security concerns, but the PCB has insisted that it will not accept a neutral venue for the match. The situation is complex and a diplomatic solution is needed to resolve the issue.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <h3>India vs Pakistan World Cup Matches</h3>
   <p>The India-Pakistan World Cup matches have been some of the most-watched and memorable cricket matches in history. The 1996 quarter-final match between the two teams is particularly unforgettable. India batted first and scored 287 runs in their allotted 50 overs. In response, Pakistan were bowled out for 248, giving India a 39-run victory. The match was played at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore, which is one of the possible venues for the India-Pakistan World Cup match in 2023.</p>
   <h3>Neutral Venues in Cricket</h3>
   <p>Neutral venues in cricket have been used in the past for various reasons. For example, during the 2010 IPL, the games were moved out of India due to security concerns related to the general elections. The tournament was held in South Africa, which served as a neutral venue. Similarly, in 2012, Pakistan hosted an ODI series against Australia in the UAE due to security concerns. The use of neutral venues in cricket is not ideal, but it can be a useful tool in certain situations.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The upcoming World Cup 2023 is expected to be a thrilling and exciting tournament. The India-Pakistan match is one of the most highly anticipated matches in the tournament, but the current political tension between the two countries has made the situation complex. The ICC meeting to decide the venues for the tournament is crucial, and a diplomatic solution is needed to resolve the issue. The passion for cricket in India and Pakistan is unparalleled, and it is important that the game is not affected by political tensions.</p>
