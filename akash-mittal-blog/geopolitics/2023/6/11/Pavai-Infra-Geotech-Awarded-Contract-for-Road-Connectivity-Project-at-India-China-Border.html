  <p>The India-China Border is one of the most strategically important borders in the world.

With this deal, the company has yet again showcased their expertise in building infrastructure in harsh conditions.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>

This tunnel, named the Zojila pass tunnel, was built at a height of 11,578 feet and was completed in record time. The tunnel was built to provide all-weather connectivity to the region and is expected to boost economic growth in the area.</p>
  <p>Another project that Pavai Infra Geotech was involved in was the construction of a road-cum-rail bridge across the river Ganga in Patna, Bihar. The bridge is a vital link between north and south Bihar and is the largest road-cum-rail bridge in the country.
