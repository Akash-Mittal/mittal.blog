    <p>Cricket has always been more than just a game for both India and Pakistan. It is an emotion that connects the two nations despite all the differences. The rivalry between the two countries has always been intense, and the matches between them are always anticipated with bated breath. However, political tensions between the two nations have often led to the cancellation of cricket matches between them. But, there have been instances where cricket has managed to bring the two nations together despite the animosity. One such example is the heartwarming story of Indian and Pakistani cricket fans coming together to celebrate the match between the two countries in the 2019 ICC World Cup.</p>

    <h2>PCB Hybrid Model to Get Go Ahead</h2>
    <p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has proposed a hybrid model for the upcoming Asia Cup 2023, which is reported to get the acceptance of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC). The proposed model suggests that the tournament be held in two phases – one phase in Pakistan and one phase in another country. This would allow for the participation of all the teams, including India, as India-Pakistan matches cannot be held in Pakistan owing to political tensions. While there has been no official announcement, reports suggest that the India-Pakistan matches would be played in Sri Lanka, while the rest of the tournament would be held in Pakistan.</p>

    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>The proposal for a hybrid model is not new in cricket. In fact, the model has been successfully implemented in the past as well. The 2021 IPL was held in India and the UAE in a similar model due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Another instance is the 2020 &amp; 2021 Pakistan Super League (PSL) that was held in two phases – one phase in Pakistan, and the second phase in Abu Dhabi due to the pandemic. Both instances have shown that a hybrid model can be successful, and the proposed model for the Asia Cup 2023 has the potential to bring together cricket fans from all over Asia.</p>
