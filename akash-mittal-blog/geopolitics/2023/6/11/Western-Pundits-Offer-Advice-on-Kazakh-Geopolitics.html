  <p>When it comes to geopolitics, Kazakhstan has always been a key player in Central Asia. Its vast natural resources, strategic location and stable political environment make it a valuable partner for many countries around the world, including the European Union.</p>
  <p>Recently, Euractiv spoke to former diplomats who offered some insights into the potential for cooperation between Kazakhstan and the EU, as well as some warnings about the growing influence of China in the region. Here are some of the key takeaways from their advice:</p>
  <h2>Kazakhstan has a lot to offer the EU</h2>
  <p>According to the former diplomats, Kazakhstan's potential as a partner for the EU is significant. As a member of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), Kazakhstan has access to a vast market of more than 180 million people, which is a huge potential customer base for European companies. Kazakhstan is also a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and has been working to improve its business environment, which makes it an attractive destination for foreign investment.</p>
  <p>One of the most promising areas for cooperation between Kazakhstan and the EU is energy. Kazakhstan is home to some of the world's largest oil and gas reserves, which are of great interest to European energy companies. Additionally, Kazakhstan is investing heavily in renewable energy, which could create opportunities for European firms in this field.</p>
  <div class="case-study">
   <h3>Case Study: The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline</h3>
   <p>One example of successful cooperation between Kazakhstan and the EU is the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline, which transports oil from Azerbaijan via Georgia to the Turkish Mediterranean coast. Kazakhstan was one of the main supporters of the project and has been using the pipeline to export its own oil to international markets. The pipeline was constructed with the help of European companies and has been an important contributor to energy security in Europe.</p>
  </div>
  <h2>China is becoming a major player in Central Asia</h2>
  <p>While the potential for economic cooperation between Kazakhstan and the EU is great, the former diplomats cautioned against underestimating the growing influence of China in the region. China has been investing heavily in Kazakhstan, particularly in the energy sector. In 2014, China's CNPC purchased an 8.33% stake in the Kashagan oilfield, which is one of the largest oilfields in the world. Additionally, China has been investing in transport infrastructure in the region, including rail networks and pipelines. This has led some to worry that China's influence in Central Asia could challenge the EU's own interests in the region.</p>
  <p>However, the former diplomats also noted that Kazakhstan is well aware of the risks of becoming too dependent on China and is working to diversify its sources of investment and cooperation. There is also potential for cooperation between the EU and China in Kazakhstan, particularly in the area of renewable energy.</p>
  <div class="case-study">
   <h3>Case Study: The Belt and Road Initiative</h3>
   <p>China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a massive infrastructure program that aims to connect China to markets in Asia, Europe, Africa and beyond. One of the key components of the BRI is the construction of the China-Kazakhstan pipeline, which transports oil from Kazakhstan to China. The pipeline has significant strategic importance for China as it provides an alternative route for its energy imports, which currently come mainly by sea. However, there are concerns that the BRI could lead to increased Chinese influence in Central Asia, which could challenge the interests of other powers such as the EU and Russia.</p>
