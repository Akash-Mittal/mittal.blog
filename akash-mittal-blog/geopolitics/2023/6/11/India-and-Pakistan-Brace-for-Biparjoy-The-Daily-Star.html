  <p>Coastal states of India and neighbouring Pakistan were on alert yesterday after meteorologists warned that a cyclonic storm over the Arabian sea would intensify over the next 24 hours. The storm, named ‘Biparjoy', is likely to hit the coast of Gujarat and Sindh, potentially causing significant damage to property and infrastructure.</p>
  <h2>The Impact of Cyclones on Coastal Communities</h2>
  <p>For coastal communities in India and Pakistan, Cyclones are a common threat. The most recent storm to cause significant damage was Cyclone Vayu, which hit Gujarat last year. The storm damaged 3 lakh houses, killed over 100 animals, uprooted trees, and knocked out power and communication lines.</p>
  <p>According to a World Bank report, the impact of Cyclonic storms on coastal communities can be catastrophic. The report states that since 1990, 155 major disasters have affected India, causing losses of over $50 billion. Out of these, 47% were caused by Cyclonic storms.</p>
  <h2>Case Study: The Devastating Impact of Cyclone Phailin in Odisha</h2>
  <p>In October 2013, Cyclone Phailin hit India's East Coast, affecting about 12 million people across six coastal states. In Odisha, one of the worst affected states, about 12 lakh people had to be evacuated. Despite the massive evacuation effort, over 40 people lost their lives in the storm. The Cyclone caused widespread damage to property, infrastructure and agriculture, affecting the livelihoods of millions of people.</p>
  <h2>Preparing for ‘Biparjoy'</h2>
  <p>In the wake of the Cyclonic storm, the Indian and Pakistani governments have taken several measures to prepare for the impact. In India, the National Disaster Management Authority has been working with the state governments to evacuate people from low-lying areas and provide them with shelter, food, and medical aid. The Indian Meteorological Department has been closely monitoring the storm and providing regular updates on its trajectory.</p>
  <p>This preparation is crucial to minimize the impact of the storm and protect the lives and livelihoods of millions of people. It is a reminder of the need for better disaster preparedness and the importance of investing in resilient infrastructure. By strengthening the coastal defenses, improving early warning systems, and building resilient infrastructure, we can better protect coastal communities from the devastating impacts of Cyclonic storms.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Cyclonic storms are a recurring threat to coastal communities in India and Pakistan. These storms not only cause immense human suffering but also lead to significant economic losses. By investing in disaster preparedness and building resilient infrastructure, we can minimize the impact of these disasters and protect the lives and livelihoods of millions of people.</p>
