    <p>Imagine putting on a headset and stepping into a parallel universe. A universe where you can control the parameters, manipulate objects with your hands, and interact in ways that were previously impossible. Welcome to the world of Extended Reality, where the lines between the virtual and the real world blur into one.</p>
    <p>Advancements in technology have led to the creation of Mixed Reality, a combination of Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality. Mixed Reality (MR) can create an immersive experience by overlaying digital content onto the real world, augmenting your physical surroundings. MR can also incorporate physical objects that respond to your commands, creating an interactive experience that feels like magic.</p>
    <h2>The Rise of Extended Reality</h2>
    <p>The use of Extended Reality has expanded into various industries since its inception. The gaming industry has embraced it whole-heartedly, with game developers working towards incorporating MR into their games, similar to the popular game - "Pokemon Go." Using MR technology, Pokemon Go allows players to hunt for virtual creatures in the real world on their mobile device's screen. Another example is IKEA, who created an MR app that allows customers to preview and place virtual furniture in their homes. This leads to a much more personalized shopping experience.</p>
    <p>Extended Reality has also been used in the medical field for training purposes. It offers a low-risk environment for surgeons and medical students who wish to practice complex surgeries. Through Mixed Reality technology, students can practice the operations on virtual organs and get real-time feedback on their performance, avoiding costly mistakes.</p>
    <h2>Robotics - A Path to a Better Future</h2>
    <p>Robotics plays a critical role in the development of Extended Reality. Using robots in conjunction with MR can create a seamless experience in a variety of industries. For example, Toyota developed a robotic exoskeleton that helps paralyzed patients walk again. The exoskeleton works by sensing the patient's movements and providing support to their legs using robotic technology.</p>
    <p>Another significant development in the use of robots is in disaster response and relief efforts. Robotics can be used in areas that are too dangerous or inaccessible for humans. After the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, robots were used to survey the site and assess the damage. They were also used to clean up debris and clear obstacles during the relief efforts.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The possibilities of Extended Reality and Robotics are endless. It has immense potential to revolutionize various industries, from entertainment to healthcare to disaster response. The combination of these two technologies can create an immersive experience that feels like magic.</p>
