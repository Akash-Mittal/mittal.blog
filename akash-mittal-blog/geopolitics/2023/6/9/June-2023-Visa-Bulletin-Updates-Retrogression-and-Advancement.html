   <p>John and Lily are both highly skilled professionals from India. They have been waiting for years to finally receive their green cards and be able to settle permanently in the United States. John works in the tech industry and has been sponsored by his employer, while Lily is a healthcare professional and has been sponsored by her spouse who is a U.S. citizen.</p>
   <p>For John and Lily, the June 2023 Visa Bulletin update from the U.S. Department of State brings mixed news. While John's employment-based green card category has retrogressed, delaying his eligibility for a visa, Lily's family-based green card category has advanced, bringing her closer to finally receiving her green card.</p>
   <h2>Retrogression and Advancement</h2>
   <p>The June 2023 Visa Bulletin updates are released every month by the U.S. Department of State. These updates determine when a foreign national can file for their green card or when their visa can be issued, based on the priority date and country of origin.</p>
   <p>In some cases, the priority dates may advance, bringing applicants closer to receiving their visas or green cards. In other cases, the dates may retrogress, meaning that the eligibility for a visa or green card is delayed.</p>
   <p>In John's case, the employment-based green card category for his country of origin has retrogressed from March 1, 2021 to January 1, 2017. This means that John, who had been waiting for years to finally receive his green card, will now have to wait even longer due to the delays caused by retrogression.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, Lily's family-based green card category has advanced from May 22, 2016 to June 15, 2016. This means that Lily, who has been waiting for years to finally receive her green card, is now closer to being eligible for the visa and settling permanently in the United States.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <p>John and Lily are just a couple of examples of the thousands of foreign nationals who are affected by each Visa Bulletin update. Let's take a closer look at some other case studies to understand the impact of retrogression and advancement on their green card applications.</p>
   <h3>Case Study 1: Employment-Based Retrogression</h3>
   <p>Raj, a software engineer from India, has been sponsored by his employer for an employment-based green card. He has been waiting patiently for his turn to receive the visa, but unfortunately, the June 2023 Visa Bulletin update has brought bad news for him.</p>
   <p>The employment-based green card category for India has retrogressed from March 1, 2021 to January 1, 2017. This means that Raj, who had been expecting to receive his green card soon, will now have to wait for several more years, further delaying his plans to settle in the United States with his family.</p>
   <h3>Case Study 2: Family-Based Advancement</h3>
   <p>Maria, a nurse from Mexico, has been waiting for years to receive her family-based green card. Her husband is a U.S. citizen who has sponsored her for the visa.</p>
   <p>The family-based green card category for Mexico has advanced from May 22, 2016 to June 15, 2016, bringing Maria closer to being eligible for her green card. This is great news for Maria and her family, as they can finally plan their future and settle permanently in the United States.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The Visa Bulletin updates can have a significant impact on the lives of foreign nationals who are waiting for their green cards or visas. While some may see advancement and be hopeful for their future in the United States, others may experience retrogression and despair, delaying their plans and putting their lives on hold.</p>
   <p>It is important for foreign nationals to stay up-to-date with the Visa Bulletin updates and understand the impact on their green card applications. They should also seek the help of experienced immigration lawyers to guide them through the complex process and maximize their chances of success.</p>
