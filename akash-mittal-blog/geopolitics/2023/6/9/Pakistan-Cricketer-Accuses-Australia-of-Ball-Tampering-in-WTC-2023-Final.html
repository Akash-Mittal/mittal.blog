   <p>The World Test Championship 2023 Final between India and Australia was one of the most anticipated cricket matches of the year. Fans from all over the world were glued to their screens, eagerly waiting to see which team would come out on top. However, the match was marred by controversy when former Pakistan cricketer and coach Basit Ali accused Australia of ball tampering.</p>
   <p>According to Basit Ali, the umpires of the match did not do enough to prevent Australia from tampering with the ball, especially during the dismissals of Indian batsmen Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara. He claimed that the Australian bowlers deliberately altered the condition of the ball in order to gain an unfair advantage.</p>
   <p>Ball tampering is a serious offence in cricket, and it has led to the suspension and even the banishment of players. The incident in the WTC 2023 Final sparked a heated debate among cricket fans, with some supporting Basit Ali's allegations and others defending the Australian team.</p>
   <h2>Examples with Case Studies</h2>
   <p>The issue of ball tampering in cricket is not a new one. There have been several instances in the past where players have been accused of tampering with the ball. One of the most high-profile cases was the ball-tampering scandal involving the Australian cricket team in 2018.</p>
   <p>During a Test match against South Africa, Australian players Cameron Bancroft, Steve Smith, and David Warner were caught on camera using sandpaper to alter the condition of the ball. The incident caused a massive uproar in the cricketing world, and the players involved were heavily penalized.</p>
   <p>Another famous case of ball tampering is that of former England captain Michael Atherton. In 1994, Atherton was caught on camera rubbing dirt on the ball during a Test match against South Africa. He later claimed that he had done it to keep his hands dry, but he was fined and reprimanded by the International Cricket Council (ICC).</p>
   <h2></h2>

    <li>Ball tampering is a serious offence in cricket, and it undermines the integrity of the game.</li>
    <li>The incident in the WTC 2023 Final has once again brought the issue of ball tampering to the forefront, and it is important for cricketing authorities to take strong action against any players found guilty of the offence.</li>
    <li>Cricketers should play the game with honesty and sportsmanship, and avoid resorting to unfair tactics to gain an advantage.</li>
