   <p>Recently, India's External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar spoke on India's stance on the ongoing border standoff with China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). He highlighted India's determination to stand up against China's adventurism and also stressed on how India has successfully delegitimised Pakistan's state-sponsored terrorism. This statement comes at a time when India and China are trying to find a diplomatic solution to the LAC issue that arose in May 2020.</p>
   <h2>India's Response to China's Aggression</h2>
   <p>India has been firm on its stance that China's aggression along the LAC was uncalled for and a breach of trust. India has responded to China's aggression with equal measures, not backing down from its position. Recently, India banned 118 Chinese apps, including the popular game PUBG, citing security concerns. India has also taken measures to reduce its reliance on Chinese imports, including imposing higher tariffs on Chinese goods and encouraging domestic manufacturing.</p>

     <h3>Galwan Valley Clash</h3>
     <p>The Galwan Valley clash on June 15, 2020, was a turning point in India-China relations.
