   <p>For many years, South Korea has been caught in a difficult position between its neighbor to the north, North Korea, and its close ally to the west, China. However, in recent years, South Korea has taken a more assertive and principled posture towards the two countries, according to experts on national security strategy.</p>
   <p>One example of this is South Korea's decision to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, a U.S.-made missile defense system, to protect against North Korean missile threats. China strongly opposed the deployment, arguing that the system's powerful radar could be used to spy on its own missile capabilities. Despite intense pressure from China, South Korea stood firm in its decision, arguing that it was necessary to protect its citizens from the threat of North Korean missiles.</p>
   <p>Another example is South Korea's efforts to engage in dialogue with North Korea. While many countries have taken a hard-line approach towards the isolated nation, South Korea has pursued a policy of dialogue and engagement, believing that a peaceful resolution to the conflict is possible. This approach was seen in the historic inter-Korean summit in April 2018, where South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un met and discussed the future of the region.</p>
   <p>Finally, South Korea has also taken a principled stance on human rights abuses in North Korea. While many countries have been reluctant to speak out against North Korea's human rights violations, South Korea has been a vocal critic, pushing for greater accountability and transparency. This was seen in the United Nations' adoption of a resolution on North Korea's human rights abuses in 2014, which was co-sponsored by South Korea.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>THAAD deployment</strong>: In 2016, South Korea announced its decision to deploy the THAAD system to protect against North Korean missile threats. The decision was met with fierce opposition from China, which argued that the system's powerful radar could be used to spy on its own missile capabilities. Despite this, South Korea stood firm in its decision, arguing that it was necessary to protect its citizens from the threat of North Korean missiles.</li>
    <li><strong>Inter-Korean summit</strong>: In April 2018, South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un met in Panmunjom for a historic inter-Korean summit. The two leaders engaged in discussions on a range of topics, including denuclearization, peace and security, and inter-Korean relations. The summit was seen as a major breakthrough in relations between the two countries.</li>
    <li><strong>Human rights abuses</strong>: South Korea has been a vocal critic of North Korea's human rights abuses, pushing for greater accountability and transparency. In 2014, the United Nations adopted a resolution on North Korea's human rights abuses, which was co-sponsored by South Korea. The resolution called for the establishment of a Commission of Inquiry to investigate the abuses and hold those responsible accountable.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>South Korea's more assertive and principled posture towards North Korea and China has been driven by a desire to protect its citizens and promote peace and stability in the region. While it has faced significant opposition from both countries, South Korea has shown that it is willing to take a stand on issues that it believes are important.</p>
   <p>By deploying the THAAD system, engaging in dialogue with North Korea, and speaking out against human rights abuses, South Korea has shown that it is a responsible global actor with a commitment to upholding international norms and values. While the road ahead remains challenging, South Korea's principled posture towards North Korea and China could pave the way for a more peaceful and prosperous future for the region.</p>
