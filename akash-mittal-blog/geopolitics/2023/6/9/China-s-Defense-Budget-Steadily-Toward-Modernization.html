    <h2>The Story of China's Defense Budget Increase</h2>
    <p>In the past ten years, China's defense budget has increased steadily, leading to speculation about China's military ambitions. However, this increase in investment is not new. China has been investing in modernizing its military since the late 1990s, with the intention of becoming a global power. The increase in the defense budget is only a reflection of this long-term investment.</p>
    <p>China's military modernization includes research and development of new weapons and technologies, improving the capabilities of its armed forces, and increasing its global military presence. This investment in modernization has led to China becoming one of the top military powers in the world after the United States, according to the Global Firepower Index.</p>
