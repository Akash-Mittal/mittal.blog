  <p>Imagine you're sitting in a press conference, fielding questions about a new mural in your country's parliament that has sparked anger and objections from neighbouring nations. One of the reporters asks why the mural depicts a map of your country that includes the territories claimed by those nations. What do you say?</p>
  <p>That's the situation India's External Affairs Minister (EAM) S Jaishankar found himself in recently, when he spoke about the Akhand Bharat mural in the Indian Parliament and the objections raised by Pakistan.</p>
  <h2>The Context</h2>
  <p>The Akhand Bharat mural depicts a map of India as it existed before the partition in 1947, including the territories that are now Pakistan and Bangladesh. Pakistan has objected to this depiction, saying that it shows India's expansionist designs and undermines its territorial integrity.</p>
  <p>EAM Jaishankar's response to this was blunt:</p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>"Pakistan doesn't have the capacity to understand."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This statement has sparked a lot of debate and controversy, with some accusing Jaishankar of being arrogant and insensitive. But others have defended him, saying that he was speaking the truth.</p>
  <h2>The Capacity to Understand</h2>
  <p>What does it mean to have the capacity to understand? It means having the ability to comprehend and appreciate the nuances and complexities of a situation, and to see things from multiple perspectives.</p>
  <p>For example, if we look at the dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, we can see that both sides have their own narratives and grievances. Indians point to the fact that Kashmir has been an integral part of India since independence, while Pakistan argues that the majority-Muslim population of Kashmir should have the right to self-determination.</p>
  <p>To someone who lacks the capacity to understand, this dispute might seem simple: India is the aggressor and Pakistan is the victim. But the reality is much more complicated, with historical, cultural, and geopolitical factors at play.</p>
  <p>Another example of the capacity to understand can be seen in the field of international diplomacy. Skilled diplomats are able to navigate complex power dynamics, cultural differences, and competing interests to negotiate agreements that benefit all parties involved.</p>
  <h2>The Importance of Understanding</h2>
  <p>Why is the capacity to understand so important? For one thing, it allows us to avoid misunderstandings and conflicts that can arise from a lack of comprehension. When we take the time to listen to and empathize with others, we can find common ground and reach mutually beneficial solutions.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, understanding is essential for building strong relationships and alliances, whether they are between individuals, organizations, or nations. When we appreciate each other's perspectives and values, we are more likely to work together effectively and achieve common goals.</p>
  <p>Finally, the capacity to understand is an essential quality for leaders, whether they are in government, business, or civil society. Leaders who are able to see things from multiple perspectives and communicate effectively with diverse constituencies are more likely to be successful at achieving their objectives and inspiring others to do the same.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>At the end of the day, the capacity to understand is a crucial skill that we should all strive to develop. Whether we are dealing with personal relationships, political disputes, or international diplomacy, our ability to appreciate the perspectives of others and work towards common solutions is what will ultimately lead to success.</p>
  <p>So let's take a cue from EAM Jaishankar and remember that when it comes to understanding complex issues, not everyone has the capacity to do so. But by striving to cultivate this quality in ourselves and others, we can build a more just and peaceful world.</p>
