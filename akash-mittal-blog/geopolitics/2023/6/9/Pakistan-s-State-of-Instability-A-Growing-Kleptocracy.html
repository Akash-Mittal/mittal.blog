  <p>Ahmed sat on the side of the road, the dust clinging to his skin and clothes, a look of desperation etched on his face. He had been driving his rickshaw for hours and barely earned enough to feed his family. To make matters worse, the authorities demanded a bribe at every checkpoint, eating into his already meagre earnings. Ahmed was not alone in his struggle against corruption. In Pakistan, bribery, kickbacks, and embezzlement have become ubiquitous, leading to a state of instability and mismanagement.</p>
  <p>What led to Pakistan's current state of affairs? Below are some factors that have contributed to the country's growing kleptocracy:</p>
  <h2>Unsustainable Economic Policies</h2>
  <p>Pakistan has historically suffered from a series of economic crises, leading to repeated bailouts from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF has repeatedly called on Pakistan to implement structural reforms, but successive governments have failed to do so. Instead, they have relied on short-term fixes and populist policies that have worsened the situation in the long run.</p>
  <p>For example, in 2018, the government of Pakistan decided to devalue the rupee to address its balance-of-payments crisis. While this helped in the short term, it made imports more expensive and contributed to inflation. The government also took on more debt, leading to a ballooning fiscal deficit that further weakened the economy.</p>

  <h2>Political Corruption</h2>
  <p>Corruption is a pervasive problem in Pakistan, with a culture of political patronage and nepotism that rewards the well-connected and punishes those outside of the system. This is particularly evident in the country's political leaders, who are often accused of enriching themselves at the expense of the people they are supposed to serve.</p>
  <p>One recent example is the Panama Papers scandal, which implicated former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his family in corruption and money laundering. Sharif was eventually disqualified by the Supreme Court for failing to disclose his assets and offshore accounts, but many saw this as a slap on the wrist compared to the extent of his alleged crimes.</p>

  <h2>Military Influence</h2>
  <p>The Pakistani military has a long history of political interference and influence, with several coups and periods of martial law over the past few decades. While the military has insisted that it intervenes only to protect national security, many see this as a cover for expanding its own power and influence.</p>
  <p>More recently, the military has been accused of rigging the 2018 elections to ensure the victory of current Prime Minister Imran Khan, who is seen as sympathetic to the military. Khan has been criticized for being too close to the military and for failing to address corruption in his own party.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The current state of instability in Pakistan is the result of a complex interplay of economic mismanagement, political corruption, and military influence. Unless these issues are addressed, Pakistan is unlikely to make significant progress in terms of its development and stability. However, there are signs of hope, with civil society and media becoming more vocal in their demands for greater accountability and transparency.</p>
