   <p>As the world became more connected, and globalization became the norm, many countries began to rely on China for their supply chains. However, the COVID-19 pandemic exposed the vulnerability of these global supply chains, and the need for countries to have a diversified supply chain.</p>
   <p>The pandemic highlighted the fact that many countries, especially the U.S and its allies, were relying too heavily on China for the supply of critical minerals, which is essential for the production of key technologies such as electric vehicles and renewable energy systems.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies:</h2>
   <h3>Allkem (OTC:OROCF)</h3>
   <p>Allkem is a U.S. company that specializes in producing and selling critical minerals such as rare earth elements. The company has set its sights on competing with China's monopoly on these resources.</p>
   <p>Allkem has invested heavily in research and development to find new sources of critical minerals, and has formed partnerships with companies and governments around the world to build a more diversified supply chain.</p>
   <h3>Livent (NYSE:LTHM)</h3>
   <p>Livent is a U.S. company that produces lithium, which is a critical mineral used in the production of electric vehicle batteries. The company is also working to break China's monopoly on these resources by expanding its operations both domestically and abroad.</p>
   <p>Livent has also made significant investments in research and development to improve the production efficiency of lithium, with the goal of reducing costs and making it more competitive with China.</p>
   <h2>The Price to Pay</h2>
   <p>Breaking China's monopoly on critical minerals will be a difficult and costly process, but it is necessary to ensure the security and resilience of global supply chains. However, this diversification will come with a cost, as it will lead to inflation and higher prices for critical minerals and the technologies that rely on them.</p>
   <p>Thus, governments and companies must work together to find ways to mitigate the impact of this inflation, such as investing in new technologies and infrastructure, and ensuring fair and sustainable pricing for critical minerals.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
   <p>Breaking China's monopoly on critical minerals is an important step towards building a more resilient and secure global supply chain. However, it is important to acknowledge that this diversification will come with a cost.</p>
   <p>Thus, governments and companies must work together to find innovative solutions to mitigate this impact, while continuing to invest in research and development to improve efficiency and reduce costs.</p>
