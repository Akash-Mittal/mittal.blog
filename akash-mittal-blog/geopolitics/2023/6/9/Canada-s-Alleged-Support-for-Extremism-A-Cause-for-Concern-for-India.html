  <p>It is no news that the relationship between India and Canada has had its fair share of ups and downs, with contentious issues cropping up from time to time. One such issue that has recently come to the forefront is Canada's alleged support for extremism, which has been raising eyebrows in India.</p>
  <p>Addressing a press conference on nine years of Modi government at the Indian High Commission in London, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said that Canada was "giving space to extremists," which was a cause for concern for India. Let us delve deeper into what this means for the India-Canada relationship.</p>
  <h2>Canada's Support for Extremist Elements</h2>
  <p>India has long accused Canada of harboring extremist elements on its soil and providing them with a platform to spread their propaganda. Among them is the Khalistani movement, which seeks a separate homeland for Sikhs and has been known for its violent activities in the past.</p>
  <p>The movement gained traction in the 1980s and 1990s but became dormant in recent years. However, it has seen a resurgence in recent times, with Canada becoming a hotbed of its activities. Indian authorities have repeatedly raised concerns about the Khalistani movement's nefarious activities in Canada, but to no avail.</p>
  <h2>The Impact of Canada's Alleged Support on India-Canada Relationship</h2>
  <p>Canada's alleged support for extremist elements has been a cause for concern for India, as it could potentially harm the relationship between the two countries. There are several areas where this could have an impact, including trade and security.</p>
  <p>One area that could suffer is trade, as India could scale back its trade ties with Canada if it is perceived to be supporting extremist elements. India is Canada's eighth-largest trading partner, and any disruption in trade could have serious consequences for both countries.</p>
  <p>Add to this, the issue of security. If Canada is indeed harboring extremist elements on its soil, it could pose a threat to India's security. This could further damage the relationship between the two countries and lead to a breakdown in ties.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies of Canada's Alleged Support for Extremist Elements</h2>
  <p>There have been several instances where Canada has been accused of supporting extremist elements. Here are a few recent case studies that highlight the issue:</p>
  <h3>1. Canada's Sikh MPs supporting Khalistani movement</h3>
  <p>Several Sikh MPs in Canada have been accused of supporting the Khalistani movement and providing a platform for its propaganda. Among them is Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the New Democratic Party, who has been vocal in his support for the movement, despite its violent past.</p>
  <h3>2. Canada allows pro-Khalistani rallies</h3>
  <p>Canada has been accused of allowing pro-Khalistani rallies to take place on its soil, which promotes the movement's propaganda. This has been a cause for concern for India, as it sees such rallies as a threat to its security.</p>
  <h3>3. Canada refuses to extradite Khalistani terrorists</h3>
  <p>India has repeatedly requested Canada to extradite Khalistani terrorists who are living on its soil, but to no avail. This has further strained the relationship between the two countries and impacted their security ties.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Canada's alleged support for extremist elements remains a cause for concern for India, as it could potentially harm the relationship between the two countries. India has been vocal about the issue, expressing its concerns to Canada on various occasions. However, it remains to be seen how Canada will respond to these concerns and whether it will take concrete steps to address the issue.</p>
