  <p><b>Seoul, South Korea: </b>Only a few years ago, South Korea's handling of North Korea and China was measured, cautious and averse to confrontation, unlike the Trump's blusterous approach to North Korea and China and President Moon's predecessor Park Geun-hye's hardline approach towards North. But as President Moon Jae-in's administration enters its fourth year, it has taken a more assertive and principled stance towards both its neighbors.</p>
  <p>Now, under the new security strategy recently announced by the South Korean presidential Blue House, Seoul has decided to redefine its traditional position of accommodating Beijing and Pyongyang's actions, seeking a more proactive and assertive policy to deal with the different situations that both nations pose on the peninsula, recognizing North Korea as a long-time security threat, and China as a growing geopolitical menace.</p>
  <h2>The Old South Korean Diplomacy</h2>
  <p>South Korea had traditionally relied on pursuing moderate diplomacy in their dealings with China and North Korea. The approach included a political stance of non-interference to Beijing's territorial claims and Pyongyang's nuclear and missile program. It aimed for regional stability, trade benefits, and a belief that the promise of economic cooperation would lead to eventual engagement and peace.</p>
  <p>Their hope was that the benefits of the economic growth would eventually lead to a smooth transition of North Korea as soon as the regime collapsed from within. But these hopes have turned out to be futile as Pyongyang continues to refine its nuclear weapon and ballistic missiles, and the economic growth model that Seoul used to assimilate North Korea into the capitalist world economy failed to produce any intended results.</p>
  <h2>The New South Korean Diplomacy</h2>
  <p>Since coming to power, the Moon administration has taken a more affirmative stance. Moon appointed Chung Eui-yong, a veteran diplomat known for his special interest in security affairs, to become his national security adviser. This signaled an intention to seriously attempt a peaceful resolution to the Korean nuclear crisis.</p>
  <p>By creating his 'New Southern Policy' and 'Northern Policy', Moon has also reoriented South Korea's diplomatic footprint towards Southeast and Central Asia, as well as the Arctic north. This is seen as essential to decouple its economic dependence on China from its geopolitical dependencies that come with it. South Korea is now looking to expand its tech and industrial base, with its collaboration with ASEAN and India seen as a safe and lucrative bet.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, the newly articulated South Korean security strategy has set alarm bells ringing in Beijing and Pyongyang. The Korea Institute for National Unification's report shows that 65% of South Koreans no longer view North Korea as a strategic partner. The White Paper on national defense, published every two years by the South Korean Ministry of National Defense that came out last year, marked the first time Union State of China and Russia were said to pose potential security threats to South Korea.</p>
  <h2>The Advantages of the New Diplomacy</h2>
  <p>1. <b> A sense of security for South Korea - </b> The new stance presents a shield of protection from the unpredictable and irrational behavior of North Korea, with greater South Korea economic independence and stronger links towards its regional partners'. South Korea also seeks a greater role in global governance, and its Pacific islands, in addition to strategic petroleum reserves, have become substantial components of its approach towards greater security. Pyongyang may see Seoul turn to its own strategic diplomacy to provide greater security, leaving Pyongyang to figure out how to exist in a world where its unpredictable leadership and reckless behavior is no longer tolerated.</p>
  <p>2. <b> A greater role as a mediator - </b> The benefit of adopting a more proactive role in promoting peace on the Korean Peninsula and North Pacific. South Korea has the capacity to lead negotiations on security discussions with North Korea, becoming a mediator in the skittish relationship between North Korea, the United States, and the international community. The strategy helps Seoul serve as a reliable conduit between the U.S. and China, playing a strengthening role in the U.S.'s pivot towards the Indo-Pacific and balancing the rising orbit of Beijing's diplomacy.</p>
  <p>3. <b> Economic independence - </b> Seoul seeks a greater role in Asia's manufacturing and technological network which provides specific goods and parts to China's industry-leading export machine. South Korean policymakers realize that it is in their nation's best interest to distance themselves from economic dependence on China's growth. South Korea realizes that diversifying its economic relationships could serve as a mechanism to reduce its vulnerabilities to global economic disruptions and political pressures that Beijing may bring in the future.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The new South Korean diplomacy reflects a changing world order with significant global implications. By redefining their diplomatic stance towards North Korea and China, Seoul has been able to gain a sense of security, rise as a mediator, and distance itself from China's economic dependence. These changes provide a comprehensive roadmap for South Korea to become a more significant regional and global player.</p>
  <p>In the words of Heraclitus, "the only thing that is constant is change." Whether these changes will last and serve their intended purposes remains to be seen, but one thing is sure: the South Korean administration has made a course correction, and it is now more of an assertive player on the global stage.</p>
