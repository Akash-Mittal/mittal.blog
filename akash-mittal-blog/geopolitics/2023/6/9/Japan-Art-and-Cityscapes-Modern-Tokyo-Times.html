  <h2>An interesting Story</h2>
  <p>For centuries, art has played a significant role in Japan's cultural heritage, and the country's artists have produced some of the world's most beautiful artworks. In Tokyo's modern cityscape, there's still passion for art and culture, and the city has become a hub of artistic expression and inspiration.</p>

  <p>The Infinite Connecting System, one of Miyajima's pieces, is a representation of the Buddhist belief in the cycle of birth, death, and reincarnation. It's a powerful piece that has earned him international recognition for his art and has helped to put Tokyo on the global art scene.</p>

It's filled with LED lights that flicker and change colors, creating a mesmerizing effect. Visitors to the installation become part of the artwork, with their reflections repeating endlessly in the mirrors.</p>
  <h3>Hokusai</h3>
  <p>Katsushika Hokusai was a Japanese artist who lived in the 18th and 19th centuries and is widely regarded as one of Japan's greatest artists. Hokusai's most famous work is The Great Wave off Kanagawa, a woodblock print that portrays a powerful wave about to crash over boats in the ocean.</p>
