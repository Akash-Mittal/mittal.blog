   <p>War never brings anything good. But the origin of every war differs. In the year 2022, the world witnessed the Russia-Ukraine War, which has been regarded as a significant incident of the 21st century. The war broke out after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The event attracted several strong responses from different countries. Firstly, the Western democracies such as Canada, the United States, and countries of the European Union showed their stance by condemning Russia's actions and imposing sanctions on the country. On the other hand, Switzerland and India chose a neutral position, which calls for deeper reflection and analysis.</p>
   <h2>Switzerland's neutral position</h2>
   <p>Switzerland is one of the few countries in the world that follows a strict neutrality policy. Therefore, it chose not to issue any sanctions against Russia and maintained economic relations that cater to the best interests of the country. Switzerland follows the traditional form of non-alignment, which implies that the country refrains from participating in regional and international conflicts.</p>
   <p>Switzerland's neutral position aids in protecting the country's long-term interests by promoting its image as an impartial and peaceful country. The country is known for its stability, neutrality, and expertise in conflict management. Such values increase the country's prestige, which is significant for its economic development and foreign relations.</p>
   <p>Additionally, Switzerland's neutrality serves as an asset in mediating conflicts between other countries. The Swiss government has acted as a mediator in various international conflicts such as between Russia and Georgia, North and South Korea, and the United States and Iran. The country rightly so perceives that participating in the Russia-Ukraine war would not serve any positive effect and could act as a hindrance in any future peacekeeping efforts.</p>
   <h2>India's neutral position</h2>
   <p>India, as a strong and significant power in the world, also chose a neutral approach. India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, called for a peaceful resolution of the conflict and emphasized the importance of diplomacy. India's stance was different than steps that some Western countries took, such as expelling Russian diplomats and imposing sanctions.</p>
   <p>The country's neutral position aims to serve its long-term national interests and economic activities. India has thriving economic relations with Russia, which, if severed, could lead to adverse economic effects for the country. Additionally, India also has a complex relationship with Ukraine, which requires a cautious and articulated approach.</p>
   <p>India's non-aligned foreign policy, adopted after independence in 1947, mirrors Switzerland's non-alignment policy. India believes in staying neutral in international conflicts and works towards bringing peace through diplomatic channels. India's neutral stance aligns with its principles of helping to create a multi-polar world where nations do not impose their will on others.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>Switzerland and India choosing a neutral approach towards the Russia-Ukraine war demonstrate their commitment to promoting long-term interests, economic growth and stability, and peaceful conflict management. Their stance is rooted in their traditional foreign policies, which emphasize neutrality, non-alignment, and mediation in conflicts. Such policies help them maintain a commitment to peace and stability while avoiding repercussions that could arise from being involved in an international conflict.</p>
   <p>Thus, it takes courage to stand neutral in international conflicts and prioritize peace over retaliation or choosing sides. The cases of Switzerland and India reveal that the neutral stance has practical and strategic implications, leading to renewed respect globally for these countries.</p>
