  <p>As Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi lands in the United States for his upcoming visit, he is expected to receive a rockstar welcome from the Indian diaspora. But what role does the Indian diaspora play in Indian politics?</p>
  
  <p>The power of the Indian diaspora in politics was demonstrated in the 2014 Indian General Elections, when Narendra Modi was elected as the Prime Minister of India. The diaspora played a crucial role in Modi's election campaign, with millions of Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) across the world actively campaigning for him.</p>
  <p>In fact, Modi's first visit to the United States as Prime Minister was largely focused on the Indian diaspora. He addressed a large gathering of NRIs at the Madison Square Garden in New York City, where he received a thunderous applause. This visit helped Modi solidify his image as a global leader, while strengthening his ties with the Indian diaspora.</p>
  <h2>Examples and Case Studies</h2>
  <p>The Indian diaspora is estimated to be around 30 million, with the largest populations residing in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Over the years, the Indian diaspora has become an integral part of the global economy, with NRIs contributing significantly to the Indian economy through remittances. However, their impact on Indian politics cannot be ignored.</p>
  <p>In the 2019 Indian General Elections, the Indian diaspora once again played a significant role. NRIs were allowed to vote in the Indian elections for the first time, with the Indian government allowing them to cast their votes at Indian missions abroad. This move was widely appreciated by the diaspora and helped strengthen their ties with India.</p>
  <p>Moreover, political parties in India have also recognized the importance of the diaspora. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has actively courted the diaspora, with Modi himself addressing numerous gatherings of NRIs in the United States, Canada, and other countries. The opposition parties have also followed suit, with Congress President Rahul Gandhi holding meetings with the Indian diaspora during his visits abroad.</p>
  <p>However, the question remains â€“ how much of an impact does the diaspora actually have on Indian politics? It is difficult to measure the diaspora's impact, as the diaspora itself is not a homogenous entity and consists of people with varied political views. While the diaspora does play a crucial role in spreading awareness and shaping perceptions, it is unclear whether this translates into votes.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, the Indian diaspora plays a significant role in Indian politics. Their impact can be seen in the way political parties are engaging with the diaspora, and in the way the diaspora is shaping perceptions about India. However, it is unclear whether the diaspora's impact translates into votes, or whether it is a significant factor in determining the outcome of Indian elections. Nevertheless, the Indian diaspora is a powerful force that cannot be ignored, and is likely to play an even greater role in shaping India's future.</p>
