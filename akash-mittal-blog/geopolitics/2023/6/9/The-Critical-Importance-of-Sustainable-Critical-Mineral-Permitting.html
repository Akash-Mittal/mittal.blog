  <h1>The Critical Importance of Sustainable Critical Mineral Permitting</h1></br> <img src="images/The-Critical-Importance-of-Sustainable-Critical-Mineral-Permitting.jpeg" alt="+The-Critical-Importance-of-Sustainable-Critical-Mineral-Permitting+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://source.benchmarkminerals.com/article/manchin-says-major-strides-made-in-critical-mineral-permitting-after-debt-limit-deal" target="_blank" href="https://source.benchmarkminerals.com/article/manchin-says-major-strides-made-in-critical-mineral-permitting-after-debt-limit-deal" rel="noopener">https://source.benchmarkminerals.com/article/manchin-says-major-strides-made-in-critical-mineral-permitting-after-debt-limit-deal</a></span></h5>
  <p>A few decades ago, the idea that we would be dependent on technologies like smartphones and electric cars to get through our daily lives would have been unimaginable. However, in the current era, these technologies are integral parts of our lives, and their importance is only set to increase in the future. Nevertheless, the very same critical minerals that power these technologies are also a cause of significant ecological concern.</p>
  <p>Extracting these minerals has significant environmental impact, so it is crucial that the mining industry works to reduce their carbon footprint and ensures sustainable practices. However, there is also a need to provide permits for mining companies to extract these minerals safely and efficiently. One such initiative is Senator Joe Manchin's recent comments on improving critical mineral permitting, which could lead to a more sustainable future.</p>
  <h2>The Current State of Critical Mineral Permitting</h2>
  <p>Permitting for critical mineral projects has been a challenging issue for mining companies due to the commitments it entails to the environment. Extraction sites could impact habitat areas, thus posing a potential threat to the fauna and flora of an area. However, the recent debt limit deal agreed upon in Congress could pave the way for improvements in the process.</p>
  <p>In a speech given at the Benchmark Gigafactories USA conference, Senator Joe Manchin expressed his views on the current state of critical mineral permitting. Manchin commended the "major strides" made in terms of improving the permitting process of critical minerals projects post the debt ceiling deal agreed in Congress this month.</p>
  <p>He further emphasized the need for the environmental community to come to grips with the reality of the situation. It is essential to do so because while everyone wants to use smartphones or electric cars, environmental sustainability is just as important as their daily usage.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies on Sustainable Critical Mineral Permitting</h2>
  <p>Several companies are adopting sustainable practices, and there are multiple case studies on how they are practicing sustainable critical mineral mining. Following are three such examples:</p>
  <h3>1. Tesla</h3>
  <p>The electric car manufacturing giant Tesla is committed to sustainable mining practices. The company stated in its 2020 Impact Report that it is "working to reduce copper, rare earth, and cobalt usage in our vehicles." They announced plans to manufacture their batteries, and mostly use recycled materials to create them. Also, Tesla is already exploring novel battery designs that use less cobalt, as the majority of the world's cobalt is still extracted using unethical methods.</p>
  <h3>2. Rio Tinto</h3>
  <p>Mining company Rio Tinto is implementing transparent and sustainable practices. The company recently signed a power purchase agreement with a solar project to reduce carbon emissions at the company's Boron mine in California. Rio Tinto aims to produce materials needed for advanced manufacturing techniques, including electric vehicles, that are following sustainable mining principles. The company's target is to operate with net-zero emissions by 2050.</p>
  <h3>3. DeepGreen Metals</h3>
  <p>DeepGreen Metals aims to eliminate the need for primary mining entirely. DeepGreen Minerals, a Canadian company developing the world's largest and first battery-grade nickel-cobalt production by using polymetallic nodules. These nodules can be found deep down in the ocean, containing large quantities of valuable metals and elements necessary for the tech industry. By using these nodules, DeepGreen Metals hopes to reduce the impact of primary mining on the environment significantly.</p>
  <h2>The Need for Sustainable Critical Mineral Permitting</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, the mining industry needs to focus on making critical mineral extraction sustainable and reduce their ecological impact. To do so, mining approval agencies such as the government must provide permits to mining companies by ensuring that the environmental impact is kept to a minimum. Democratic Senator Joe Manchin's commitment to improving the critical mineral permit process will be undoubtedly beneficial in ensuring that the technology that we depend on does not come at the cost of environmental degradation.</p>
  <p>Companies have developed innovative techniques to reduce their ecological impact, and the government agencies approving permits have to keep up with the sustainable innovation. The need to encourage sustainable production practices is not just limited to the mining industry, and it extends to all industries. Sustainable critical mineral extraction should be seen as an essential part of reducing the carbon footprint of all industries and building a sustainable future.</p><!-- Reference URLs and Hashtags:
