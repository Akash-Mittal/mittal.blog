  <p>When it comes to global politics, alliances and relationships are constantly in flux. The latest poll from the European Council on Foreign Relations shows the change in attitudes of Europeans towards the USA, China and Russia. The poll reflected a significant shift in Europe's perceptions towards these three global superpowers, indicating who Europe views as their friends and who they consider as their foes.</p>
  <h2>Europe's attitude towards the USA</h2>
  <p>Europe's views of the USA have changed significantly under the Trump presidency. The USA is no longer viewed as Europe's closest ally, with only 23% of Europeans believing that the US can be relied on as a partner. This is compared to 60% in 2014. Instead, under Trump's leadership, many Europeans have become disillusioned with the USA and its international policies.</p>
  <p>For example, Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement and the Iran Nuclear Deal was met with criticism from Europe. In particular, European leaders have expressed disappointment with the US's lack of action on climate change, which poses a significant threat to the future of the planet.</p>
  <h2>Europe's attitude towards China</h2>
  <p>China's growing economic and political power has also been a concern for many Europeans. However, the poll found that European attitudes towards China have remained relatively stable, with 37% of Europeans seeing China as a partner.</p>
  <p>China's increasing involvement in European economies, such as its purchase of ports in Greece and Italy, has raised concerns about China's potential influence in Europe. However, China has also been a significant investor in European technology and infrastructure.</p>
  <p>At the same time, concerns about China's human rights record and its controversial Belt and Road Initiative have led to some skepticism among Europeans.</p>
  <h2>Europe's attitude towards Russia</h2>
  <p>In recent years, relations between Europe and Russia have deteriorated significantly. The poll found that only 7% of Europeans see Russia as a partner.</p>
  <p>The deterioration in relations can be attributed to Russia's actions in Ukraine, its interference in the US presidential election, and its involvement in the Syria conflict.</p>
  <p>In addition, the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in the UK and the subsequent expulsion of Russian diplomats from European countries has also contributed to the worsening relationship between Europe and Russia.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The poll from the European Council on Foreign Relations indicates that Europe's attitudes towards the USA, China and Russia are continuously evolving, based on a variety of political, economic and social factors.</p>
  <p>Europeans' declining confidence in the USA and Russia can be attributed to the decision-making of their leaders, while their stable attitude towards China suggests that Europeans recognize the importance of the country's economic influence despite concerns with its political system and human rights record.</p>
  <p>Ultimately, the poll reflects a complex and ever-changing landscape of global political alliances and relationships, highlighting the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for Europe and its international partners.</p>
