  <p>In April 2016, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Saudi Arabia, where he was welcomed by a group of 30,000 Indians living in the country. They lined up the streets and held placards with messages of support for their beloved leader. The event was a testament to the influence of Indian diaspora in the global political arena.</p>
  <p>The Indian diaspora, which comprises of over 31 million people living in different parts of the world, has always played a significant role in Indian politics. From funding political campaigns to lobbying for policy changes, the diaspora has been an active participant in shaping the political landscape of India. This article will explore the impact of Indian diaspora on Indian politics, with examples and case studies, and conclude with three key takeaways.</p>
  <h2>The Political Influence of Indian Diaspora: Examples and Case Studies</h2>
  <h3>1. Funding Political Campaigns</h3>
  <p>The Indian diaspora, especially those living in the United States and the United Kingdom, has been instrumental in funding political campaigns of Indian politicians. In the 2014 Indian general elections, Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) received substantial donations from Indian Americans. According to a report by the Hindu American Foundation, around 50% of Indian Americans who donated to political campaigns in 2014, donated to the BJP. Similarly, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, several Indian Americans came forward to support Modi's campaign, raising over $5 million in donations.</p>
  <h3>2. Lobbying for Policy Changes</h3>
  <p>The Indian diaspora has also been active in lobbying for policy changes in India. For instance, the Non-Resident Indian (NRI) community played a crucial role in the passing of the Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) scheme, which allows people of Indian origin to travel to India without a visa and stay there indefinitely. Similarly, several Indian Americans have been advocating for the India-U.S. nuclear deal and the H-1B visa policy, which affects a large number of Indian professionals working in the United States.</p>
  <h3>3. Supporting Political Parties and Candidates</h3>
  <p>The Indian diaspora has also been known to support political parties and candidates in India. For instance, in the 2017 Punjab assembly elections, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) received substantial support from the diaspora. The party's convenor in Punjab at that time, Gurpreet Singh Waraich, remarked, "The NRIs (Non-Resident Indians) are putting their money and their heart into the elections. They are setting an example for others to follow." Similarly, several members of the Indian American community came forward to support the candidacy of Kamala Harris, who is of Indian descent, in the U.S. presidential elections.</p>
  <h2>Takeaways</h2>
  <p>Based on the examples and case studies presented, it is clear that the Indian diaspora plays a significant role in Indian politics. Here are three key takeaways:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The Indian diaspora is a valuable source of funding for political campaigns, and their contributions can make a substantial impact on the outcome of elections.</li>
   <li>The diaspora can influence policy changes in India by advocating for issues that affect them and their communities.</li>
   <li>The diaspora's support for political parties and candidates can sway public opinion and make a difference in their electoral success.</li>
  </ul>
