   <p>One of the hallmarks of press freedom is the ability of journalists to report on stories without fear of persecution or harassment. However, this is not always the case in some countries. For instance, China and India, two of the world's oldest civilizations, have very different approaches to media freedom. While India is considered one of the freest countries in the world when it comes to press freedom, China is often ranked very low, sometimes at the bottom of the list.</p>
   <h2>Examples with Case Studies</h2>
   <h3>India</h3>
   <p>In India, journalists are generally free to cover any story they wish, and there is a lively and diverse media ecosystem. However, that does not mean that they don't face challenges. For example, in 2020, several journalists who reported on sensitive topics were attacked or harassed by police officials. In one case, journalist Prashant Kanojia was arrested and charged with sedition after he posted a tweet critical of the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister. This led to widespread condemnation from the media fraternity and civil society, and he was eventually released on bail.</p>
   <h3>China</h3>
   <p>China, on the other hand, has a very different approach to media freedom. The government controls all media, and it is illegal for journalists to report on sensitive topics without official approval. As a result, many journalists who report on sensitive topics, such as human rights abuses or corruption, are often harassed, arrested, or imprisoned. In its latest press freedom index, Reporters Without Borders ranked China 179th out of 180 countries and described it as the world's biggest jailer of journalists, with 100 currently behind bars.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion in 3 points</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>India has a free press, with journalists generally free to report on any story they want, subject to certain restrictions.</li>
    <li>China has a highly controlled media environment where journalists are subject to censorship, harassment, and imprisonment for reporting on sensitive topics.</li>
    <li>Both India and China can learn from each other when it comes to media freedom. India can learn from China's ability to control the spread of 'fake news,' whereas China can learn from India's more open approach to reporting on a wide range of topics.</li>
   </ul>
