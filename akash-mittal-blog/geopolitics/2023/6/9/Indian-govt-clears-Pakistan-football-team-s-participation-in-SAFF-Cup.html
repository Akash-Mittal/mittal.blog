   <p>Sports have always been a source of unity and harmony among nations. It not only promotes healthy competition but also helps in building strong ties between countries. However, politics often plays a bigger role than sports, leading to bitterness and division.</p>
   <p>In recent times, India and Pakistan have not been on good terms, with disputes over territory and terrorism creating tensions. Sports have not been immune to this, with several incidents of political tensions disrupting sporting events between the two countries.</p>
   <p>One such incident happened during the 2019 SAFF Cup, where India and Pakistan were scheduled to play against each other. However, due to political tensions, the match was postponed indefinitely.</p>
   <section>
    <h3>Case Studies</h3>
    <p>Let us take a look at some of the incidents where politics affected sports between India and Pakistan:</p>
    <h4>1. 2016 Kabaddi World Cup</h4>
    <p>The 2016 Kabaddi World Cup was organized in India, with Pakistan being one of the participating nations. However, due to tensions between the two countries, the Pakistan team was not given clearance to participate in the tournament. This move by the Indian government was criticized by several international bodies and the Pakistan Olympic Association, who labeled it as discrimination.</p>
    <h4>2. 2019 Cricket World Cup</h4>
    <p>The highly anticipated match between India and Pakistan during the 2019 Cricket World Cup was clouded by the tensions between the two countries. There were several calls for boycotts and protests, with some even demanding that the Indian team forfeit the match. However, the match went ahead as planned, with India emerging as the winners.</p>
    <h4>3. 2021 Tokyo Olympics</h4>
    <p>Pakistan's shooters were not allowed to enter India for the 2021 Tokyo Olympics qualifications due to the ongoing tensions between the two countries. They eventually had to travel to Egypt to participate in the event, with limited time to practice and acclimatize.</p>
   </section>
   <p>However, with the recent clearance given by the Indian government for Pakistan's football team to participate in the SAFF Cup, there is hope for a new era of sports diplomacy between the two nations.</p>
   <p>The Secretary of the All India Football Federation (AIFF), Kushal Das, confirmed that the Indian government has given clearance for the Pakistan football team to travel to Maldives for the SAFF Cup. The tournament is scheduled to start from October 1, 2021.</p>
   <p>This decision has been hailed by several sports bodies and fans across the globe as a positive step towards building better relations between India and Pakistan. It is also a great opportunity for both teams to showcase their talent and compete at the highest level in the South Asian region.</p>
   <section>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>In conclusion, sports have always been a unifying force, and it is heartening to see that politics did not get in the way of Pakistan's participation in the SAFF Cup. This move by the Indian government shows that sports diplomacy can go a long way in building better relations between nations, and we hope to see more such initiatives in the future. In the end, it is the spirit of the game that matters, and we should focus on that rather than letting politics divide us.</p>
