   <p class="lead">The cricket bat used by Travis Head in the World Test Championship final between Australia and New Zealand has gone viral, with fans from India and Pakistan bickering over its origins.</p>
   <p>Travis Head scored a brilliant 163 runs in the final of the inaugural World Test Championship, leading Australia to a comfortable victory over New Zealand. However, it was not just his batting that caught the eye of cricket fans around the world. The bat he used to score those runs has become a topic of debate and discussion among Indian and Pakistani cricket fans.</p>
   <h2>The Backstory</h2>
   <p>Travis Head's bat was manufactured by an Australian company named Kookaburra. The company has been producing high-quality cricket equipment for over a hundred years and is trusted by many international cricket players.</p>
   <p>After Travis Head's outstanding performance in the World Test Championship final, a video of his bat went viral on social media. The video showed the Kookaburra logo on the bat, which was enough for Indian and Pakistani cricket fans to start arguing about its origin.</p>
   <p>Some Indian fans claimed that the bat was made in India and that it was only branded by Kookaburra. Pakistani fans, on the other hand, believed that the bat was made in Pakistan and then branded by Kookaburra. There were heated arguments on social media, with each side trying to prove their point.</p>
   <h2>The Truth About the Bat</h2>
   <p>The truth is that while Kookaburra is an Australian company, they do not manufacture their bats in Australia. In fact, their bats are manufactured in India and Pakistan. Kookaburra has factories in both countries, where skilled workers produce their high-quality cricket equipment.</p>
   <p>However, the confusion among fans is understandable. In the modern-day world of globalisation, the manufacturing process of a product is not always clear. Brands often outsource their production to different countries, and it can be difficult to know where a product was made just by looking at its logo.</p>
   <h2>The Importance of Trustworthy Brands in Cricket</h2>
   <p>The debate around Travis Head's bat may seem trivial, but it highlights the importance of trustworthy brands in the world of cricket. Cricket is a sport that demands the highest level of skill and equipment. Players need to trust their equipment in order to perform at their best.</p>
   <p>Brands like Kookaburra have built a reputation over a hundred years of producing high-quality cricket equipment. They have gained the trust of international cricket players and fans alike. This trust is important, as it allows players to focus on their game, rather than worrying about the quality of their equipment.</p>
   <h2>The Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The debate between Indian and Pakistani fans regarding Travis Head's bat is a testament to the passion that cricket fans have for the sport. It also highlights the importance of trustworthy brands in cricket. While the manufacturing process of a product may not always be clear, the reputation that a brand has built over the years speaks volumes about the quality of its products.</p>
