  <h1>The Polarizing Presidency of Ferdinand Marcos Jr.: A Year in Review</h1></br> <img src="images/The-Polarizing-Presidency-of-Ferdinand-Marcos-Jr-A-Year-in-Review.jpeg" alt="+The-Polarizing-Presidency-of-Ferdinand-Marcos-Jr-A-Year-in-Review+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://international.thenewslens.com/article/186149" target="_blank" href="https://international.thenewslens.com/article/186149" rel="noopener">https://international.thenewslens.com/article/186149</a></span></h5>
  <p>When Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr. was sworn in as Vice President of the Philippines in June 2016, many saw it as a return to the family dynasty that ruled the country with an iron grip for two decades. Marcos, the son of former President Ferdinand Marcos Sr. and former First Lady Imelda Marcos, had a controversial political career that included accusations of human rights abuses and massive corruption.</p>
  <p>But despite these controversies, Marcos remains a popular figure in the Philippines, with a recent poll indicating that 78% of Filipinos approve of his performance. However, analysts remain divided on his achievements and the impact of his policies on the lives of ordinary Filipinos. In this article, we will examine the first year of Marcos's presidency, looking at case studies and expert analysis to provide a balanced view of his record.</p>
  <h2>The Promise of Change: Marcos's Campaign Platform</h2>
  <p>During his campaign, Marcos promised to continue the reforms begun by the outgoing administration of Benigno Aquino III, with a focus on strengthening the economy, creating jobs, and improving infrastructure. He also pledged to address the root causes of poverty, such as corruption and inadequate education and healthcare.</p>
  <p>One of Marcos's first acts as President was the signing of Executive Order No. 1, which established the Presidential Anti-Corruption Commission. The commission was tasked with investigating and prosecuting corrupt officials, and was seen as a positive step towards fulfilling Marcos's promise to tackle corruption.</p>
  <h2>Mixed Results: The Marcos Presidency in Action</h2>
  <p>However, despite these early promises, Marcos's first year in office has been marked by mixed results. Some of his initiatives have been praised by experts and beneficiaries, while others have faced criticism and opposition.</p>
  <h3>Positive Developments</h3>
  <p>One of Marcos's biggest accomplishments in his first year was the passage of the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act, which provides free tuition to all students in public universities and colleges. The law, which was signed in August 2017, is expected to benefit millions of Filipino students and help address the challenges of poverty and inequality.</p>
  <p>Another notable success for Marcos was his administration's response to the Marawi siege, a five-month conflict between government forces and Islamic State-affiliated militants that devastated the city of Marawi in Mindanao. Marcos led efforts to rebuild the city and provide assistance to its residents, earning praise for his leadership during the crisis.</p>
  <h3>Controversial Policies</h3>
  <p>However, Marcos's administration has also faced criticism for its handling of other issues, such as the drug war, which has been blamed for thousands of extrajudicial killings and human rights abuses. Marcos has defended the campaign as necessary to combat the country's drug problem, but critics say that it has disproportionately targeted poor and marginalized communities.</p>
  <p>Similarly, Marcos's plan to shift to a federal form of government has been met with opposition from some experts, who argue that it could lead to further balkanization and exacerbate regional and ethnic tensions. Critics also say that the proposed shift could result in greater inequality and corruption, particularly in poorer regions.</p>
  <h2>The Verdict: Expert Analysis and Public Opinion</h2>
  <p>When it comes to evaluating Marcos's record, experts and ordinary Filipinos remain divided. While some analysts have praised his achievements, others say that he has yet to deliver on his promises and address the underlying issues of poverty and corruption.</p>
  <p>According to Cleve Arguelles of WR Numero Research, "we have really yet to see any major achievements, especially for the lives of the ordinary people." However, other experts have pointed to the positive developments under Marcos's administration, such as the push for infrastructure development and the successful handling of the Marawi crisis.</p>
  <p>Ultimately, the verdict on Marcos's presidency will depend on the outcomes of his policies and initiatives in the years to come. Will he be remembered as a transformative leader who brought real change to the Philippines, or as a controversial figure who failed to live up to his promises? Only time will tell.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion: The Legacy of Marcos's Presidency in Three Points</h2>
  <p>As we look back on the first year of Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s presidency, several key themes emerge:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Mixed results: While Marcos's administration has achieved some significant successes, it has also faced criticism for its controversial policies and initiatives.</li>
   <li>Public opinion: Despite these controversies, Marcos remains a popular figure among Filipinos, with a majority approving of his performance in office.</li>
   <li>The future: The long-term impact of Marcos's presidency will depend on the outcomes of his policies, as well as the verdict of history on his controversial family legacy.</li>
