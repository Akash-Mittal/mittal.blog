  <p>Once upon a time, the Indian rupee was known for its volatility in the global currency market. However, in recent times, the Indian currency has been relatively stable despite the challenging economic conditions. In this article, we will explore how the Indian rupee has managed to maintain its stability, despite the global economic challenges.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Indian Rupee's Stability</h2>
  <p>One example of the Indian rupee's stability is during India's recent financial year from April 2020 to March 2021. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the global economy, India witnessed a current account surplus of $19.8 billion. This surplus was due to high foreign exchange inflows, fueled by the Indian government's focus on foreign investment, such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme.</p>
  <p>Another illustration of the Indian rupee's stability is its performance compared to other emerging market currencies. For instance, the Brazilian real and the Turkish lira witnessed sharp depreciation during the same period. In contrast, the Indian rupee remained stable or marginally appreciated, portraying the continued foreign fund inflows in the current financial year.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies of the Indian Rupee's Stability</h2>
  <p>One notable event that tested the Indian rupee's strength was the COVID-19 lockdown in March 2020, which triggered a sharp depreciation in the currency. However, the Indian government introduced several policy measures to support the economy and cushion the currency's fall. For instance, the government introduced the 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' package, which boosted domestic manufacturing, promoting exports and reducing import dependence. These measures helped to stabilize the Indian rupee from its sharp descent seen in March 2020.</p>
  <p>In addition, the Indian rupee's stability can be attributed to the proactive measures taken by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The RBI has been keeping a steady policy outlook, maintaining an accommodative stance even amidst the inflationary pressure. The RBI has also ensured adequate forex reserves, which have skyrocketed to more than $600 billion by May 2021 from $500 billion at the beginning of 2020. This move ensures India's import cover to be more than a year and has helped stabilize the currency.</p>
