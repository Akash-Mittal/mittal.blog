   <p>History is filled with instances where countries have come together to solve a global crisis. One such instance was the formation of Group of Twenty (G20) in 1999 in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis.</p>
   <p>The G20 is a forum bringing together the leaders and finance ministers of the world's largest economies, as well as the European Union. Representing around 80% of global GDP, the G20 countries have an immense amount of power and influence when it comes to making decisions that affect the global economy.</p>
   <h2>The role of G20 in times of global crises</h2>
   <p>The G20 has been instrumental in managing global crises, influencing international policy, and fostering economic growth. Below are some examples of how the forum has provided leadership during challenging times.</p>
   <h3>1. The G20's response to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC)</h3>
   <p>The G20 played a key role in managing the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008-09. At the height of the crisis, G20 leaders met on multiple occasions to coordinate their fiscal and monetary policies and avoid a global depression.</p>
   <p>By creating a coordinated global response, the G20 led the way in helping economies recover from the GFC. The forum also led to the creation of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), which monitors and assesses global economic and financial risks.</p>
   <h3>2. Addressing climate change and promoting sustainable development</h3>
   <p>The G20 has recognized the importance of addressing climate change and promoting sustainable development. In 2015, the G20 committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and also set targets to increase the use of renewable energy sources.</p>
   <p>The forum has also recognized the significance of investing in sustainable infrastructure, which is critical to promoting inclusive economic growth. By working together, G20 countries have been able to leverage their collective influence to promote sustainable development.</p>
   <h3>3. Collaborating to address the COVID-19 pandemic</h3>
   <p>The COVID-19 pandemic presented a significant challenge to the global economy. The G20's response has been swift, coordinated, and remarkably effective. The leaders' meeting of March 2020 drew up a comprehensive plan of action, including the deployment of resources to contain the virus and mitigate the economic fallout.</p>
   <p>The G20 has also supported the global effort to develop and distribute vaccines, recognizing that true progress in defeating the pandemic would require global cooperation.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The G20 has emerged as a key player in shaping global economic policy. By bringing together the leaders of the world's largest economies, the G20 has been able to coordinate policy, manage crises, and promote sustainable development.</p>
   <p>As India takes the baton as president of the G20 in 2023, it will have an opportunity to play a critical role in shaping the direction of the global economy. This will require leveraging India's strengths in areas such as technology and manufacturing to drive economic growth while promoting sustainable development.</p>
