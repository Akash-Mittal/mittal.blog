   <p>As the world moves towards environmentally conscious practices, electric cars have become increasingly popular. This has led to a surge in demand for components such as batteries. However, concerns regarding Chinese involvement in the battery supply chain have prompted the US government to introduce a new law that has left automakers in a dilemma.</p>
   <h2>The $7,500 Electric Vehicle Tax Credit</h2>
   <p>Starting January next year, access to the $7,500 consumer electric vehicle tax credit in the US Inflation Reduction Act will be withdrawn if any "foreign entities of concern" are involved in the production of the battery components. However, an exact definition for an entity of concern has yet to be given. This uncertainty is making automakers anxious as major battery producers such as China's CATL and BYD could be classified as such.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <h3>Tesla</h3>
   <p>Tesla, which is a US based company, sources some of its batteries from Chinese suppliers. This leaves the company in a tight spot as it will lose the tax credit if its suppliers are deemed "entities of concern." This could lead to a significant increase in the price of Tesla's electric vehicles, putting them at a disadvantage in the market when compared to other EVs.</p>
   <h3>General Motors</h3>
   <p>General Motors faces a similar issue. The company has announced its ambitious plans to transition to an all-electric fleet by 2035, and a significant share of its future EVs will be powered by batteries manufactured by LG Chem, a Korean company with operations in China. If LG Chem is deemed an entity of concern, General Motors will lose access to the tax credit.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Automakers need clarity from the US government on the definition of "entities of concern" to be able to plan and strategize their production and procurement processes.</li>
    <li>The lack of clarity is making automakers anxious, and this could impact their EV sales and shift the momentum to other countries leading the race in the EV market.</li>
    <li>The US needs to incentivize battery production in the country, creating job opportunities and encouraging manufacturers to relocate their operations to the US, thereby reducing its reliance on China and other countries in the battery supply chain.</li>
   </ol>
