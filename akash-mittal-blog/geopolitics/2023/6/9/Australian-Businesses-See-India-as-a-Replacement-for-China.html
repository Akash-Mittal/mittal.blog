    <p>Once upon a time, Australian businesses relied heavily on China as their main trading partner. However, the Covid pandemic showed how dangerous it can be to put all your eggs in one basket. Suddenly, these businesses found themselves struggling as China shut down its borders and limited imports. As a result, many Australian businesses are now looking to India as a replacement or an evener for their exports and imports.</p>
