   <p>Smartphone maker Xiaomi has been in the news lately, but not for the right reasons. Recently, India's financial-crime agency issued a show-cause notice to Xiaomi's India unit, its officials, and three banks over the company's alleged illegal remittances to foreign entities.</p>
   <p>According to the investigation, Xiaomi India sent about $1.3 billion to seven companies, out of which three were found to be subsidiaries of the Chinese firm. The remaining four companies were reportedly shell firms that had no actual business activities and were registered in tax havens. The money was allegedly sent without obtaining the necessary approvals from the Reserve Bank of India.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <h3>1. Apple vs EU</h3>
   <p>The Xiaomi case is not the first instance of a big tech company getting into trouble over taxation and remittances. Earlier, Apple had run into trouble with the European Union over its Irish tax arrangements. The EU had accused Apple of receiving illegal state aid amounting to $14.5 billion by paying a lower rate of tax than other businesses in Ireland. The company had to pay back the amount in taxes along with interest.</p>
   <h3>2. Google vs France</h3>
   <p>Similarly, Google had to pay a fine of €500 million to the French government for tax evasion. The amount includes a penalty of €465 million and an additional tax adjustment of €55 million. Google had allegedly under-reported its profits in France by booking them in Ireland, where the tax rate was lower. This was done by establishing a subsidiary in Ireland that did not employ any workers.</p>
   <h3>3. Facebook vs Australia</h3>
   <p>In another instance, Facebook had to pay back taxes of AUD 31 million (approx. $22 million) to the Australian government. The social media giant was accused of diverting profits offshore and underestimating its revenue in Australia. The company had faced similar allegations in Europe as well, where it was accused of under-reporting its profits by shifting them to subsidiaries in low-tax countries.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>These cases show that big tech companies often indulge in tax evasion and illegal remittances to save millions of dollars. However, governments are becoming increasingly vigilant about such practices and are taking strict action against companies found guilty of these offences. Xiaomi India is likely to face penalties if it is found guilty of illegally remitting funds to foreign entities. It is essential for tech companies to follow the legal and ethical standards set by the authorities to prevent such issues from arising in the future.</p>
