  <p>India has always dreamt of uniting all its territories under one flag and creating a great nation called 'Akhand Bharat' or 'United India'. However, that dream seems to be shattered now, as three of India's neighbours, Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh, have objected to the mural depicting 'Akhand Bharat' in the new parliament building.</p>
  <p>The Indian Government has clarified that the map is of the ancient Ashokan Empire. The accompanying Ashokan rock edict is from Maski in Raichur, and the sculpture of Ashoka from Sannati in Kalburgi, both in India. But the objections from the neighbouring countries highlight a deeper issue - the failure of India to unite its neighbouring countries under one umbrella.</p>
  <h2>The Story of Akhand Bharat</h2>
  <p>The idea of Akhand Bharat was first proposed by Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, a freedom fighter and member of the Hindu Mahasabha. Savarkar believed that India was once a great civilisation that stretched from Afghanistan in the west to Myanmar in the east and from Tibet in the north to Sri Lanka in the south. He thought that India had been disintegrated by foreign invaders like Alexander, the Mughals, and the British. Savarkar proposed the idea of uniting all territories that were once part of India under one flag and creating a great nation that would be Hindu-dominated.</p>
  <p>Savarkar's idea of Akhand Bharat found resonance with the Hindu nationalists and gave birth to the RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) and its political wing, the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party). The RSS and the BJP have always championed the cause of Akhand Bharat and have tried to unite all territories that were once part of India under one flag.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies of India's Failed Attempts at Akhand Bharat</h2>
  <h3>Kashmir</h3>
  <p>Kashmir is a disputed territory between India, Pakistan, and China. India claims that the entire territory of Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India, while Pakistan claims the territory of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan as part of Pakistan. China has occupied the Aksai Chin region of Kashmir. India has tried to integrate Kashmir into its territory by abrogating Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, but the move has been severely criticised by Pakistan and other international bodies.</p>
  <h3>Nepal</h3>
  <p>Nepal was once a vassal state of India, but it gained independence in 1951. India shares a long border with Nepal, and the Nepalese people have close cultural ties with India. However, in recent years, Nepal has been shifting closer to China, as India has been accused of interfering in Nepal's internal affairs and imposing an economic blockade on Nepal in 2015.</p>
  <h3>Bangladesh</h3>
  <p>Bangladesh was part of Pakistan until it gained independence in 1971. However, India played a pivotal role in the liberation of Bangladesh by providing military and political support to the freedom fighters of Bangladesh. Despite this, India's relations with Bangladesh have been strained in recent years due to the issue of illegal immigration from Bangladesh to India.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The idea of Akhand Bharat may seem like a noble dream, but it has failed to take into account the aspirations and identities of India's neighbouring countries. The Hindu nationalist ideology that underpins Akhand Bharat may have worked in the past, but it is not a viable solution in today's world, where pluralism and diversity are valued. India needs to find a new way of engaging with its neighbouring countries and building a relationship based on trust and mutual respect.</p>
