   <h2>The Battle Behind Travis Head's Cricket Bat</h2>
   <p>Travis Head is a name well-known in the world of cricket. He is an Australian cricketer who has represented his country in international cricket across all three formats. However, his bat has sparked a controversy between India and Pakistan. During the recent ICC World Test Championship Final between India and New Zealand, Travis Head played an amazing knock with an attractive cricket bat that caught the attention of many keen-eyed Pakistan cricket fans, who immediately noticed that the bat looked familiar.</p>
   <p>Head's bat was a Gray-Nicolls, the same brand previously used by Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar, which has been popular in the subcontinent for many years. As soon as the similarity between Tendulkar's bat and Head's bat was noticed, it sparked a heated debate on social media that soon spilled over to cricketing forums around the world.</p>
