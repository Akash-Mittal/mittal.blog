  <h1>Death in the Mosque: Afghanistan Mosque Attack by ISIS-K (Taliban)</h1></br> <img src="images/Afghanistan-Mosque-Attack-by-ISIS-K.jpeg" alt="+Afghanistan-Mosque-Attack-by-ISIS-K+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://moderntokyotimes.com/afghanistan-mosque-attack-by-isis-k-taliban/" target="_blank" href="https://moderntokyotimes.com/afghanistan-mosque-attack-by-isis-k-taliban/" rel="noopener">https://moderntokyotimes.com/afghanistan-mosque-attack-by-isis-k-taliban/</a></span></h5>
  <p>It was a holy day for Muslims in Afghanistan, and they were gathered in a mosque to offer their prayers. But what happened there was far from holy. On Tuesday, October 12, ISIS-K (Taliban) carried out a deadly attack on a Shia mosque in the southern city of Kandahar.</p>
  <p>The attack killed at least 47 people and injured dozens more. ISIS-K claimed responsibility for the attack, making it one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Afghanistan this year. The attack comes during a fragile time for Afghanistan, as the Taliban has taken control of much of the country following the withdrawal of American troops.</p>
  <h2>The Rising Threat of Terrorism in Afghanistan</h2>
  <p>The mosque attack in Kandahar is just one among several recent incidents of terrorism in Afghanistan. The country has been grappling with terrorism for decades, but the recent rise of ISIS-K and the Taliban has made the situation even worse.</p>
  <p>The Taliban, a hardline Islamist group, has been fighting the Afghan government for years. The group was ousted from power in 2001 by US-led forces but has been regaining territory in recent years. ISIS-K, meanwhile, is a breakaway faction of the Islamic State that operates in Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p>
  <p>Both groups have been targeting civilians, including religious minorities, with increasing frequency and severity. The Taliban has been accused of carrying out numerous attacks on Shia mosques in the past, while ISIS-K has been responsible for deadly attacks on schools and hospitals in recent months.</p>
  <h2>The Human Cost of Terrorism in Afghanistan</h2>
  <p>The rising threat of terrorism in Afghanistan has taken a heavy toll on the country's people. Thousands have been killed in bombings, shootings, and other terrorist attacks in recent years. The country is also facing a humanitarian crisis, with millions of Afghans in need of aid and assistance.</p>
  <p>Children have been among the hardest hit by the violence. Schools have been attacked by ISIS-K, and children have been kidnapped and killed by the Taliban. The UN recently reported that at least 1,848 children were killed or injured in Afghanistan in the first half of 2021 alone.</p>
  <h2>Tackling Terrorism in Afghanistan</h2>
  <p>Tackling terrorism in Afghanistan requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the root causes of extremism. This includes improving education and economic opportunities, promoting religious tolerance and understanding, and addressing political grievances.</p>
  <p>International support is also crucial for addressing the terrorist threat in Afghanistan. The international community must provide aid and assistance to the country's people, including those displaced by the violence. The UN has called for increased investment in the country's infrastructure, including roads, hospitals, and schools, to help build a more stable and prosperous Afghanistan.</p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>The recent mosque attack in Kandahar is a reminder of the ongoing threat of terrorism in Afghanistan. The country is facing a humanitarian crisis, and the situation is likely to get worse as the Taliban continues to gain ground. Addressing the root causes of extremism and providing international support are crucial for tackling the terrorist threat and building a more stable and prosperous Afghanistan.</p>
