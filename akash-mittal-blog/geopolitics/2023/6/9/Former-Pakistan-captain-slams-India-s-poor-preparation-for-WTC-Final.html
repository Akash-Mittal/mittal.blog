  <p>The World Test Championship (WTC) Final was the most anticipated cricketing event of the year. India, having dominated the tournament, was set to face the mighty Australia in the final showdown. However, former Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja pointed out India's poor preparation for the final and how it cost them the title. This article discusses India's poor preparation in three crucial aspects.</p>
  <h2>1. Lack of Match Practice</h2>
  <p>One of the crucial factors that led to India's loss was their lack of match practice in the lead up to the final. India played their last Test match against England in March 2021 and had no competitive cricket for almost three months before the WTC Final. On the other hand, Australia had played a full-fledged series against the West Indies and Bangladesh before arriving in England, giving them the much-needed match practice. India looked rusty in the match, and their batsmen struggled to adjust to the conditions, which ultimately led to their downfall.</p>
  <h3>Case Study:</h3>
  <p>India's opening batsman, Rohit Sharma, played his last Test match in February 2021 and had no red-ball cricket before the WTC Final. He looked out of sorts in the match, scoring just 34 runs in two innings, which included a soft dismissal in the second innings, and failed to give India a solid start.</p>
  <h2>2. Over-Reliance on their Spinners</h2>
  <p>India's bowling attack is known for its spin prowess, and the team management heavily relies on their spinners to take wickets. However, the pacers play a vital role in English conditions, where the ball swings and seams more initially. India picked two spinners in the final, which gave an advantage to the Australian batsmen, who are adept at playing spin. Also, the spinners were not able to exploit the early conditions, which resulted in Australia taking the upper hand in the match.</p>
  <h3>Case Study:</h3>
  <p>India's premier spinner, Ravichandran Ashwin, went wicketless in the first innings and took just one wicket in the second innings, which came when the match was almost over. On the other hand, Australian pacers made inroads upfront, which set the tone for the match.</p>
  <h2>3. Inability to Handle Pressure</h2>
  <p>The WTC Final was a high-pressure game, and India's lack of preparation showed in their inability to handle the pressure. India's batting line-up, known for its resilience, crumbled under pressure, and their experienced players failed to deliver when it mattered the most. India suffered a batting collapse in the first innings, which saw them getting bowled out for just 217 runs. They fared no better in the second innings, and the Australian pacers ran through their line-up, leaving them all out for a meagre 170 runs.</p>
  <h3>Case Study:</h3>
  <p>India's captain, Virat Kohli, known for his aggressive captaincy and batting skills, was out for a duck in the first innings, which set the tone for the rest of the match. He looked tentative in the second innings and was dismissed cheaply by Pat Cummins, effectively ending India's chances of making a comeback in the match.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>India's lack of preparation, over-reliance on spinners, and inability to handle pressure cost them the inaugural WTC title. The team management should take note of their shortcomings and prepare well for their upcoming assignments. The defeat should also serve as a wake-up call for the Indian cricketing fraternity, and they should work towards addressing the issues that surfaced during the match.</p><!-- References -->
