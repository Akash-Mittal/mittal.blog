   <p>Punjab Governor Banwari Lal Purohit recently called for surgical strikes against Pakistan, as he accused the neighbouring country of waging a disguised war against India. This war, according to Purohit, comes in the form of drone and drug infiltration that has been going on for years.</p>
   <h2>The "Silent War" waging in the Border States</h2>
   <p>There is no denying the fact that India has been dealing with numerous security challenges, especially in the border states like Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, and Northeastern India. Pakistan has long been accused of harbouring and supporting terrorists who carry out attacks on Indian soil. However, apart from terror activities, Pakistan has also been using other means to destabilize India.</p>
   <p>One of the most significant methods used by Pakistan is drone infiltration. Over the past few years, there have been multiple instances where drones loaded with weapons, drugs, and explosives have been found in Indian territories. Such drones are used by Pakistan-based militant groups to smuggle in arms, ammunition, and drugs into the country.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies of Drone Infiltrations and Drug Smuggling in Punjab</h2>
   <p>The Punjab state, in particular, has witnessed a surge in drone activities in recent times. The state has a long and porous border with Pakistan, making it a vulnerable spot for infiltration. There have been numerous incidents where drones have been spotted in Punjab, some of which have led to the recovery of weapons and drugs.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>In August 2019, a drone was shot down by the BSF along the Indo-Pak border in Punjab. Two AK-47 rifles, three magazines, and 24 rounds of ammunition were recovered from it.</li>
    <li>In September 2019, another drone was found in Punjab's Tarn Taran district, carrying 5 kg of heroin and other contraband items.</li>
    <li>In October 2020, a major terror module was busted by the Punjab Police, which was using drones to drop off weapons and ammunition in India.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>These are just a few examples of the countless incidents that have been reported from Punjab in recent times. The situation is dire, and the state government has been urging the central government for more support to combat these infiltrations.</p>
   <h2>Why Surgical Strikes?</h2>
   <p>When it comes to dealing with terror threats, India has always believed in a proactive approach. The surgical strikes carried out by the Indian Army in 2016, in response to the Uri attacks, were a clear indication of this. Such strikes send a strong message to the enemy, and they act as a deterrent for future attacks.</p>
   <p>Similarly, a surgical strike against Pakistan's terror infrastructure and drone factories could help India gain the upper hand in this "silent war". It would not only destroy the enemy's capabilities but also convey a clear message that India is not afraid to take the fight to its enemy's territory.</p>
   <h2>The Need for a Comprehensive Approach</h2>
   <p>Surgical strikes, while effective, cannot be a one-stop solution to the problem. India needs to take a comprehensive approach to deal with the problem of cross-border infiltrations. This includes:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Strengthening border defences and surveillance with advanced technologies like drone radars and thermal imaging cameras.</li>
    <li>Bolstering intelligence gathering and sharing between various agencies to pre-empt terror attacks.</li>
    <li>Ensuring strict border vigilance and swift action against any suspicious activities.</li>
    <li>Close cooperation between the central and state governments and sharing of resources to combat these threats.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The situation in the border states is critical and calls for urgent action. The recent call by Punjab Governor Banwari Lal Purohit for surgical strikes against Pakistan may have its advantages, but it should not be seen as a panacea. India needs a multifaceted approach to deal effectively with the problem of cross-border infiltrations.</p>
   <p>The government needs to take proactive measures to secure our borders and prevent the enemy from exploiting our vulnerabilities. The need of the hour is for a collaborative effort by all stakeholders to neutralise the threat and maintain peace and stability in the region.</p>
