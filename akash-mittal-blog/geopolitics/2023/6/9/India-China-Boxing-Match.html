   <p>It's often said that countries these days do not go to war with each other; instead, they engage in economic warfare and diplomatic jousts. But it seems like India and China are engaged in a boxing match that has been ongoing for several years now, and shows no sign of stopping anytime soon.</p>
   <p>The 2017 Doklam stand-off in Bhutan, the 2018 Maldives crisis, and the 2020 Nepal Kalapani border dispute are just a few examples of how Beijing has been using smaller countries as pawns, leveraging their strategic location to target India. Let's take a closer look at each of these cases:</p>
   <h2>The 2017 Doklam Stand-Off</h2>
   <p>In 2017, India and China were involved in a tense stand-off at the Doklam plateau, a disputed tri-junction border area between China, Bhutan, and India. The dispute began after China tried to extend a road on the plateau, which Bhutan claimed was on its land. The Indian Army, which had a security pact with Bhutan, intervened to stop the Chinese road-building activity, resulting in a lengthy military stand-off that lasted for over two months.</p>
   <p>The Doklam stand-off was a major turning point in India-China relations as it marked the first time in decades that Indian forces stepped in to directly oppose China. The stand-off eventually ended with both sides agreeing to disengage their troops, but it left a lasting impact on the relationship between the two Asian giants.</p>
   <h2>The 2018 Maldives Crisis</h2>
   <p>In 2018, the Indian Ocean archipelago nation of Maldives plunged into a major political crisis after President Abdulla Yameen declared a state of emergency and cracked down on opposition leaders and the judiciary. India, which considers the Maldives to be within its geopolitical sphere of influence, sent troops to several strategic locations in the Maldives to protect its interests.</p>
   <p>China, however, had been propping up the Yameen regime with financial aid and infrastructure projects, and saw India's intervention as an encroachment on its own sphere of influence. Tensions rose between the two Asian giants, with China accusing India of meddling in the Maldives' internal affairs.</p>
   <h2>The 2020 Nepal Kalapani Border Dispute</h2>
   <p>In 2020, Nepal released a new political map that included the disputed Kalapani area along its border with India. India rejected Nepal's claims, saying the area had always been part of Indian territory. The Kalapani dispute touched off a diplomatic row between the two countries, with each side summoning the other's envoy and accusing the other of violating their territorial integrity.</p>
   <p>China, which has been trying to expand its influence in Nepal, saw an opportunity to exploit the situation to its advantage. Chinese ambassador to Nepal, Hou Yanqi, met several top Nepalese leaders and, according to reports, urged them to stand firm against India's "bullying".</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The India-China boxing match is not a new phenomenon and can be traced back to the 1962 border war between the two countries. However, in recent years, China's tactics seem to have changed, with Beijing using smaller countries as pawns to target India. This approach has led to a deterioration in relations between the two Asian giants, resulting in heightened tensions along their disputed border.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, the India-China boxing match shows no signs of stopping anytime soon, and could have major implications for the stability of the Asia-Pacific region. It is important for both countries to engage in dialogue and find a peaceful resolution to their disputes, rather than resorting to military action or economic warfare.</p>
