  <h1>Before talking cooperation, China needs to stop aggression against India</h1></br> <img src="images/China-India-cooperation.jpeg" alt="+China-India-cooperation+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/before-talking-cooperation-china-needs-to-stop-aggression-against-india-8653342/" target="_blank" href="https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/before-talking-cooperation-china-needs-to-stop-aggression-against-india-8653342/" rel="noopener">https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/before-talking-cooperation-china-needs-to-stop-aggression-against-india-8653342/</a></span></h5>
  <p>China and India have a long-standing history of diplomatic tensions and border disputes. The recent escalation in border tensions between the two countries has further complicated the scenario. The clash at Ladakh's Galwan Valley in June 2020, which resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers and unknown casualties on the Chinese side, has only added fuel to the fire.</p>
  <h2>China's aggression towards India</h2>
  <p>China's aggression towards India spans across various sectors, including border disputes, trade, and technology. The Doklam crisis of 2017, which lasted for 73 days, was another instance of China's aggressive stance towards India. Besides, China's support to Pakistan, a country with which India has strained relations, also adds to the tension.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, China's constant blocking of India's entry into the Nuclear Suppliers Group and its opposition to India's bid for a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council has led to India's growing distrust of China.</p>
  <h2>Impact of tension on cooperation</h2>
  <p>China and India are two of the most populous countries in the world. The two countries have the potential to complement each other's economy and culture. However, the growing tension between the two countries has acted as a barrier to cooperation.</p>
  <p>The recent ban on Chinese apps, including TikTok and WeChat, in India has led to a dip in China's revenue from the Indian market. Moreover, Indian companies such as Tata, Infosys, and Reliance have been exploring ways to reduce their dependence on China for technology and equipment, which will further damage the economic ties between the two countries.</p>
  <h2>Psychological makeover and de-escalation of border tensions</h2>
  <p>If China wishes to work together for global growth, now is the time to opt for a psychological makeover and dial down border tensions. China needs to recognize India's rightful place in the world and work towards a peaceful resolution of border disputes. Furthermore, China needs to abandon its predatory economic practices and adopt a fair and transparent approach in trade relations.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>China and India have a lot to offer to each other and the world. However, the unresolved border disputes and constant aggression by China towards India have severely impacted the cooperation between the two countries. China needs to realize that cooperation is not possible without mutual trust and respect.</p>
