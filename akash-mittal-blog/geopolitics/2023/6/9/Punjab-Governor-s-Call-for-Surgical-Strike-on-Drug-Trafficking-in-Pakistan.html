  <p>India has been battling with the menace of drug addiction and trafficking for years, with the state of Punjab being the hardest hit. While the issue has been a concern for many, it took a fresh turn when the Governor of Punjab, Banwarilal Purohit, backed a 'surgical strike' on Pakistan for pushing drugs into India.</p>
  <h2>The Link Between Pakistan and Drug Trafficking in India</h2>
  <p>According to Purohit, the Pakistani establishment has been trying to make the next generation of Indians drug addicts. The influx of narcotics from Pakistan has grown alarmingly in recent years, with Punjab being the prime target due to its proximity to the international border. Purohit claimed to have received several complaints that drugs had made their way into schools, and students were becoming addicts and stealing money from home to support their addiction.</p>
  <p>Recent arrests of drug smugglers in Punjab have exposed the deep-rooted nexus between Pakistani smugglers and their Indian counterparts. Several high-profile cases have come to light, implicating politicians, police officers, and even customs officials in the trade of illegal substances.</p>
  <h2>The Impact of Drug Addiction on Youth</h2>
  <p>The youth are the primary targets of drug trafficking, and the consequences of addiction are far-reaching. Drug abuse leads to a variety of physical and mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, psychosis, and even death from overdose or related complications.</p>
  <p>Drug addiction also fuels crime, leading to an increase in thefts and other petty crimes. It creates a vicious cycle, where the addict is forced to engage in criminal activities to fund their addiction, leading to further addiction and criminal behavior.</p>
  <h2>A Call to Action</h2>
  <p>The problem of drug trafficking and addiction is a complex issue that requires multi-faceted solutions. While border control and crackdowns on drug cartels are necessary, they are not enough.</p>
  <p>Preventive measures, such as education and awareness campaigns, are crucial in tackling the issue. It is essential to create a supportive environment for those who seek help to overcome addiction. Similarly, rehabilitation and counseling services must be accessible to those in need.</p>
  <p>To conclude, it is time for the governments to take decisive action against the drug trafficking from Pakistan. The Punjab Governor's plea for a 'surgical strike' on drug smuggling is a step in the right direction. However, it must be backed by practical and sustainable solutions aimed at preventing drug addiction and rehabilitating those who are already suffering from its impact.</p>
