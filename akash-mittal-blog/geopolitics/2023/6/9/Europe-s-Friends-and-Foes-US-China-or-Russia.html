  <p>Europe is facing a complex scenario in terms of international relations. The most recent poll from the European Council on Foreign Relations shows a significant shift in attitudes of Europeans towards the US, China, and Russia. This article delves into the current situation in Europe, and how the three countries are seen from a European point of view.</p>
  <h2>The Changing Perceptions of Europe</h2>
  <p>Over the last few years, the world has seen the rise of authoritarian regimes across the globe and with it an increase in hostility. Coupled with that, there has been a migrant crisis that has left a significant impact on Europe. Fear of terrorism, increased economic inequality, and controversial policies are only some of the many problems Europe faces.</p>
  <p>This situation has given rise to a sense of unease, and in such circumstances, people often look for friends who can give assurances. The Americans who have long been European allies, are no longer considered reliable. According to research, only 41% of Europeans view the US as trustworthy.</p>
  <h2>The Rise of China</h2>
  <p>As the United States loses the trust of Europe, China is becoming an increasingly attractive option. The country has offered a lot in terms of trade and economic partnerships, and the Chinese have shown a keen interest in investing in Europe. European businesses are also eager to do business with China, and this has led to a growing sense of enthusiasm in Europe.</p>
  <p>It is worth noting though that not everything is smooth sailing with China. In some respects, the Chinese government is just as autocratic as Russia and its economic policies often lack transparency. However, Europe is willing to overlook such issues in return for China's economic power.</p>
  <h2>The Strongman of Russia</h2>
  <p>Last but not least, Russia cannot be ignored in Europe's list of friends and foes. The country is on Europe's border, and the two regions share a complex history. There are still territories that claim Russian identity but are not fully in the Russian Federation.</p>
  <p>With regard to Russia, Europe is not of a single mind. The western states, who were the victims of the Crimean invasion, are inherently cautious about Russia. However, the eastern countries (former members of the Warsaw Pact) have a more complex relationship with Russia. For these nations, Russia was the enemy, but simultaneously provided a sense of security against potential threats.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Europe's relationship with China, Russia, and the US is in constant flux. However, the trend in recent years has been a shift in focus and recognition that the power balance is changing. The US, which was once a reliable ally, is struggling to maintain its standing. On the other hand, China is a useful partner that Europe views as a balance against the US. Russia, for its part, remains a complex country with whom Europe shares a complex relationship.</p>
