   <p>On May 15th, 2021, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced his visit to China after China expressed its willingness to broker Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. This comes after China successfully brokered the restoration of ties between gulf arch-rivals, Iran and Saudi Arabia, sparking an increase in Chinese activities in the Middle East.</p>
   <h2>China's Growing Presence in the Middle East</h2>
   <p>China has been increasing its presence in the Middle East in recent years, mostly due to its economic interests. China is the world's second-largest oil consumer, and the Middle East is home to some of the world's largest oil reserves. For this reason, China has been investing heavily in Middle Eastern countries such as Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.</p>
   <p>But it's not just about oil. China has also been investing in infrastructure projects such as ports and railways, as part of its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative. These projects are seen as strategic investments that will give China greater access to key markets in Europe and Africa.</p>
   <h2>China's Role in the Israel-Palestine Conflict</h2>
   <p>The Israel-Palestine conflict has been ongoing for decades, with numerous attempts to broker peace talks ending in failure. However, China's growing presence in the region could potentially bring a new perspective to the conflict, as China has a history of neutral diplomacy and non-interference in other countries' domestic affairs.</p>
   <p>China has also been a vocal supporter of the Palestinian cause, calling for an independent Palestinian state and recognizing the state of Palestine in 1988. China has also provided millions of dollars in aid to Palestine over the years.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, China has good relations with both Israel and Palestine, which could make it an ideal mediator in any peace talks. China-Israel trade reached $13 billion in 2019, while China and Palestine signed a free trade agreement in 2015.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>China's increasing activities in the Middle East, including its willingness to broker Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, could potentially bring a new perspective to the conflict. China's history of neutral diplomacy and non-interference in other countries' domestic affairs, as well as its good relations with both Israel and Palestine, make it an ideal mediator in any peace talks. However, it remains to be seen whether China can successfully broker a peace deal in one of the world's most complex and enduring conflicts.</p>
