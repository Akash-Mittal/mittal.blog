    <p>It was a humid afternoon in Lahore when the news broke that a group of disgruntled leaders who quit Pakistan's former prime minister Imran Khan's party had joined hands and were set to launch a new political party with military-backing.</p>
    <p>The defections from the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) were seen as a major blow for Khan, who had swept to power on a wave of anti-corruption sentiment and promised to make Pakistan a better place for its people.</p>
    <p>But as time passed, it became clear that the PTI defectors had found a new leader in the form of a former member of Khan's party, who had been expelled for speaking out against the leadership.</p>
    <p>This new leader, who has not yet been named, quickly began to attract other disaffected politicians from across the country, with scores of PTI members defecting to the new party in quick succession.</p>
    <p>Many of these defectors cited a lack of internal democracy within the PTI, as well as concerns over the party's ties to the military establishment.</p>
    <p>These concerns are not new. Pakistan has a long history of military intervention in politics, with the military often seen as the ultimate power-broker in the country.</p>
    <p>However, the extent of the military's involvement in politics has been a matter of debate for many years, with some arguing that the military has too much power, while others argue that it is necessary to safeguard the country's security.</p>
    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <h3>Case Study 1: The PTI</h3>
    <p>Founded in 1996, the PTI was initially seen as a small, populist movement with an anti-corruption message. However, over the years, the party has grown in size and influence, with Imran Khan becoming a leading figure in Pakistani politics.</p>
    <p>However, the PTI has been beset by internal divisions and rivalries, with many members feeling that Khan has not lived up to his promises of reform and change.</p>
    <p>These divisions came to a head in 2020, when a group of senior PTI members resigned from the party in protest at what they saw as the party's lack of internal democracy and Khan's increasing alignment with the military.</p>
    <h3>Case Study 2: The PML-N</h3>
    <p>The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) is one of Pakistan's oldest political parties, and has a storied history of contesting elections and holding power at the national level.</p>
    <p>However, like the PTI, the PML-N has faced allegations of corruption and mismanagement, and has been accused of being too closely aligned with the military establishment.</p>
    <p>Despite these allegations, the PML-N remains a major force in Pakistani politics, with a large following in Punjab province.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The defections from the PTI and the launch of a new party with military backing are just the latest examples of the ongoing struggles within Pakistani politics.</p>
    <p>While some argue that the military is playing too large a role in politics, others believe that it is necessary to safeguard the country's security in a region where instability and conflict are the norm.</p>
    <p>Whatever one's perspective, it is clear that Pakistan's political landscape is complex and fraught with challenges, and that any lasting solution will require political will and a commitment to democracy.</p>
