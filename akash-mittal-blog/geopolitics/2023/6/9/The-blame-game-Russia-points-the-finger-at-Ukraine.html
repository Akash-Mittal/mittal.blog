    <h2>An interesting story</h2>
    <p>Blaming someone else for their problems or mistakes is not a new phenomenon. In the world of international politics, the blame game has become a common occurrence between nations. Case in point: Russia and Ukraine.</p>
    <p>Russia's Defense Ministry recently accused a Ukrainian sabotage group of destroying an ammonia pipeline in Kharkiv, Ukraine. This accusation is just the latest in a long string of blame games between the two nations. Both sides have been accusing each other of various incidents, ranging from cyber attacks to military aggression.</p>
    <p>One can argue that this blame game started when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. The annexation was met with international condemnation, but Russia has maintained that it was acting to protect the Russian-speaking population in Crimea. Ukraine, on the other hand, sees the annexation as an act of aggression by Russia.</p>
    <p>Fast forward to 2021, and the situation between Russia and Ukraine has not improved. The two countries remain at loggerheads, and incidents like the destruction of the ammonia pipeline only serve to fuel the tension between them.</p>

    <h2>Examples with case studies</h2>
    <p>The blame game between Russia and Ukraine has been ongoing for years. Here are some examples:</p>
    <ul>
     <li><strong>2014:</strong> Russia annexes Crimea from Ukraine, leading to international condemnation and sanctions against Russia.</li>
     <li><strong>2015:</strong> A Russian fighter jet is shot down by Turkey, and Russia accuses Turkey of supporting terrorism in Syria.</li>
     <li><strong>2016:</strong> Russian hackers are accused of interfering in the US presidential election.</li>
     <li><strong>2018:</strong> Ukraine accuses Russia of illegally seizing three of its naval vessels near the Kerch Strait.</li>
     <li><strong>2021:</strong> Russia accuses Ukraine of destroying an ammonia pipeline in Kharkiv.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As can be seen from these examples, the blame game is a well-established cycle between these two nations. Each incident leads to accusations, denials, and counter-accusations, with no end in sight.</p>
