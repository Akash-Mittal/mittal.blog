  <p>Once upon a time, there were two neighboring countries: China and India. They shared a border that spanned over 3,400 kilometers, and their history was marked by a complex relationship that oscillated between harmony and conflict. One day, China proposed a new initiative for global growth and development, and India was intrigued. However, there was a catch - China had been engaging in aggressive behavior towards India, particularly along the border in the Himalayas. India could not help but wonder: how could they cooperate with China while feeling threatened by their actions?</p>
  <p>This story reflects the current state of China-India relations. On the one hand, there is a growing interest in cooperation for matters of global significance, such as trade, climate change, and pandemic management. On the other hand, there is an ongoing conflict over territory and sovereignty that has led to military standoffs and diplomatic tensions.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Aggression</h2>
  <p>China's aggression towards India dates back several decades, but it has intensified in recent years. The most notable example is the border dispute in the Galwan Valley, where Indian and Chinese troops clashed in June 2020, resulting in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers and an unknown number of Chinese casualties. This incident marked the first deadly clash between the two sides in over 45 years, and it signaled a significant escalation in the ongoing standoff over contested territory.</p>
  <p>Other examples of Chinese aggression towards India include:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Encroachments across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Ladakh region</li>
   <li>Attempts to block India's membership in the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the United Nations Security Council</li>
   <li>Support for Pakistan's anti-India activities and terrorist groups</li>
   <li>Cyberattacks and espionage targeting Indian businesses and government entities</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Psychological Makeover</h2>
  <p>If China wants to work together with India for global growth, it needs to undergo a psychological makeover that involves several key components:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Respect for India's territorial integrity and sovereignty</li>
   <li>Transparency in dealing with India, particularly in matters related to border security and regional stability</li>
   <li>Commitment to non-interference in India's internal affairs</li>
   <li>Recognition of India's status as a rising power and a major player on the global stage</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Such a makeover is not only necessary but also achievable. China has shown a willingness to cooperate with other countries, such as the United States and Europe, on issues of common concern. It has also demonstrated a capacity for soft power, through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. By adopting a similar approach towards India, China can overcome its reputation as a regional bully and emerge as a responsible stakeholder in the international system.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, China and India can cooperate for global growth, but only if China stops its aggression towards India. A psychological makeover that incorporates respect, transparency, commitment, and recognition is necessary to build trust and foster cooperation. If China takes this step, it can help create a more peaceful and prosperous world for all.</p><!-- References -->
