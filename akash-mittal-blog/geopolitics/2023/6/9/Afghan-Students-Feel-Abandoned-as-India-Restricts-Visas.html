   <p>As the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, the world was left in shock and awe. One group who were immediately left vulnerable were Afghan students seeking education and better opportunities abroad. Many of these students had already secured admission to Indian universities and were eagerly looking forward to resuming their studies. However, their dreams were shattered when the Indian government suspended all visa issuance to Afghan nationals.</p>
   <p>This sudden change of policy has left hundreds of Afghan students with no option but to delay or even abandon their academic pursuits. They feel betrayed by a country they considered a friend and mentor. Some students who had spent years preparing for the highly competitive Indian entrance exams have been left in limbo, uncertain about their future.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <h3>Shah Jahan from Kabul</h3>
   <p>Shah Jahan, a 24-year-old student from Kabul, had secured admission in a prestigious Indian university for a master's degree in computer science. He had spent months preparing for the entrance exam and was confident of securing a scholarship. However, his dreams were shattered when the Indian embassy in Kabul informed him that they were no longer issuing visas to Afghan nationals. Shah Jahan is now struggling to find an alternative university that can offer him a similar course and scholarship.</p>
   <h3>Zainab from Herat</h3>
   <p>Zainab, a 21-year-old student from Herat, had completed her undergraduate degree in economics from an Indian university and was eager to pursue a master's degree in the same subject. Her parents had invested their life savings to ensure that Zainab could pursue her education in India. However, their dreams were shattered when the Indian embassy in Kabul informed them that they were no longer issuing visas to Afghan nationals. Zainab is now at a loss, unsure about her future and her parents' life savings now seem to be a waste.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The situation in Afghanistan is highly volatile and uncertain. The Taliban's return to power has raised concerns about women's education, freedom of speech, and minority rights. In such a scenario, it is crucial for the international community to support Afghan students who are trying to build a better future for themselves and their country. Denying them the opportunity to pursue their academic dreams is not only unfair but is also detrimental to their mental and emotional well-being.</p>
   <p>Therefore, it is imperative that the Indian government re-evaluates its visa policy towards Afghan students and finds a way to support them in their academic pursuits. It is also the responsibility of other countries to step forward and offer assistance to Afghan students seeking education abroad.</p>
