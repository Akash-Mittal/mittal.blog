  <p>As the world is economy transforms, China, the world's second-largest economy, has become a significant trade partner for many countries, with Australia being one of them. However, with China's growing assertiveness in the region and the world, Australia finds itself struggling to maintain a healthy and stable relationship with its largest trading partner. In this article, we explore how Australia is striving to stabilise, rather than normalise, the relationship with China.</p>
  <h2>The Background</h2>
  <p>Over the last two decades, China's economic expansion has been spectacular, giving it immense economic clout and also made it a dominant regional player. While countries like Australia have reaped the benefits of China's growth, they are increasingly becoming worried about China's growing assertiveness, especially in the Indo-Pacific. In recent times, Australia has accused China of interference in local politics, cyber-attacks, and coercive economic pressure, thus straining the bilateral relationship.</p>
  <p>Historically, the relationship between Australia and China was a cordial one, with Australia recognising the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1972. The relationship improved with time, with the focus being on trade and economic cooperation, resulting in China becoming Australia's largest trading partner in 2009. However, this relationship's smooth ride came to an end in 2017, when Australia introduced legislation to tackle foreign interference in domestic politics, widely seen as a move to counter China's influence in Australia. China, in response, accused Australia of "ideological bias" and trying to contain China's growth.</p>
  <h2>Stabilising the Relationship with China</h2>
  <p>Australia increasingly finds itself in a challenging position, with relations with its largest trade partner at a nadir; at the same time, it needs to maintain the values, sovereignty and security of its own country while not disrupting trade and economic cooperation. As a result, Australia's strategy has been to stabilise the relationship rather than normalise the relationship.</p>
  <h3>Stabilising Trade</h3>
  <p>As China's economic power has grown, it has been widely recognised that Australia's economic dependence on China cannot be underestimated. In 2019â€“20, China was by far Australia's most significant export market, accounting for 38% of all exports. However, the Chinese government has used economic coercion to punish Australia for its recent criticism of China's human rights violations, leading to curbs on Australian exports. In response, Australia has embarked on diversifying its trade, which had a positive effect on the agricultural sector, with their exports to India, Japan and South Korea increasing. Australia also signed the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), a free trade agreement between 11 countries, including Canada, Japan, and New Zealand.</p>
  <h3>Stabilising Security and Defence</h3>
  <p>Australia's commitment to a robust and resilient defence force has been an integral part of its relationship with the United States. This has been part of the ANZUS Treaty alliance, which formalised Australia's defence alliance with the United States. As part of its strategy for a stable relationship with China, Australia has expanded its security and defence ties with other regional partners. This includes establishing the Quad, which is aimed at countering China's assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region. The Quad, consisting of Australia, India, Japan and the United States, has been termed as a diplomatic coup by some analysts, as it brings together democracies from across the region and sends a strong message to China.</p>
  <h3>Stabilising Diplomatic Relations</h3>
  <p>Since 2018, there has been a significant deterioration in Australia's diplomatic relationship with China, with China hitting back with trade reprisals and trade sanctions. China has been targeting various industries in Australia with economic measures taken against Australian barley, wine, beef, and seafood exports. Australia responded by calling for an "immediate suspension" of live animal exports to China, effectively cutting off an industry worth AUD 800 million to Australia. Australia's strategy has been to stabilise diplomatic relations by engaging with other countries in the region such as Japan, Indonesia and India, to create a regional response to China's assertiveness.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Australia's current relationship with China is in a precarious position, owing to China's increasing assertiveness in the region and the world. While Australia seeks to maintain its economic relationship with China, it is also keen to protect its values, security and sovereignty. To achieve this, Australia is focusing on stabilising, not normalising, the relationship with China by diversifying its trade, expanding its security and defence partnerships with other regional players, and engaging with other regional countries to create a regional response to China's assertiveness. While this approach comes with its challenges, it provides the best possible way forward for Australia as it seeks to tackle China's growing assertiveness.</p>
