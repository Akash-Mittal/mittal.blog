   <h2>An interesting story</h2>
   <p>Xiaomi, the Chinese smartphone maker, has become a household name in India due to its high-quality, affordable smartphones that cater to the needs of the average Indian consumer. However, a recent investigation by India's Enforcement Directorate has uncovered some alarming information. The agency has issued a show-cause notice to Xiaomi's India unit, its officials, and three banks for illegal remittances amounting to 55.51 billion Indian rupees ($673.2 million). This is a serious matter and has raised concerns about the legality of Xiaomi's operations in India.</p>
   <h2>Examples and case studies</h2>
   <p>The incident involving Xiaomi is not an isolated case and has been seen in recent years in many other industries. Companies often resort to illegal means to transfer funds overseas to evade taxes or hide profits. Such practices undermine the integrity of the Indian economy and can have severe consequences.</p>
   <p>One such example is the case of Vodafone, which was accused of evading taxes by transferring funds to its parent company in the UK. The dispute lasted for more than a decade, and the final settlement amounted to $2 billion. Another example is the case of IBM, which was found to have transferred funds illegally from India to its subsidiaries in Mauritius and the Netherlands to evade taxes. The company had to pay a penalty of $200 million to settle the dispute.</p>
   <p>The extent of illegal remittances in India is alarming, and it is estimated that the country loses around $10 billion every year due to such practices. The government has taken several measures to address this issue, such as the introduction of the FEMA and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). However, more needs to be done to curb the illegal transfer of funds overseas.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion in 3 points</h2>

    <li>The show-cause notice issued to Xiaomi by India's Enforcement Directorate for illegal remittances is a cause for concern.</li>
