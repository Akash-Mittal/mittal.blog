   <h2>An Analysis</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>Imagine a world without electricity; it is virtually impossible, as most of the world's basic activities, including transportation, depend on this vital source of energy. With the rise of electric vehicles (EVs), the use of electricity as a source of power is becoming more widespread. The energy sector is transforming and undergoing rapid advancements, both in technology and innovations. However, even with the increasing popularity of EVs, there are still significant challenges to overcome. One such challenge is the sourcing of critical minerals for the production of batteries.</p>
   <p>According to the chief executive of electric truck maker Rivian, the US needs to expand the scope of eligible critical minerals for EVs. The current law forces automakers to obtain these materials from only a few countries with which the US has a trade agreement. Although this was a step in the right direction, it is now apparent that the current scope needs expansion to include sourcing from other countries.</p>
   <h3>Case Studies</h3>
   <p>The sourcing of critical minerals proved challenging in 2018 when Tesla Inc. experienced a shortage of lithium, which was resolved after the automaker formed a partnership with another mining company. Another significant player in the EV market is General Motors, which launched its new all-electric vehicle "Hummer EV" in October 2020. The Hummer EV uses Ultium Cells batteries that contain nickel, cobalt, and manganese sourced from Canada and Australia. However, this still leaves out potential sources in other countries like South Africa, which has the world's largest reserves of platinum, another critical mineral for EV batteries.</p>
   <p>Another case study is the country Chile, which provides over one-third of the world's copper supply, an essential material in EV batteries. However, Chile is frequently marred by labor issues that could affect the potential supply of copper for the successful implementation of EVs globally. Therefore, it is necessary to source critical minerals from other countries to minimize the risk of supply chain disruption and volatility in prices.</p>
   <h3>Conclusion in Three Points</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>The US needs to expand the scope of eligible critical minerals for the production of EV batteries</li>
    <li>Current limitations in the sourcing of critical minerals from a limited number of countries could result in a high-risk supply chain for automakers</li>
    <li>Expanding sourcing of critical minerals would help minimize supply chain disruptions and ensure sustainability in the production of EVs</li>
   </ol>
