  <p>A newly assertive China is leading to a shift in US geopolitical priorities and strategy in Asia.</p>
  
  <p>In 2013, China declared its Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) over the East China Sea, which includes the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands. This move immediately escalated tensions in the region as it requires all aircraft entering the zone to identify themselves and follow Chinese instructions. The US and Japan were quick to challenge the ADIZ, with the US sending two B-52 bombers into the zone without notifying China. This incident highlighted the US's determination to not acknowledge China's territorial claims and sparked a larger discussion on the importance of the Asia-Pacific region in US foreign policy.</p>
  <h2>Examples with Case Studies</h2>
  <h3>Shift in Military Focus</h3>
  <p>The US has been shifting its focus to the Asia-Pacific region in recent years, as seen in the deployment of military assets. In 2017, the US sent its aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson to the Korean Peninsula to deter North Korea from conducting nuclear tests. The US has also increased the number of military exercises with its Asian allies, such as the annual Balikatan exercise with the Philippines. The US has also been increasing its presence in the region by establishing military bases in places like Australia and Guam.</p>
  <h3>Trade War with China</h3>
  <p>The US has also been engaging in a trade war with China, which has major implications for the Asia-Pacific region. In 2018, the US imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports, leading to retaliatory tariffs from China. This trade war has affected other countries in the region, as they are major exporters to both the US and China. For example, Taiwan's semiconductor industry was hit hard by the trade war as they export to both countries.</p>
