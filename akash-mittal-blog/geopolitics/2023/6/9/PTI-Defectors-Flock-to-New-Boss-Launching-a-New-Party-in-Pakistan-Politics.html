   <p>Politics in Pakistan has always been a chaotic affair, with many parties and politicians vying for power. Recently, a new development has taken place in the political scene, as scores of disgruntled leaders who quit Pakistan's former prime minister Imran Khan's party have joined hands and are set to launch a new military-back party.</p>
   <p>This new development has been made possible due to the growing discontent within Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. Many PTI leaders have expressed their frustration with the policies, leadership, and direction of the party.</p>
   <p>Some of the prominent defectors who have joined the new party include Jahangir Tareen, a former PTI Secretary General, and Khurram Sher Zaman, a former member of the PTI's Central Executive Committee.</p>
   <p>However, the biggest defection so far has been that of Shahbaz Sharif, the former chief minister of Punjab and the leader of Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) in Punjab. His defection has dealt a severe blow to the PML-N, which was already struggling to gain political ground after the imprisonment of its leader Nawaz Sharif on corruption charges.</p>
   <h2>Why are PTI Defectors Flocking to the New Party?</h2>
   <p>The new party that is set to launch is believed to be backed by Pakistan's military establishment. This backing has made many PTI defectors see it as a viable alternative to the PTI, which they believe has failed to live up to its promises.</p>
   <p>One of the main reasons behind the growing frustration with the PTI is its economic policies. PTI came to power on the promise of creating jobs, reducing poverty, and improving the economy. However, the reality has been different. The economy has been struggling, and unemployment and poverty have increased during PTI's tenure.</p>
   <p>Another factor contributing to the growing frustration is the leadership of Imran Khan. Many PTI leaders believe that Khan has failed to provide strong leadership and has instead been focused on his own personal agenda.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies: Defectors and the Impact on Pakistan Politics</h2>
   <p>The defection of Shahbaz Sharif from PML-N to the new party is a significant blow to the PML-N, which was already struggling to regain momentum after the imprisonment of its leader, Nawaz Sharif.</p>
   <p>Sharif has been a prominent figure in Pakistan politics for many years, and his defection to the new party is seen as a sign of growing discontent with the PML-N's leadership. The PML-N has already lost ground in the recent elections, and Sharif's departure may further dent its chances of making a comeback.</p>
   <p>The defection of Jahangir Tareen, a prominent PTI leader and a close ally of Imran Khan, has also sent shockwaves through the PTI. Tareen was seen as one of the key players in the PTI's rise to power, and his departure is seen as a sign of growing dissatisfaction within the party.</p>
   <p>Khurram Sher Zaman's defection is also notable as he was a member of the PTI's Central Executive Committee, which is the highest decision-making body of the party. His departure has raised questions about the PTI's ability to retain its most important leaders.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion: A New Direction in Pakistan Politics</h2>
   <p>The launch of the new party backed by Pakistan's military establishment has the potential to change the political dynamics in the country. The growing dissatisfaction with the PTI and the PML-N has created a vacuum that the new party can fill.</p>
   <p>However, it remains to be seen how successful the new party will be. Political parties in Pakistan have a history of short-lived existence, and the new party will need to work hard to gain the trust of the people and establish itself as a viable alternative to the PTI and PML-N.</p>
   <p>Only time will tell whether the new party will be able to make a significant impact on Pakistan politics, or whether it will join the long list of short-lived political parties in the country.</p>
