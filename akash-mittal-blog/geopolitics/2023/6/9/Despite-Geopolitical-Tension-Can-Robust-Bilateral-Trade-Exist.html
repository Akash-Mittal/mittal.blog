  <p>It's a little awkward, but in fact, a reality in this day and age that bilateral trade between two countries who view each other as somewhat adversarial, can co-exist economically. Take Australia and China, for example. Despite some diplomatic tensions between the two governments, trade between these two nations has witnessed significant growth over the years and has been a win-win situation for both nations.</p>
  <h2>Case Study: Australia-China Trade Relations</h2>
  <p>In recent years, trade between Australia and China has seen steady growth despite occasional diplomatic spats. In 2020, China was Australia's largest trading partner with bilateral trade reaching AUD 194.6 billion (approx. $149 billion USD). Exports of natural resources from Australia to China have been a key driver of this bilateral trade relationship.</p>
  <p>However, the relationship between the two nations has not been without its challenges. In 2020, China imposed tariffs on Australian barley and suspended imports of Australian beef. This was seen as a response to perceived anti-China sentiment coming out of Australia. Nevertheless, despite these disruptions, bilateral trade between the two nations has continued to flourish.</p>
  <h2>Why Bilateral Trade Works Despite Geopolitical Tension</h2>
  <p>While it is true that geopolitical tension can cause disruptions to bilateral trade, there are a number of reasons why trade between adversarial nations can continue to exist:</p>
  <h3>1. Economic Interdependence</h3>
  <p>When two nations have robust bilateral trade relations, they become economically interdependent. This means that any disruptions to trade can harm both nations. For example, a suspension of imports of natural resources from Australia to China would harm China's manufacturing industry while at the same time significantly impact Australia's economy. Hence, both nations have an incentive to continue trading with each other despite any political differences.</p>
  <h3>2. Diversification of Trading Partnerships</h3>
  <p>For many nations, having a diversified portfolio of trading partners is a key strategy for mitigating geopolitical risks. This means that even if a nation has strained relations with one trading partner, it can still maintain trade relationships with other nations. This diversification helps to reduce over-reliance on a specific country or market.</p>
  <h3>3. Separating Politics from Economics</h3>
  <p>While geopolitics can often be a contentious issue, economics is less divisive. Bilateral trade relationships often operate on business principles regardless of political differences. For example, a company in Australia may want to sell coal to China for a profit, and a Chinese company may want to buy that coal for its own manufacturing needs. The decision to trade is therefore based on commercial rather than political objectives.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Bilateral trade relationships can continue to prosper despite geopolitical tension between nations. Australia and China provide a case in point. Despite occasional political disputes, the two nations have a robust trading relationship which has been beneficial for both. Economic interdependence, diversification of trading partnerships, and separating politics from economics are all key factors that enable bilateral trade to survive and even thrive in the face of political differences.</p><!-- Reference URLs -->
