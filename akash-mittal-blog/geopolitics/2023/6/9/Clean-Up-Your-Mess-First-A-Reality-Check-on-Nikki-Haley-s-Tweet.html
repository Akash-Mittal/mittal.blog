  <p>Have you ever heard the story of a pot calling the kettle black? Well, that's exactly what happened when Nikki Haley, a United States Republican presidential candidate and an Indian-origin woman, claimed India and China as top polluters. However, the United States has emitted more Carbon Dioxide than any other country to date. It is responsible for 25% of historical emissions, around 400 billion tonnes since 1751. This tweet by Nikki Haley has caused a huge furor on the internet, especially in India. In this article, we will take a reality check and evaluate the facts to see if Haley's claim holds any water.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Firstly, let's look at some examples of how United States' emissions compare with India and China. According to the World Bank, United States' Carbon Dioxide emissions per capita is 16.5 metric tonnes, compared to India's 1.9 metric tonnes and China's 7.5 metric tonnes. This shows that United States is emitting significantly more Carbon Dioxide per capita than India and China. Moreover, United States' emissions have been increasing since the 1990s, whereas China's decided to cut its emissions from 2030, and India is expected to peak its emissions around 2040. Therefore, it seems unfair to put India and China on the same pedestal as the United States and ask them to confront their emissions when United States itself is emitting more than anyone else.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Moving on to case studies, let's take the example of solar power. India's approach to sustainable development has been different from that of the United States. India has pledged to produce 40% of its energy from non-fossil fuels by 2030. Currently, India is the world's third-largest producer of solar power. Recently, India successfully launched a satellite entirely powered by solar energy. This shows India's commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and transitioning towards renewable energy. On the other hand, United States' approach towards renewable energy has not been as proactive. In the past, the United States has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, which set a universal target for reducing emissions, and has reduced the funding for renewable energy projects. Therefore, it seems unreasonable for the United States to blame India and China for the environmental crisis when they are taking steps to reduce their emissions and promote renewable energy.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Lastly, let's evaluate Nikki Haley's tweet in three points. Firstly, the United States should take responsibility for emitting the most Carbon Dioxide historically and work towards reducing its emissions. Secondly, it is unfair to ask India and China to confront their emissions when they are taking steps to reduce it. Thirdly, we need to work together as a global community to combat climate change, and blaming each other will not solve the problem.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, Nikki Haley's tweet claiming India and China as top polluters seems like a misguided attempt to shift the blame from the United States. The United States is historically responsible for emitting the most Carbon Dioxide, and it needs to take responsibility for it. India and China are working towards reducing their emissions, and it is unfair to put them on the same pedestal as the United States. We need to work together to tackle climate change and not indulge in blame games.</p>
