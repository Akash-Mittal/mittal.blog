  <p>The budget announcement of Pakistan for the fiscal year 2023-24 has surprised many with a whopping Rs 1.8 trillion allocated for defence. This is a significant increase of 8.3% compared to the previous year's allocation. While the country is grappling with a dwindling economy and inflation, the government has prioritized the defence sector.</p><!--Examples with Case Studies-->
  <h2>Why is the Government Prioritizing Defence Budget?</h2>
  <p>The Pakistani government has cited increasing national security challenges and ongoing conflicts with India and Afghanistan as the primary reasons behind increasing the defence budget. The country has been facing terrorist attacks, cross-border shelling, and insurgency, which are a threat to both the citizens and the military. The tensions with India over the long-standing Kashmir conflict have also been a significant factor behind the budget allocation. In February 2022, the Indian Air Force carried out airstrikes on a terrorist camp in Balakot, Pakistan, which escalated the already volatile situation between the two countries.</p>
  <p>Moreover, the Chinese-Pakistani Economic Corridor (CPEC) project has also contributed to the defence budget allocation. The project involves the construction of infrastructure, including highways, railways, and pipelines, to link the two countries. The project is a part of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and aims to create economic opportunities in Pakistan. However, India has raised concerns over China's increasing influence in the region, and this has led to heightened tensions.</p>
  <p>Despite the government's justification, many economists and analysts have criticized the budget allocation, citing the country's economic woes. Pakistan's economy has been struggling with inflation, unemployment, and a trade deficit. The country has also been seeking a bailout from the International Monetary Fund to address its economic challenges.</p><!--Conclusion-->
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The decision to allocate a significant portion of the budget to defence is a contentious issue. While the government has to prioritize national security, it is equally important to address economic challenges. The government must ensure that the budget allocation is transparent and is utilized effectively to improve the military's capabilities. It is also essential to continue diplomatic efforts to resolve conflicts with neighbouring countries and, in the long run, to strengthen the country's economy.</p><!--Hashtags-->
