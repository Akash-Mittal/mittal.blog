  <p></p>
  <p>The year was 2015, and Delhi was choking. A layer of smog had descended over the city, obscuring visibility and rendering the air unbreathable. The smell of burning plastic, diesel fumes, and dust permeated the air, causing residents to suffer from burning eyes, hacking coughs, and a range of other respiratory ailments. The crisis was so severe that schools were closed, construction projects were halted, and emergency measures were put in place to improve air quality.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This scenario is not unique to Delhi. Across India, air pollution has reached alarming levels, with 14 Indian cities featuring among the top 20 most polluted cities in the world, according to a report published by IQAir. In fact, India is the eighth most polluted country in the world. The situation is dire, but the good news is that it is not irreversible. With the right measures in place, Indian cities can improve air quality and protect public health.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The case for action: Evidence from Mumbai</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Mumbai is one of the most polluted cities in India, with an Air Quality Index (AQI) that regularly exceeds safe levels. The impact of air pollution on public health in Mumbai is evident in the numbers. In a study conducted by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), it was found that respiratory ailments such as asthma, bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were on the rise in the city. Children were particularly vulnerable, with asthma rates among children aged 6-14 years nearly doubling in the past decade. These alarming statistics highlight the urgent need for action.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Mumbai has taken steps to address the issue by implementing a series of measures to improve air quality. For example, the Maharashtra government has launched a â€˜Clean Air Initiative' which targets mobile sources of pollution such as vehicular emissions. The initiative has promoted electric vehicles and the use of compressed natural gas in public transport. Additionally, Mumbai's civic body has urged construction companies to adopt eco-friendly practices such as using wet-mopping techniques to reduce dust pollution. These measures have resulted in a 20-30% reduction in air pollution levels in the city.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The path forward: A three-pronged approach</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Based on the experiences of Mumbai and other Indian cities, a three-pronged approach is needed to tackle air pollution:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Strengthen regulations: The Indian government must pass stronger regulations to control emissions from industries, vehicles, and other sources. This will require tough enforcement, including stringent penalties for non-compliance. The government should also set up monitoring systems to measure air quality across the country.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Promote cleaner technology: Encouraging the use of cleaner technology is vital to reduce emissions. This can be done by incentivizing the use of electric vehicles, promoting the use of cleaner fuels, and encouraging the adoption of renewable energy sources such as solar power.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Public awareness and engagement: Public education and engagement are critical to create a culture of responsible citizenship. Air pollution is not just a government problem; it is a problem that affects everyone. Citizens must be educated on the impact of air pollution on their health and the environment, and actively participate in efforts to reduce emissions. The government can leverage social media and other channels to disseminate information and promote citizen engagement.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Air pollution is a multifaceted problem that requires a coordinated effort from governments, citizens, and industry. With the right policies and strategies in place, Indian cities can improve air quality and protect public health. We need to act quickly and decisively to tackle this crisis and ensure that future generations are not condemned to suffer the consequences of our inaction.</p>
