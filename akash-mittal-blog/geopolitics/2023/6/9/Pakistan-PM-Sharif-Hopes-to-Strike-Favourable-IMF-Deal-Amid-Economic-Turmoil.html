  <p></p>
  <p>In the era of modern journalism, the headline is the key to attracting readers to click on articles. A headline should reflect the gist of the news piece, encapsulating the entire context of the story into a word or a line. Press Trust of India (PTI) is a celebrated news organisation known for its crisp and to-the-point headlines. The headline that caught everyone's attention recently involves Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan's Prime Minister, trying to strike a favourable deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) despite the economic hardships Pakistan is facing.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In recent years, Pakistan has been in a constant state of turmoil when it comes to its economy. The country is burdened with foreign and domestic debt and is on the verge of defaulting on its loans. Thus, Sharif's efforts to strike a deal with the IMF will help Pakistan in stabilising its economy in the short term.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Nevertheless, Sharif is well aware that the IMF will only agree to a deal provided certain conditions are met. Fortunately, Pakistan seems to have fulfilled all these conditions. Firstly, Pakistan has embarked on a series of structural adjustments and reforms to streamline its economy. Secondly, the Pakistani government has managed to maintain fiscal discipline and has avoided going overboard with debts. And finally, the country has experienced a significant increase in its foreign reserve level.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One of the biggest challenges that Sharif has faced in his tenure as Pakistan's Prime Minister has been revitalising the economy. Pakistan has struggled under the burden of debt for decades. The IMF provides a viable solution to ease this burden. Thus, a deal with the IMF will offer a way forward for Pakistan, although it remains to be seen how difficult the negotiations will be.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Looking at similar cases, Sri Lanka is a case study that Pakistan could learn from. In 2018, Sri Lanka had to hand over the Hambantota Port to China on a 99-year lease as the country was in no position to pay off its debt. The Sri Lankan government had to negotiate with the Chinese government to mitigate the economic hardships that the country was facing.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another case study is Ghana. The African country was in a similar position as Pakistan, bogged down with debt. The Ghanaian government had to come up with a plan to renegotiate its debts and create fiscal space for economic growth.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, borrowing from the IMF may be a last resort, but the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. The IMF provides developing countries with an opportunity to revitalise their economy, albeit on strict terms. The process of repayment can be more manageable than trying to fend off accumulated debt. Nevertheless, it is vital that the government is transparent about their borrowing and is accountable for any subsequent consequences, including a loss of sovereignty, as happened with Sri Lanka.</p>
