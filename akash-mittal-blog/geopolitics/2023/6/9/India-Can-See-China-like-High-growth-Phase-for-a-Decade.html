   <p>Imagine a country with a young and rapidly growing population, a strong investment and political climate that encourages entrepreneurship, and a government that is taking measures to boost economic growth. If that sounds like China during its high-growth phase, you wouldn't be entirely wrong. But it could also be India in the coming decade.</p>
   <h2>Examples and Case Studies</h2>
   <p>CEA Nageswaran, former chairman of the Madras School of Economics and former member of the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council, believes that India is on the cusp of a China-like high-growth phase. He cites a number of government measures that have set the stage for sustained rapid economic growth, including:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The Goods and Services Tax (GST) which has consolidated multiple taxes into a single tax system, simplifying the tax code and boosting efficiency</li>
    <li>The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) which has streamlined the process of resolving insolvency cases, reducing non-performing assets (NPAs) in the banking system, and improving the overall health of the financial sector</li>
    <li>The Digital India initiative which has promoted the use of technology to improve government services, increase financial inclusion, and create new business opportunities</li>
    <li>The "Make in India" campaign which aims to promote domestic manufacturing and attract foreign investment</li>
   </ul>
   <p>These measures have already begun to bear fruit. India's GDP growth rate has averaged over 7% in recent years, making it one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world. But Nageswaran believes that this is just the beginning.</p>
   <p>He argues that India's large and young population, which is projected to surpass China's by 2027, will provide a strong base for future economic growth. This demographic dividend, combined with the government's efforts to improve infrastructure, create a business-friendly environment, and encourage entrepreneurship, could propel India into a sustained period of rapid economic growth.</p>
   <p>Nageswaran's views are supported by a number of recent studies. McKinsey &amp; Company predicts that India's consumer market will grow from $1.3 trillion in 2020 to $6 trillion in 2030, driven by rising incomes and a growing middle class. The Boston Consulting Group predicts that India's e-commerce market will grow from $30 billion in 2020 to $200 billion in 2026, powered by increased internet penetration and the rise of digital payments.</p>

   <p>India is poised to experience a China-like high-growth phase over the next decade.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The government's measures to support economic growth, including the GST, IBC, and Digital India, have laid the foundation for sustained rapid growth.</li>
    <li>India's large and young population, combined with rising incomes and a growing middle class, will provide a strong base for future economic growth.</li>
    <li>The growth potential of India's consumer and e-commerce markets highlights the country's potential for sustained rapid growth in the coming years.</li>
