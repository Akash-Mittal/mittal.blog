   <p>Cricket is a game of uncertainties and surprises. One minute a team can be cruising to victory, and the next they can be staring down the barrel of defeat. This was the case for India in the World Test Championship final against Australia, where their top order collapsed in spectacular fashion.</p>
   <p>India started the day on 146-3, with captain Virat Kohli and vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane at the crease. However, within the space of two overs, India lost both Kohli and Rahane, as well as Cheteshwar Pujara and Rishabh Pant. It was a stunning display of bowling from the Australians, who exploited the difficult conditions to perfection.</p>
   <p>India's collapse was reminiscent of similar collapses in other matches, where teams have been cruising at one point, only to suddenly crumble under pressure. One such match was the Ashes Test between England and Australia in 2019, where England lost 8 wickets for just 63 runs, despite being in a dominant position earlier in the innings.</p>
   <p>Another example is the India vs New Zealand Test in 2020, where India collapsed from 194-4 to 242 all out, losing 6 wickets for just 48 runs. This collapse cost India the match, as New Zealand went on to win by 10 wickets.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies</h2>
   <h3>England vs Australia, Ashes Test 2019</h3>
   <p>In this match, England were in a strong position, trailing by just 82 runs on the first innings with 4 wickets in hand. However, a sudden collapse saw them lose 8 wickets for just 63 runs, with Stuart Broad taking 5 wickets for just 17 runs. This collapse proved pivotal, as Australia went on to win the match by 185 runs.</p>
   <h3>India vs New Zealand, Test 2020</h3>
   <p>In this match, India were in control, with a lead of 101 runs with 6 wickets in hand. However, a sudden collapse saw them lose 6 wickets for just 48 runs, with Kyle Jamieson taking 5 wickets for just 45 runs. This collapse cost India the match, as New Zealand won by 10 wickets.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>India's collapse against Australia in the WTC final was a reminder of how quickly things can change in cricket. Despite being in control for much of the game, one bad session can leave a team staring down the barrel of defeat. It is a testament to the skill and mental toughness required to succeed at the highest level of the sport.</p>
   <p>However, all is not lost for India. They still have the likes of Rahane and Ravindra Jadeja at the crease, and with the pitch continuing to offer assistance to the bowlers, there is still hope for a comeback. It will require a herculean effort from the Indian batsmen, but in cricket, anything is possible.</p>
