   <p>Security Consultations in Beijing</p>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>The recent security consultations between China, Iran and Pakistan in Beijing have sparked interest and speculation about a new alliance in Asia. With tensions rising globally and the shifting power dynamics, this new partnership could have far-reaching consequences for the region and the world.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Successful Regional Alliances</h2>
   <p>Regional alliances have been an important feature in global politics, providing collective security and economic benefits to their member countries. Some examples of successful regional alliances include:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The European Union (EU) - formed in 1957, the EU has brought together 27 countries in Europe to promote peace, stability and prosperity</li>
    <li>The African Union (AU) - formed in 2002, the AU has 55 member states and has been instrumental in promoting democracy, human rights and economic development</li>
    <li>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) - formed in 1967, ASEAN has 10 member states and has been a key player in regional security, economic cooperation and integration</li>
    <li>The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) - formed in 1949, NATO has been crucial in maintaining collective defense and security against potential threats in Europe and beyond</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Case Studies of China-Iran-Pakistan Cooperation</h2>
   <p>The latest security consultations between China, Iran and Pakistan are not the first instances of cooperation between the three countries. Here are some examples:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) - a game-changer project for Pakistan, CPEC is a collection of infrastructure projects that aim to improve connectivity and trade between the two countries. The construction of the corridor has been heavily financed by China and has the potential to boost Pakistan's economic growth</li>
    <li>The Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline - also known as the Peace Pipeline, this project aims to bring natural gas from Iran to Pakistan, with the potential to extend it to India. The pipeline was first proposed in the 1990s but has faced many geopolitical and economic challenges. Nevertheless, the three countries have continued to express their commitment to the project</li>
    <li>China-Pakistan joint military exercises - the two countries have been conducting joint military exercises since 2011, with the latest one held in 2020. The exercises aim to promote military cooperation and coordination between the two countries, particularly in counter-terrorism and maritime security</li>
    <li>Iran-China strategic partnership - in 2020, Iran and China signed a $400 billion deal to enhance their economic and political ties over the next 25 years. The deal includes cooperation in areas such as energy, infrastructure, defense and technology transfer, and has been described as a strategic partnership between the two countries</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion: Assessing the Implications</h2>
   <p>The new alliance between China, Iran and Pakistan could have several implications for the region and the world:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Increased collective security - the three countries could coordinate their efforts to counter common security threats such as terrorism and extremism, as well as promote stability and respect for sovereignty in the region</li>
    <li>Enhanced economic cooperation - with China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) already connecting the region through infrastructure and trade, the alliance could further boost economic growth and development in the member countries</li>
    <li>Challenges to the existing power structures - the alliance could potentially challenge the dominance of the US and its allies in the region, particularly with the US retreating from its global leadership role in recent years</li>
   </ul>
