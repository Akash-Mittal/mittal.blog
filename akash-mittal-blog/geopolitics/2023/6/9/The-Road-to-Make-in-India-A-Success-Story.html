   <p>Fun Zoo Toys is a small manufacturing company located in the heart of India. The company started its operations in 1979 as a family business, producing heart-shaped cushions and "Little Ganesha" dolls.</p>
   <p>Over the years, Fun Zoo Toys has grown to become one of the nation's major manufacturers of fluffy toys. Their range of products has expanded to include animals, birds, and other characters, all made with the highest quality materials and attention to detail.</p>
   <p>What sets Fun Zoo Toys apart from its competitors is its commitment to making everything in India. The company takes pride in being part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambitious "Make-in-India" campaign, which aims to turn India into a global manufacturing hub.</p>
   <h2>The Road to Make-in-India</h2>
   <p>The road to Modi's ambitious Make-in-India goal runs through China, the world's largest manufacturing nation. For years, China has been the go-to destination for global companies looking to manufacture their products at low cost.</p>
   <p>However, rising wages and a slowing Chinese economy have made many companies look for alternatives, and India is emerging as a promising destination. With its large and growing middle class, skilled workforce, and favorable policies, India is attracting attention from investors and manufacturers alike.</p>
   <p>Under Modi's leadership, the Indian government has implemented a number of policies to encourage domestic manufacturing and attract foreign investment. These policies include tax incentives, streamlined regulations, and infrastructure development.</p>
   <p>One of the flagship programs of the Make-in-India campaign is the establishment of industrial corridors – dedicated zones for manufacturing – across the country. These corridors provide businesses with the necessary infrastructure, such as water, power, and transportation, to set up and operate efficiently.</p>
   <h2>Examples with case studies</h2>
   <p>Fun Zoo Toys is just one example of the success that can be achieved through the Make-in-India campaign. Here are some more case studies of companies that have set up operations in India:</p>
   <p><span class="bold">Ford Motor Company:</span> Ford has been manufacturing cars in India since 1998 and has invested over $2 billion in its Indian operations. In 2019, the company opened a new state-of-the-art factory in Sanand, Gujarat, which is one of the largest automotive manufacturing facilities in the world.</p>
   <p><span class="bold">Samsung Electronics:</span> Samsung has been making smartphones in India since 2007 and has invested over $500 million in its Indian operations. In 2018, the company opened the world's largest mobile phone factory in Noida, Uttar Pradesh, which has the capacity to produce 120 million smartphones per year.</p>
   <p><span class="bold">Foxconn:</span> Foxconn, the Taiwanese electronics manufacturer that assembles iPhones for Apple, has been expanding its operations in India. In 2019, the company opened a new iPhone assembly plant in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, and is planning to invest $1 billion in its Indian operations over the next few years.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion in 3 points</h2>
   <p><span class="bold">1. Make-in-India is a key initiative of the Indian government to increase domestic manufacturing and make India a global manufacturing hub.</span> The campaign aims to attract foreign investment and provide businesses with a favorable environment for manufacturing.</p>
   <p><span class="bold">2. India has many advantages as a manufacturing destination, including its large and growing middle class, skilled workforce, and favorable policies.</span> The establishment of industrial corridors across the country has also provided businesses with the necessary infrastructure to operate efficiently.</p>
   <p><span class="bold">3. The success of Make-in-India can be seen in the many companies that have set up operations in India, including Ford, Samsung, and Foxconn. These companies have invested billions of dollars in India and are contributing to the growth of the Indian economy.</span></p>
