    <h2>A Growing Market</h2>

One of the most notable examples is Xiaomi, the Chinese smartphone maker that has become a household name in India. Xiaomi currently commands a 27% market share in India, and the company is continuing to expand its presence in the country. They have already established two manufacturing plants in India, and have plans to open more. Other Chinese tech firms, such as Alibaba and Tencent, have also made significant investments in India.</p>
