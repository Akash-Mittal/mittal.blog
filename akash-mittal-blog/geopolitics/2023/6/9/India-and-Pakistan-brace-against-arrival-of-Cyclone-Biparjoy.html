  <h1>India and Pakistan brace against arrival of Cyclone Biparjoy</h1></br> <img src="images/India-and-Pakistan-brace-against-arrival-of-Cyclone-Biparjoy.jpeg" alt="+India-and-Pakistan-brace-against-arrival-of-Cyclone-Biparjoy+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.laprensalatina.com/india-pakistan-brace-against-arrival-of-cyclone-biparjoy/" target="_blank" href="https://www.laprensalatina.com/india-pakistan-brace-against-arrival-of-cyclone-biparjoy/" rel="noopener">https://www.laprensalatina.com/india-pakistan-brace-against-arrival-of-cyclone-biparjoy/</a></span></h5>
  <p></p>
  <p>Cyclone Biparjoy is predicted to hit India and Pakistan in the coming week, and authorities in both countries are taking precautionary measures to minimize the potential loss of lives and property. Strong winds, heavy rains, and floods expected from Cyclone Biparjoy pose a great danger to both countries, which are still grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>India, which has already been battered by Cyclone Amphan in May this year, has deployed teams of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) in the coastal states of West Bengal and Odisha. The NDRF teams are equipped with boats, rescue equipment, and medical supplies to respond to any emergency situation.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The Odisha government has also evacuated more than 100,000 people from low-lying areas along the coast to safer places in schools and cyclone shelters. The state government has also set up control rooms, stockpiled food, and alerted emergency services to be on standby.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Pakistan, on the other hand, has also issued a warning to fishermen, sailors, and coastal residents to avoid the sea and move to safer locations. The Pakistan Meteorological Department has predicted strong winds and heavy rainfall in coastal areas of Balochistan, Sindh, and Makran divisions from 6 to 9 November.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has activated its emergency response plans to coordinate the relief efforts in case of any disaster. The NDMA has also advised the provincial governments to take necessary measures to minimize the risks of damage and loss of lives.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The arrival of Cyclone Biparjoy is a reminder of the increasing frequency of extreme weather events due to climate change. The Indian Ocean has witnessed a rise in the number of cyclones in recent years, and these storms have been getting more severe and more destructive.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>India and Pakistan are not alone in facing the threats of climate change. The entire world is experiencing the adverse impacts of global warming, which is leading to more frequent and severe natural disasters, including floods, droughts, heatwaves, and hurricanes.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>According to a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global temperatures have already risen by 1℃ above pre-industrial levels, and the average temperature is projected to rise by 1.5℃ between 2030 and 2052 if no action is taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The consequences of such a temperature rise are catastrophic, including melting glaciers, rising sea levels, destruction of marine ecosystems, desertification, food and water scarcity, and displacement of millions of people.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>To avoid such catastrophic events, urgent and bold action is needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a low-carbon economy. This requires a global effort, with every country, business, and individual contributing to the reduction of emissions.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, Cyclone Biparjoy is a wake-up call for India, Pakistan, and the world to take climate change seriously and act with urgency to prevent the worst impacts on our planet and humanity. We need to invest in renewable energy, promote sustainable agriculture, transportation, and construction, and adapt to the inevitable consequences of global warming.</p>
