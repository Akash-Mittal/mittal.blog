   <p>On a sunny day in March 2021, high-level officials from China, Iran and Pakistan gathered in Beijing for a series of security consultations. The meeting marked the first step in the establishment of a new alliance in Asia, aimed at enhancing cooperation in military, intelligence, and counter-terrorism matters.</p>
   <p>As tensions rise in the region due to geopolitical rivalries, terrorism threats, and economic challenges, China, Iran and Pakistan are turning to each other to pursue their shared interests and protect their national security. The timing and the scope of the trilateral partnership have raised many questions and concerns, both inside and outside the region. However, the three countries seem determined to move forward with their plans and overcome the obstacles that lie ahead.</p>
   <h2>Case studies</h2>
   <p>In order to understand the motivations, aspirations and challenges of the China-Iran-Pakistan alliance, let us look at some case studies:</p>
   <h3>Case Study 1: Economic Interests in Pakistan</h3>
   <p>China and Pakistan have long enjoyed a close economic partnership, centered on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The CPEC is a $62 billion infrastructure project that aims to connect China's western region to Pakistan's southern port of Gwadar, via a network of highways, railways, pipelines, and power plants. The project is expected to boost Pakistan's economy, create jobs, and provide an alternate route for China's energy imports from the Persian Gulf.</p>
   <p>However, the CPEC has faced various challenges, including security threats from militants, protests by local communities, and criticism from India and the United States. Iran's participation in the project could potentially mitigate some of these issues, by providing a shorter and safer route for Chinese goods and energy supplies, and by deploying its own security forces to protect the corridor.</p>
   <h3>Case Study 2: Strategic Interests in Iran</h3>
   <p>Iran occupies a pivotal position in the Middle East, due to its geostrategic location, its vast energy resources, and its influence on Shia communities across the region. Iran is also facing multiple challenges, such as economic sanctions, political isolation, and sectarian tensions. China and Pakistan see in Iran a valuable partner that can help them achieve their strategic goals, by providing a major market for Chinese goods, a source of energy for the region, and a buffer against extremist groups.</p>
   <p>However, Iran's relations with the international community, particularly with the United States and Israel, remain strained, and its nuclear program continues to be a point of contention. China and Pakistan have to balance their interests in Iran with their diplomatic commitments to the global order, and avoid getting involved in any conflicts that could jeopardize their own security.</p>
   <h3>Case Study 3: Security Interests in China</h3>
   <p>China is the dominant power in East Asia, and is increasingly assertive in challenging the United States' influence in the region. China faces multiple security threats, such as territorial disputes in the South China Sea, the rise of separatist movements in Xinjiang and Tibet, and the proliferation of terrorism and extremism. China seeks to enhance its military capabilities, modernize its defense industry, and expand its network of allies and partners.</p>
   <p>Iran and Pakistan offer China an opportunity to achieve these goals, by providing a counterbalance to India and the United States, by cooperating in joint military exercises and intelligence sharing, and by supporting China's Belt and Road Initiative. However, China has to be careful not to alienate its existing partners or provoke any regional conflicts, which could harm its long-term interests.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The China-Iran-Pakistan alliance is a complex and evolving phenomenon, shaped by various political, economic, and security factors. The alliance has the potential to bring significant benefits to all three countries, in terms of trade, energy, and regional stability. However, the alliance also faces many challenges, such as conflicting interests, regional rivalries, and external pressure. The success of the alliance will depend on the ability of China, Iran, and Pakistan to balance their own interests with the interests of the region and the world, and to cooperate effectively in tackling the common challenges they face.</p>
