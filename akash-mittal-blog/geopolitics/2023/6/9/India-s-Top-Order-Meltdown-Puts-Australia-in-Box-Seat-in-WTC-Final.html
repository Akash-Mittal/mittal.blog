    <p>Cricket is a game of uncertainties and that's what makes it so fascinating. One moment, a team can be cruising along and the next moment, they can be in all sorts of trouble. This was the case for India in the World Test Championship final against Australia.</p>
    <p>In the morning session on Day 2, the Indian openers, Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill got off to a solid start, putting up 62 runs for the first wicket. However, it all fell apart once Rohit fell for 34. The Indian top order crumbled under pressure from the Australian bowlers, with Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane all failing to make an impact.</p>
    <p>This is not the first time that India's top order has failed in a big game. In the 2017 Champions Trophy final against Pakistan, India's top three batsmen fell for just three runs, putting a lot of pressure on the middle order. Similarly, in the 2019 World Cup semi-final against New Zealand, India's top three batsmen fell for just one run, again putting pressure on the middle order.</p>
    <p>It is important for a team to have a strong top order that can provide a solid foundation for the middle order to build on. When the top order fails, it puts immense pressure on the middle and lower order to salvage the situation. Here are some case studies to illustrate this point:</p>
    <h2>Case Study 1: India vs Pakistan, Champions Trophy Final 2017</h2>
    <p>In the 2017 Champions Trophy final, India won the toss and elected to field first. Pakistan got off to a flyer, with the openers putting up a century stand. However, the Indian bowlers fought back and restricted Pakistan to 338/4 in 50 overs. India needed a good start to chase down the target but that was not to be. Indian top three batsmen (Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli) fell for just three runs, giving Pakistan the upper hand. India eventually managed 158, losing the match by 180 runs.</p>
    <h2>Case Study 2: India vs New Zealand, World Cup Semi-final 2019</h2>
    <p>In the 2019 World Cup semi-final, India won the toss and elected to bat first. The top three batsmen (Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul and Virat Kohli) fell for just one run, putting immense pressure on the middle order. India eventually managed 221, which was not enough as New Zealand chased it down with relative ease. India lost the match by 18 runs.</p>
    <p>These examples highlight the importance of a strong top order in a big game. India's top order needs to take responsibility and provide a solid foundation for the middle order to build on. The match is still not over and India can still make a comeback but it will require a herculean effort from the middle and lower order.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>India's top order meltdown has put Australia in a box seat in the World Test Championship final. The importance of a strong top order in a big game cannot be overstated. India has a strong middle and lower order but they cannot do it alone. The top order needs to take responsibility and provide a solid foundation for the rest of the team to build on. It is not over yet and India has the ability to make a comeback but it will require a collective effort from the entire team.</p>

  <p><em>Once upon a time, in cricketing histories, we have seen some great comebacks from teams. But, when a team slips off the track from the start, it can be very difficult for that team to make a significant come back. This is what happened in India's first innings of WTC final against Australia.</em></p>
  <p>India's top order meltdown puts Australia in the box seat in the WTC final. Going into the first day of the final, both teams looked quite evenly matched. But, things started to change from the very first ball of the match when the Indian skipper Virat Kohli was caught out by the Australian skipper Tim Paine on the very first delivery of the match.</p>
  <p>The Indian batsmen then kept on losing wickets one after another, and at one point, they were tottering at 146 for 6. It was then when the vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane took the responsibility on his shoulders and played a brilliant knock of 79 runs. But, unfortunately, he did not get much support from the other end, and India was bundled out for just 217.</p>
  <p>The Indian cricket team is known to bounce back from these types of situations, but it will be a tough ask for them in these conditions.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies</h2>
  <p>This is not the first time when India has struggled with their opening pair in overseas conditions. They have suffered similar issues in the past, and it has cost them a few big matches.</p>
  <p>For instance, in the England tour of 2018, India lost the five-match test series 4-1. The opening pair of Murali Vijay and Shikhar Dhawan failed to provide India with a solid foundation, and as a result, India found themselves on the back foot in almost all the matches of the series. The Indian team management had to bring in KL Rahul, who did provide some stability, but it was too late by then.</p>
  <p>Similarly, in the South Africa tour of 2018, India lost the first two test matches of the three-match series due to their opening woes. Once again, the opening pair failed to provide India with a good start, and as a result, India always found themselves chasing the game. India did make a comeback in the final test, but it was too late, and they lost the series.</p>
  <p>These are just a couple of examples, but there have been many instances when India has struggled with their opening pair in overseas conditions.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The Indian cricket team is known for its resilience, and they have bounced back from tough situations in the past. But, it will be a tough ask for them to recover from their top-order meltdown in this WTC final against Australia.</p>
  <p>It is imperative that the Indian batsmen show some character and provide a good partnership to get India out of trouble. They have some good players in the team, and if they can click together as a unit, then there's no reason why they can't give Australia a run for their money.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, India needs to get their act together and put up a good show with the bat. They need to recover from their top-order collapse and show some fighting spirit to make a comeback in this WTC final.</p>
