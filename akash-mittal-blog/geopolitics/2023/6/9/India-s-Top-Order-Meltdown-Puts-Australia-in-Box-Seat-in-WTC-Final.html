    <p>Cricket is a game of uncertainties and that's what makes it so fascinating. One moment, a team can be cruising along and the next moment, they can be in all sorts of trouble. This was the case for India in the World Test Championship final against Australia.</p>
    <p>In the morning session on Day 2, the Indian openers, Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill got off to a solid start, putting up 62 runs for the first wicket. However, it all fell apart once Rohit fell for 34. The Indian top order crumbled under pressure from the Australian bowlers, with Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane all failing to make an impact.</p>
    <p>This is not the first time that India's top order has failed in a big game. In the 2017 Champions Trophy final against Pakistan, India's top three batsmen fell for just three runs, putting a lot of pressure on the middle order. Similarly, in the 2019 World Cup semi-final against New Zealand, India's top three batsmen fell for just one run, again putting pressure on the middle order.</p>
    <p>It is important for a team to have a strong top order that can provide a solid foundation for the middle order to build on. When the top order fails, it puts immense pressure on the middle and lower order to salvage the situation. Here are some case studies to illustrate this point:</p>
    <h2>Case Study 1: India vs Pakistan, Champions Trophy Final 2017</h2>
    <p>In the 2017 Champions Trophy final, India won the toss and elected to field first. Pakistan got off to a flyer, with the openers putting up a century stand. However, the Indian bowlers fought back and restricted Pakistan to 338/4 in 50 overs. India needed a good start to chase down the target but that was not to be. Indian top three batsmen (Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli) fell for just three runs, giving Pakistan the upper hand. India eventually managed 158, losing the match by 180 runs.</p>
    <h2>Case Study 2: India vs New Zealand, World Cup Semi-final 2019</h2>
    <p>In the 2019 World Cup semi-final, India won the toss and elected to bat first. The top three batsmen (Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul and Virat Kohli) fell for just one run, putting immense pressure on the middle order. India eventually managed 221, which was not enough as New Zealand chased it down with relative ease. India lost the match by 18 runs.</p>
    <p>These examples highlight the importance of a strong top order in a big game. India's top order needs to take responsibility and provide a solid foundation for the middle order to build on. The match is still not over and India can still make a comeback but it will require a herculean effort from the middle and lower order.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>India's top order meltdown has put Australia in a box seat in the World Test Championship final. The importance of a strong top order in a big game cannot be overstated. India has a strong middle and lower order but they cannot do it alone. The top order needs to take responsibility and provide a solid foundation for the rest of the team to build on. It is not over yet and India has the ability to make a comeback but it will require a collective effort from the entire team.</p>
