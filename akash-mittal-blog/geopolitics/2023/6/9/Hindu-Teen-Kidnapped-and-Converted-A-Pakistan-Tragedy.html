  <p>It was just like any other day in the life of the teenage Arzoo Raja from Karachi, Pakistan.</p>
  <p>But little did she know that she was going to become a victim of religious persecution because of her faith.</p>
  <h2>The Kidnapping</h2>
  <p>On October 13, 2020, three armed men entered Arzoo Raja's home and looted gold ornaments. But that was not all. They kidnapped the 13-year-old Hindu girl at gunpoint.</p>
  <p>As the news of her kidnapping spread, her family and friends were in a state of shock and despair. They were worried about her safety and whereabouts.</p>
  <h2>The Conversion and Marriage</h2>
  <p>Days later, the kidnappers revealed that Arzoo Raja had been forcibly converted to Islam and married off to a 44-year-old Muslim man named Ali Azhar. He claimed that the marriage was done with her consent.</p>
  <p>However, her family and supporters were skeptical about the authenticity of this claim. They believed that she was coerced into converting and marrying a man three times her age.</p>
  <h2>The Tutor's Role</h2>
  <p>It later emerged that Ali Azhar was not only a friend of the kidnappers but also the tutor of Arzoo Raja. This raised serious questions about his conduct and involvement in her abduction and conversion.</p>
  <p>It is alleged that he used his influence and authority as a tutor to facilitate her kidnapping and conversion to Islam.</p>
  <h2>The Impact</h2>
  <p>The abduction and conversion of Arzoo Raja has sparked outrage and protests in Pakistan and around the world. Many activists and human rights organizations have condemned this act of religious persecution and demanded justice for Arzoo and her family.</p>
  <p>This incident has brought to light the plight of religious minorities in Pakistan, who are often victims of such heinous crimes. It also underscores the need for the Pakistani government to take measures to protect the rights of all its citizens, regardless of their religion.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The case of Arzoo Raja is not an isolated incident. It is a reflection of the deep-seated prejudices and biases against religious minorities in Pakistan.</p>
  <p>It is imperative that the Pakistani government takes concrete steps to safeguard the rights and freedoms of all its citizens, especially those who belong to marginalized and vulnerable communities.</p>
  <p>We need to raise our voice and stand in solidarity with victims like Arzoo Raja to ensure that justice is served, and such acts of intolerance and bigotry are not repeated in the future.</p>
