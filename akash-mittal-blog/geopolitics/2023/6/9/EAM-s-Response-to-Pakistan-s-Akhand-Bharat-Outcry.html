  <p>Recently, there has been a row erupted over the Akhand Bharat mural in the Indian Parliament. Many neighbouring nations, including Pakistan, have raised objections to the map of India as depicted in the new Parliament. In a press conference, EAM S Jaishankar was asked about these objections, to which he responded, "Pakistan doesn't have the capacity to understand."</p>
  <h2>Why Can't Pakistan Understand?</h2>
  <p>Understanding the root cause of Pakistan's inability to understand requires a deep dive into the country's history, politics, and psychology. However, there are a few key factors that contribute to this lack of understanding:</p>
  <h3>1. Historical Hostility</h3>
  <p>India and Pakistan have a long history of conflict dating back to their partition in 1947. The two countries have fought three wars, in addition to numerous smaller conflicts. This historical hostility has created a deep mistrust and animosity between the two nations, making it difficult for Pakistan to view India's actions in a positive light.</p>
  <p>For example, during the Kargil War in 1999, Pakistan attempted to seize control of Indian territory in Kashmir, resulting in the deaths of thousands of soldiers and civilians on both sides. This conflict left a deep scar on the Indian psyche and has made it difficult for India to trust Pakistan. Similarly, for Pakistan, India's continued occupation of Kashmir is a constant reminder of historical injustice, making it difficult for them to view India's actions positively.</p>
  <h3>2. Political Instability</h3>
  <p>Pakistan has a long history of political instability, with frequent military coups, assassinations, and civil unrest. This instability has made it difficult for Pakistan to focus on matters of development and governance, and instead has led to a focus on military and strategic concerns.</p>
  <p>This focus on military and strategic concerns has led to a disproportionate amount of resources being allocated to the military, at the expense of social and economic development. As a result, Pakistan lags behind India in many social and economic indicators, making it difficult for them to compete with India on the global stage.</p>
  <h3>3. Psychological Factors</h3>
  <p>Finally, there are psychological factors that contribute to Pakistan's inability to understand India's actions. These include a sense of victimhood, a persecution complex, and a deep-seated fear of Indian hegemony.</p>
  <p>For example, Pakistan sees India's growing role in the region as a threat to its own security, leading to a sense of paranoia and fear. Similarly, Pakistan's obsession with Kashmir, which they see as an issue of national identity, has made it difficult for them to view India's actions in a dispassionate and objective manner.</p>
  <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The lack of understanding between India and Pakistan is a complex issue with no easy solutions. However, it is important for both nations to continue to engage in dialogue and focus on issues of mutual benefit, such as trade and economic development.</p>
  <p>Additionally, both countries need to work towards resolving their historical grievances and healing the wounds of the past. Until these issues are addressed, it is unlikely that they will be able to move towards a more peaceful and cooperative relationship.</p>
