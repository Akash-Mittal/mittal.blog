   <p>India is facing a major drug threat from across its border with Pakistan. While tensions between the two countries are mainly centred on terrorism, a new kind of threat has emerged that is proving to be equally dangerous - drug trafficking.</p>
   <p>According to India TV, Punjab Governor VP Singh Purohit has backed a "surgical strike" on Pakistan for pushing drugs into India. The Pakistani establishment is allegedly trying to "make our next generation drug addicts", says Purohit, who has received complaints that drugs have reached schools and students are becoming addicts, stealing money from home to support their addiction.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Pakistan's Drug Pushing Tactics</h2>
   <p>Pakistan is not just pushing drugs across the border into India but is also using ingenious methods to smuggle in drugs.</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Through Drones:</strong> Recently, Indian security agencies caught a drone attempting to drop a weapon and drugs ahead of elections in Punjab. Security forces believe that Pakistan-based smugglers are using drones to drop consignments along the border.</li>
    <li><strong>Through Waterways:</strong> The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) recently revealed that drugs are being smuggled into India from Pakistan through the sea route. Drugs are trafficked from coves in Pakistan's Sindh province to Gujarat and Maharashtra via sea routes.</li>
    <li><strong>Through Poppy Cultivation:</strong> Pakistan has been cultivating poppy on a large scale for the past few years, which it then smuggles into India. The drug is then used to manufacture and supply opium and heroin to drug addicts.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Case Studies on the Impact of Drug Trafficking on India</h2>
   <p>The impact of drug trafficking on India is alarming. Drugs have reached schools and colleges, with students as young as 12 reportedly being involved in drug abuse. Here are some case studies that highlight the impact of drug addiction in India:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Case Study 1:</strong> In 2018, a government survey revealed that over 3 crore Indians were using drugs, with Punjab recording the highest number of drug addicts. Addiction to opiates had become so rampant that some drug users were selling their children to buy drugs.</li>
    <li><strong>Case Study 2:</strong> In 2019, a Class 12 student in Punjab committed suicide after his parents scolded him for drug addiction. The boy's uncle was a drug peddler.</li>
    <li><strong>Case Study 3:</strong> In 2020, a mother in Punjab wrote an emotional letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking help to save her son who was addicted to drugs. The boy had become a drug addict after his friends introduced him to drugs in school.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>Pakistan's drug pushing tactics have wreaked havoc in India, destroying its next generation. The Indian government needs to take strong action to tackle this menace, such as more effective checkposts along the border, better surveillance and intelligence-gathering, stricter laws to punish drug traffickers, and better rehabilitation and counselling facilities for drug addicts. It is only by working together that India and Pakistan can overcome this new threat that imperils the future of both nations.</p>
