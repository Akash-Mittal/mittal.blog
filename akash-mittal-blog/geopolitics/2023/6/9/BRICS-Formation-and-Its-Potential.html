  <p>In 2001, an economist from Goldman Sachs coined the term "BRIC" to represent the four nations with the greatest potential for growth in the 21st century – Brazil, Russia, India, and China. The term quickly gained traction and the four countries began to realize the immense benefits of cooperating with each other to achieve their goals. In 2010, South Africa joined to form BRICS, a formidable intergovernmental organization with huge economic potential.</p><!-- Achievements -->

   <h4>India and China – Increasing Cooperation</h4>
   <p>India and China, the two largest members of BRICS, have had a history of strained relations but have recently increased cooperation through economic agreements. In 2020, India and China signed a new trade agreement aimed at balancing trade between the two countries, which had previously been in favor of China. This cooperation has opened up avenues for increased trade and investment between the two countries, leading to economic growth for both.</p>

   <h4>Russia and Brazil – Energy Cooperation</h4>
   <p>Russia and Brazil, two of the largest energy producers in the world, have established a strategic partnership for energy cooperation. The two countries have been working together to invest in oil exploration, refine crude oil, and develop natural gas resources. This partnership has not only increased trade between the two countries but has also led to diversification of energy sources and reduction of reliance on a single supplier for both countries.</p>
