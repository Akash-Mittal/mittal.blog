  <p>Recent discussions about whether or not to open a NATO liaison office in Japan showcase that the alliance is not united on how to respond to a more assertive China, writes Janne Leino.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
  
  <p>In 2015, NATO opened a liaison office in the United Arab Emirates to support the alliance's strategic partnership with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). The GCC is a regional political and economic union of six Arab states that are facing security challenges, including the rise of ISIS and other extremist groups in the Middle East. The liaison office serves as a vital link between NATO and the GCC, promoting political dialogue, information exchange, and cooperation on issues of mutual interest.</p>
  <h2>Case Study: ASEAN</h2>
  <p>Establishing a NATO liaison office in China would be a strategic move for the alliance, particularly in light of China's increasing influence in the Asia-Pacific region. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) provides a useful case study. In 2003, NATO opened a liaison office in Singapore to establish close relationships with the ASEAN member states and enhance military-to-military cooperation in the region. The office has been successful in promoting dialogue and cooperation between NATO and ASEAN in areas such as counter-terrorism, disaster relief, and maritime security.<sup>[2]</sup></p>
  <h2>The Benefits of a NATO Office in China</h2>
  <p>There are several reasons why NATO should aim to establish an office in China:</p>
  <ol>
   <li><strong>Promoting Dialogue:</strong> A NATO office in China would serve as a platform for political dialogue and information exchange between China and the alliance. This would be particularly important given the current tensions between NATO and China over issues such as the South China Sea and Taiwan.</li>
   <li><strong>Strengthening Cooperation:</strong> A NATO office in China would facilitate military-to-military cooperation between NATO and China on issues of mutual interest such as counter-terrorism, cyber security, and climate change.</li>
   <li><strong>Addressing Security Challenges:</strong> A NATO office in China could help address security challenges in the region, including those related to North Korea's nuclear program and the rise of extremist groups such as ISIS in Southeast Asia.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Establishing a NATO liaison office in China would be a significant step towards strengthening the alliance's engagement with Asia and promoting peace and stability in the region. A NATO office in China would provide a platform for political dialogue, strengthen military-to-military cooperation, and address security challenges in the region. It is time for NATO to take a proactive approach to its relationship with China and establish an official presence in the country.</p>
