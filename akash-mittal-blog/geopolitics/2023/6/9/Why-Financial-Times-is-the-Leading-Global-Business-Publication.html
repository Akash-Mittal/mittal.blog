    <p>When I started my career in finance, my mentor told me that reading the Financial Times is the single most important thing I can do to stay ahead of the curve. I was skeptical at first, as I had never been a big reader and assumed that everything I needed to know could be found online. But after a few weeks of reading the Financial Times, I was hooked. I started to notice how much more informed and confident I felt, and how much more I understood about the global financial markets. From that point on, I made reading the Financial Times a daily habit, and it has been one of the best decisions I ever made.</p>
