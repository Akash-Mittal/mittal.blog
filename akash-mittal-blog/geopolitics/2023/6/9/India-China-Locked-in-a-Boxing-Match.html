  <p>It was a bright and sunny day in the year 1962, when Indian and Chinese troops were locked in a brutal war along the Himalayan border. The conflict lasted for a month and ended with China emerging as the clear winner. While the war may have ended, the scars it left behind are still fresh in the minds of Indians. Fast forward to 2021, and India and China are once again engaged in a bitter fight, this time not on the battlefield but in the realm of politics and diplomacy.</p>
  <h2>The Doklam Stand-Off</h2>
  <p>In 2017, China attempted to build a road in the Doklam region, a disputed territory located between Bhutan and China. India, which has close diplomatic ties with Bhutan, saw this as a threat to its security and intervened by sending troops to the region. China responded by sending its own troops, and for nearly three months, the two sides were locked in a tense standoff. Finally, the issue was resolved after both sides agreed to withdraw their troops.</p>
  <h2>The Maldives Crisis</h2>
  <p>In 2018, the Maldives underwent a political crisis when its president, Abdulla Yameen, declared a state of emergency, resulting in widespread protests and arrests. India, which has historically maintained strong ties with the Maldives, expressed its concern over the situation and even sent ships to evacuate Indian nationals from the country. However, China saw an opportunity in the crisis and openly supported Yameen's regime, undermining India's influence in the region.</p>
  <h2>The Nepal Kalapani Border Dispute</h2>
  <p>In 2020, Nepal released a new map that showed a disputed region of Kalapani as part of its own territory, a move that was met with strong opposition from India. The region, which is located at the tri-junction of India, Nepal, and China, has been a source of tension between India and Nepal for several decades. China, which has been looking to expand its influence in Nepal, has been supporting Nepal's claim to the region.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The three incidents mentioned above demonstrate how China has been using its influence to create tensions between India and its neighboring countries. Beijing has been playing a game of divide and rule, by targeting India's allies and creating rifts in the regional security architecture. India needs to be more proactive in its diplomacy and engage with its neighbors to address their concerns, rather than leaving the field open for China to exploit.</p>
