  <p>Recently, an uproar was caused when a mural of Akhand Bharat was put up in the Indian Parliament. Akhand Bharat, meaning "Undivided India" is a concept that envisions the reunification of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh into one country.</p>
  <p>India's External Affairs Minister, S Jaishankar, responded to objections raised by neighboring nations, particularly Pakistan, about the map of India depicted in the Parliament mural. In a press conference, he stated that "Pakistan doesn't have the capacity to understand" why the concept of Akhand Bharat holds significance for Indians.</p>
  <p>But why is Akhand Bharat such a sensitive topic, and why do Indians attach so much importance to it? Let's explore.</p>
  <h2>Case Studies: The Persistence of Akhand Bharat in Indian Politics</h2>
  <p>Akhand Bharat has remained a persistent theme in Indian politics since independence. It is rooted in the idea that India, which had been divided by colonial powers, should be reunited into a single, unified country that reflects its historical and cultural unity.</p>
  <p>One of the most famous instances of this sentiment was during the 1962 war between India and China. The then Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, stated that the conflict was not simply about a border dispute, but about "the very soul of India". This rhetoric was effective in rallying public support for India, and the country emerged victorious in the conflict.</p>
  <p>Another case study is the government's recent decision to abrogate Article 370, which granted special status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The move was widely viewed as being in line with the Akhand Bharat ideology, with the government stating that it was necessary to integrate J&amp;K into the rest of India.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion: The Significance of Akhand Bharat</h2>
  <p>Akhand Bharat is more than just a concept. It represents the idea that India is more than just a country - it is a civilization. For Indians, this means that their identity is tied to the land, history, and culture of the subcontinent.</p>
  <p>The concept of Akhand Bharat is also significant from a geopolitical standpoint. A unified India would be a global superpower, with a population of more than 1.5 billion and an economy that is projected to be the world's third-largest by 2030.</p>
  <p>However, the idea of Akhand Bharat is also controversial, as it smacks of Hindu nationalism and revives memories of the violence that accompanied the partition of India. It is important for Indians to recognize these criticisms and work towards a better understanding of their neighbors' concerns.</p><!-- Add reference urls and hashtags sorted in trending order -->
