   <p>It was supposed to be a battle between the two best cricket teams in the world. The venue was the Ageas Bowl in Southampton, England, where India and Australia had come to compete in the final of the World Test Championship. Both teams had fought hard to reach this stage, with India beating England, New Zealand, Australia, and the West Indies, while Australia defeated Pakistan, New Zealand, India, and the West Indies.</p>
   <h2>The Test Match</h2>
   <p>The match began with Australia winning the toss and electing to bat first. They quickly established control over the game, thanks to a brilliant innings from their captain, Steve Smith, who scored 131 runs. Smith was well-supported by opener David Warner (56) and all-rounder Marcus Stoinis (56), as Australia posted an imposing total of 469.</p>
   <p>India had their task cut out for them, but with a strong batting line-up that included Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli, and Ajinkya Rahane, they were expected to give a good account of themselves. However, the Australian pacers had other ideas.</p>
   <h2>The Collapse</h2>
   <p>Pat Cummins led the charge with an outstanding spell of fast bowling, picking up four wickets for just 21 runs. He was well-supported by Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc, who chipped in with two wickets apiece. India's top order was left reeling, with Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill, and Cheteshwar Pujara back in the pavilion with just 28 runs on the board.</p>
   <p>The captain, Virat Kohli, came in at number four, but his stay at the crease was short-lived, as he was trapped lbw by Hazlewood for just 8 runs. Ajinkya Rahane and Rishabh Pant offered some resistance, but Rahane was dismissed by Starc for 49, and Pant fell to Nathan Lyon for 25.</p>
   <p>India's tail-enders tried to make a fight of it, but the damage had already been done. They were eventually bowled out for a paltry 217, giving Australia a commanding lead of 252 runs.</p>
   <h2>The Aftermath</h2>
   <p>The collapse was a stark reminder of India's problems against quality fast bowling in overseas conditions. They had struggled in South Africa, England, and New Zealand in recent years, and the same issue had now resurfaced in the WTC final. While the Australian pace attack was top-class, India's batsmen will need to find a way to counter them if they want to be successful in the future.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, Australia's pacers showed why they are considered the best in the world. Cummins, Hazlewood, and Starc bowled with pace, accuracy, and discipline, making life difficult for India's batsmen on a pitch that offered good bounce and movement. They had set the perfect platform for their team to push for victory in the Test match.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>India will need to work on their batting against pace in overseas conditions.</li>
    <li>Australia's pace attack is world-class and can trouble any team in any conditions.</li>
    <li>The collapse has set up the Test match well, with Australia in the driver's seat.</li>
   </ul>
