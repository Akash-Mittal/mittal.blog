  <h1>Afghanistan vs its Neighbours: A 6 Month Forecast</h1></br> <img src="images/Afghanistan-vs-its-Neighbours-A-6-Month-Forecast.jpeg" alt="+Afghanistan-vs-its-Neighbours-A-6-Month-Forecast+"></br><h5><span><strong>Image Credits&nbsp;</strong><a data-cke-saved-href="https://greydynamics.com/afghanistan-vs-its-neighbours-a-6-month-forecast/" target="_blank" href="https://greydynamics.com/afghanistan-vs-its-neighbours-a-6-month-forecast/" rel="noopener">https://greydynamics.com/afghanistan-vs-its-neighbours-a-6-month-forecast/</a></span></h5>
  <p>Once upon a time, there was a region in the world where three neighbouring countries, Afghanistan, Iran, and Pakistan, had to share a precious resource, water. The water came from the mountains, flowed through the rivers and streams, and irrigated the fields. The people depended on it for drinking, cooking, washing, and farming. But the water was not always enough, and the allocation of it was not always fair. Conflicts arose, tensions simmered, and violence erupted. This is not a fairy tale, but a reality of the present and a forecast for the future.</p>
  <h2>Water Wars: Afghanistan vs Iran</h2><img src="https://www.unops.org/news-and-stories/stories/drought-in-afghanistan#:~:text=According%20to%20OCHA%2C%2017.4%20million,for%20more%20than%20one%20million." alt="Drought in Afghanistan">
  <p>Afghanistan and Iran share several transboundary rivers, such as Helmand, Hirmand, and Harirud. These rivers originate in Afghanistan and flow to Iran, providing irrigation water for the Iranian farmers. However, due to drought, climate change, and mismanagement, the flow of water has decreased, causing resentment on both sides of the border.</p>
  <blockquote>
   "The Iranians are stealing our water," says Haji Abdul, a farmer from Herat, Afghanistan.
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Iranians, on the other hand, accuse the Afghans of not fulfilling their obligations under the 1973 Helmand River Treaty, which stipulates the sharing of water between the two countries. The Iranians also blame the Afghans for allowing the cultivation of opium poppies, which require large amounts of water and reduce the flow downstream.</p>
  <blockquote>
   "The Afghans are poisoning our water with their drugs," says Mohammad Ali, a farmer from Sistan and Baluchestan, Iran.
  </blockquote>
  <p>The situation is tense, and there have been occasional skirmishes between the Afghan and Iranian border guards. The Iranian parliament has even passed a bill authorizing the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps to enter Afghanistan and take measures to safeguard Iran's water rights, if necessary. The Afghan government has protested the move, calling it a violation of its sovereignty.</p>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>Case Study 1:</strong> In June 2021, Afghan security forces arrested four Iranian engineers who were working on a water management project in Herat province. The Afghans accused them of spying and network disruption. The Iranians denied the charges and demanded their release.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The forecast for the next six months is not optimistic. Both Afghanistan and Iran are facing water scarcity, rising temperatures, and political instability. The Afghan government is weak and divided, while the Iranian government is facing international sanctions and domestic protests. The two sides need to engage in dialogue and negotiations to avoid a humanitarian and ecological disaster.</p>
  <h2>Terrorism Troubles: Pakistan vs TTP</h2><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17BA/production/_121262329_afghanpakistanbordermap_v2_640-nc.png" alt="Afghan-Pakistan border map">
  <p>Pakistan and Afghanistan share a porous border, which has been a source of tension and instability for decades. The two countries have accused each other of harboring terrorists and insurgents who cross the border and carry out attacks. The Pakistani government is currently facing a serious challenge from the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that seeks to establish Sharia law in Pakistan and overthrow the government.</p>
  <blockquote>
   "The TTP is a threat to our national security and sovereignty," says Imran Khan, the Prime Minister of Pakistan.
  </blockquote>
  <p>The TTP has claimed responsibility for several deadly attacks in Pakistan, including the assassination of a prominent journalist, a bomb blast in a religious school, and the killing of security personnel. The Pakistani government has responded with military operations and arrests, but the TTP is still active and has vowed to continue its fight.</p>
  <blockquote>
   "We will not rest until we have established an Islamic caliphate in Pakistan," says Noor Wali Mehsud, the leader of TTP.
  </blockquote>
  <p>The situation is complex, as the TTP has links with the Afghan Taliban, which controls some parts of Afghanistan and has been engaged in peace negotiations with the US and the Afghan government. The Pakistani government suspects that the Afghan Taliban provides safe havens and support to the TTP, which the Afghan Taliban denies. The US, which has been trying to broker a peace deal between the Afghan Taliban and the Afghan government, is also concerned about the TTP's activities.</p>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>Case Study 2:</strong> In May 2021, the TTP attacked a Pakistani army checkpoint in North Waziristan, killing six soldiers. The Pakistani army retaliated by launching air strikes on TTP hideouts in Afghanistan's Paktia province. The Afghan government condemned the strikes as a violation of its sovereignty and warned of retaliation.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The forecast for the next six months is uncertain. The TTP is a formidable enemy, and the Pakistani army is stretched thin. The Afghan Taliban may or may not cooperate with the Pakistani government in dealing with the TTP, depending on its own interests. The US may or may not withdraw its troops from Afghanistan, depending on its own calculations. The best course of action for Pakistan is to strengthen its institutions, address the root causes of terrorism, and engage in regional cooperation.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>The conflicts between Afghanistan and its neighbours, Iran and Pakistan, are real and pressing.</li>
   <li>The causes of the conflicts are multiple and complex, involving water, terrorism, and geopolitics.</li>
   <li>The solutions to the conflicts require diplomacy, dialogue, and cooperation at the regional and international levels.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>In the end, the people of Afghanistan, Iran, and Pakistan share a common history, culture, and destiny. They can choose to fight over their differences or to work together for their common good. The choice is theirs and ours.</p>
