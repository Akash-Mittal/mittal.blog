   <p>India and its neighbors have been maintaining a cooperative and friendly relationship to promote regional development and stability in recent years. As part of this initiative, India recently announced its decision to host the virtual Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in 2020. This is an unprecedented move that sends the right signals to the region that cooperation and collaboration are essential for long-term security and prosperity.</p>
   <h2>Examples with Case Studies</h2>
   <p>The SCO is a regional organization comprising eight members, including China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, India and Pakistan. The organization was formed in 2001 with the aim of promoting cooperation in political, economic, and security matters among member states. India, as an observer since 2005, became a full member in 2017.</p>
   <p>India's decision to host the virtual SCO summit amid the Covid-19 crisis, when physical meetings have become difficult, is a testimony to the country's commitment to regional cooperation. The virtual format will enable leaders to discuss critical issues related to regional security, economic cooperation, and people-to-people ties while maintaining social distancing. It is also an important step towards making the SCO more efficient, effective, and responsive to the needs of member states.</p>
   <p>A case in point is India's proposal to create a working group on traditional medicine within the SCO framework, which was welcomed by all member states. This initiative reflects India's traditional knowledge in the field of medicine and its commitment to promoting cross-border cooperation to harness the benefits of traditional medicine for the well-being of people in the region.</p>
   <p>Another example is India's participation in the SCO's joint military exercise, which aims to enhance military-to-military cooperation and interoperability among member states. India's active participation in the exercise reflects its commitment to regional peace and security and its willingness to work with other countries in the region to address security challenges.</p>
