    <h2>Abandoned and Hopeless: The Plight of Afghan Students</h2>
    <p>For many Afghan students, going to India to pursue higher education was a dream come true. With renowned universities and a vibrant student community, India was the perfect destination to fulfill their aspirations. However, since the Taliban took over Afghanistan in August 2021, this dream has turned into a nightmare.</p>
    <p>The Indian government has stopped issuing visas to Afghan students, citing security concerns. This has left hundreds of students stranded, unable to resume their studies and unsure about their future.</p>
    <p>Take the case of 23-year-old Ahmad, who was pursuing a Masters degree in Political Science from a university in New Delhi. He had gone back to Afghanistan in July to attend his sister's wedding, little knowing that he would be stuck there indefinitely. He is now living in a state of uncertainty, worried about his safety and his future.</p>
    <p>"I feel abandoned by the Indian government. They promised to help us, but now they have turned their backs on us," Ahmad says, his voice trembling with emotion.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, Ahmad's case is not unique. There are hundreds of Afghan students who are in a similar situation, unable to return to India and resume their studies.</p>

    <h2>The Impact of Visa Restrictions on Afghan Students</h2>
    <p>The Indian government's decision to stop issuing visas to Afghan students has had a profound impact on their lives and their future. Many students who had secured admissions to prestigious universities in India are now unable to attend classes, take exams or complete their degrees.</p>
    <p>For instance, 21-year-old Mariam had secured admission to the University of Delhi's prestigious St. Stephen's College to study English literature. However, she is now back in Kabul, unable to continue her studies. "I had worked hard to get into St. Stephen's, it was a dream come true. But now it's all gone to waste," she says, her voice breaking.</p>
    <p>Many Afghan students had taken loans to fund their education in India, but they are now unable to repay their debts as they are unemployed and unable to earn a livelihood.</p>
    <p>The visa restrictions have also taken a toll on the mental health of Afghan students. Many are suffering from anxiety, depression and trauma, as they grapple with the uncertainty and insecurity of their situation.</p>

    <h2>The Need for Support and Solidarity</h2>
    <p>The plight of Afghan students is a cause for concern, not just for the individuals involved, but for the international community as a whole. It is imperative that countries like India, which have historically been allies of Afghanistan, step up and support its people in this time of crisis.</p>
    <p>The Indian government should reconsider its visa restrictions and find a way to allow Afghan students to return to India and resume their studies. It should also provide financial and emotional support to those who are stranded in Afghanistan.</p>
    <p>International organizations, universities and civil society groups should also come forward to support Afghan students. They should provide scholarships, job opportunities and mental health support to those who are in distress.</p>
    <p>At this critical juncture, it is important for the international community to show solidarity with the people of Afghanistan and support them in whatever way possible.</p>
