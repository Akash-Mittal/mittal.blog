  <p>India and China have been at loggerheads over the Line of Actual Control (LAC) for many years. However, the recent border tensions and skirmishes have escalated the situation to a new high. In this article, we will discuss how India has stood up to China's LAC adventurism and delegitimized Pakistan terror.</p>
  <h2>Examples of India's Response to China's Adventurism</h2>
  <p>India's response to China's LAC adventurism has been firm and resolute. The Indian government has taken several measures to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Here are some examples:</p>
  <h3>Case Study 1: Doklam Standoff</h3>
  <p>In 2017, China attempted to construct a road through the Doklam plateau, which is part of Bhutan but claimed by both China and India. Indian troops intervened and stopped the construction, triggering a standoff that lasted for more than two months. In the end, China backed down and withdrew its forces, and the status quo was maintained.</p>
  <h3>Case Study 2: Galwan Valley Clash</h3>
  <p>In June 2020, Chinese and Indian troops clashed in the Galwan Valley, resulting in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers and an unknown number of Chinese troops. India responded by banning Chinese apps and canceling contracts with Chinese companies in infrastructure projects.</p>
  <h3>Case Study 3: India-US Alliance</h3>
  <p>India has also strengthened its alliance with the United States to counter China's aggression. India and the US have signed several agreements to boost defense cooperation and enhance strategic ties. This partnership has sent a strong message to China that India is not alone in its fight against LAC adventurism.</p>
  <h2>Delegitimizing Pakistan Terror</h2>
  <p>India has also been successful in delegitimizing Pakistan's state-sponsored terrorism. India has provided extensive evidence to the international community to prove that Pakistan supports terrorist groups like Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba. Here are some examples:</p>
  <h3>Case Study 1: Pulwama Attack</h3>
  <p>In February 2019, a suicide attack by Jaish-e-Mohammed killed 40 Indian soldiers in Pulwama, Jammu &amp; Kashmir. India provided evidence to the international community to prove that the attack was planned and executed by Pakistan-based terrorists. The international community condemned Pakistan's support for terrorism and called for action against the perpetrators.</p>
  <h3>Case Study 2: FATF Blacklisting</h3>
  <p>India's efforts to delegitimize Pakistan's support for terrorism have also resulted in the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) blacklisting Pakistan for failing to take effective action against money laundering and terrorist financing. This has had a significant impact on Pakistan's economy and reputation.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>India's response to China's LAC adventurism and its efforts to delegitimize Pakistan's support for terrorism have been effective in sending a strong message to China and the international community. India remains committed to defending its territorial integrity and fighting terrorism, and it will continue to take all necessary measures to achieve these objectives.</p>
