  <p>It was a dark and stormy night in a small village near the India-Pakistan border. People were huddled inside their homes, fearing for their safety as they heard the sound of bullets and mortar shells being fired from across the border. Suddenly, they heard a loud roar in the sky, and looked up to see a missile streaking towards its target in Pakistan. The missile hit its target with deadly accuracy, destroying an enemy military installation that had been threatening India's security for months.</p>
  <p>This was made possible by India's new generation ballistic missile called 'Agni Prime', which was developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and successfully tested on June 7, 2023. This missile is capable of countering Pakistan's missile program and providing India with a strong deterrence capability.</p>
  <h2>Examples with Case Studies</h2>
  <p>Agni Prime is a game-changer in the India-Pakistan strategic balance. It is a surface-to-surface missile that can be launched from land, sea, or air, and has a range of over 5,000 km. This means that it can target any part of Pakistan with deadly precision, including its major cities like Islamabad, Lahore, and Karachi.</p>
  <p>One of the unique features of Agni Prime is its ability to be launched at night, which makes it difficult for Pakistan to detect and intercept. This was demonstrated in the first pre-induction night launch conducted by the users on June 7, 2023. The missile successfully hit its target with high accuracy, validating the technological capabilities and operational readiness of the weapon system.</p>
  <p>Another key advantage of Agni Prime is its mobility. This allows it to be deployed at multiple locations across India, making it difficult for Pakistan to launch a preemptive strike or locate and destroy the missile sites. This mobility was demonstrated during the three previously successful developmental trials of the missile, which were conducted in different locations across India.</p>
  <p>One case study that highlights the significance of Agni Prime is the 2019 Balakot airstrike. This was carried out by the Indian Air Force in response to a terrorist attack on its troops in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir. The airstrike targeted a terrorist training camp in Balakot, Pakistan, and was carried out using precision-guided munitions like the Spice 2000 bomb. However, if Agni Prime had been available at that time, it could have provided a more reliable and powerful option for retaliating against the terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan.</p>
