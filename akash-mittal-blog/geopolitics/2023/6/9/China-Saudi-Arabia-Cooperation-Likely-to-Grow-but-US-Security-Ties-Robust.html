  <p>When a young Saudi engineer was tasked with finding a supplier for the construction of a new train network, he turned to China. It was 2015, and Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 — an ambitious plan to diversify its economy away from oil — had just been launched. The engineer, who asked to remain anonymous, saw China as the perfect partner and quickly arranged a visit to the country with a Saudi delegation.</p>
  <p>The trip was a success, and the Saudi government soon signed a $1.5 billion agreement with a Chinese firm to build the train system. It was a clear example of the growing cooperation between China and Saudi Arabia. Over the past decade, the two countries have strengthened their diplomatic, economic, and military ties, with China investing heavily in Saudi Arabia's infrastructure development.</p>
  <h2>Growing Cooperation between China and Saudi Arabia</h2>
  <p>China is now Saudi Arabia's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade exceeding $63 billion in 2020. The two countries have also worked together on multiple infrastructure projects, including the construction of a $10 billion refining and petrochemicals complex in China's northeastern Liaoning province.</p>
  <p>But the cooperation between China and Saudi Arabia is not limited to economic ties. They have also strengthened their collaborations in the military and security spheres. In 2017, China and Saudi Arabia held their first joint naval exercise, followed by a joint air force exercise in 2019.</p>
  <p>However, the growing cooperation between the two countries has raised concerns among some analysts, who worry that it might threaten the strategic relationship between Saudi Arabia and the United States.</p>
  <h2>Robust US-Saudi Security Ties</h2>
  <p>The US and Saudi Arabia share a long and complicated history, with the US supporting the Saudi monarchy since the 1940s to keep oil flowing and maintain a strategic foothold in the Middle East. The two countries regularly conduct joint military exercises and share intelligence information.</p>
  <p>But the relationship between the two countries has been tested in recent years, with the US criticizing Saudi Arabia's human rights records and the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. However, the US has remained one of Saudi Arabia's most crucial allies in the region.</p>
  <h2>The Future of Saudi Arabia's Foreign Relations</h2>
  <p>As Saudi Arabia seeks to diversify its economy and reduce its dependence on oil, it will need to forge stronger partnerships with foreign countries. While the relationship between China and Saudi Arabia is likely to grow, the country's ties with the US remain essential to its long-term security and stability.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, Saudi Arabia is in a delicate balancing act between strengthening its ties with China and maintaining its robust security relationship with the US. As the country navigates these complex foreign relations, it will need to remain vigilant to ensure that it does not risk compromising its national security or economic interests.</p>
