  <p>It was in 2001 that Jim O'Neill, then head of global economic research at Goldman Sachs, coined the acronym "BRIC" to describe four of the world's emerging economies - Brazil, Russia, India, and China. In 2010, South Africa joined the group, and it became known as BRICS.</p>
  <p>The group was formed with the aim of promoting economic cooperation and playing an increasing role in international relations. BRICS was seen as a potential counterbalance to Western hegemony and a forum for member countries to have a say in global issues. However, more than a decade later, many experts believe that BRICS has failed to live up to its potential. In this article, we look at some of the reasons why.</p>
  <h2>1. Lack of Unity</h2>
  <p>One of the reasons why BRICS has not achieved its true potential is the lack of unity among its members. Each member country has its own priorities and concerns and, as a result, there is often a lack of consensus on key issues. For example, in 2016, India pulled out of the BRICS summit on tax evasion, stating that its concerns were not being addressed adequately.</p>
  <p>Another example of lack of unity is the issue of trade. While China has been pushing for deeper economic integration among BRICS countries, India has been more cautious. India has concerns about the widening trade deficit with China and has been resistant to further opening up its markets to Chinese goods.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the differences among BRICS members. China's initial mishandling of the outbreak led to tension with India and Brazil, both of which have blamed China for their own outbreaks.</p>
  <p>Without a shared vision and common agenda, BRICS is constrained in its ability to influence global affairs.</p>
  <h2>2. Economic Challenges</h2>
  <p>Another factor that has hindered BRICS' success is economic challenges faced by some of its members. While China has emerged as a global economic powerhouse, Russia and Brazil have been struggling with recession and political instability. India's economy has been growing, but it faces numerous challenges such as high levels of inequality and corruption.</p>
  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated these economic challenges. Countries around the world have seen a sharp decline in economic activity, and BRICS members have not been immune. In fact, the International Monetary Fund has projected negative growth rates for all BRICS countries in 2020.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, the economic challenges faced by some members have strained the group's cohesion. Russia, for example, has faced economic sanctions by the West, while Brazil has had to deal with corruption scandals and political turmoil.</p>
  <h2>3. Failure to Deliver on Promises</h2>
  <p>Finally, BRICS has been criticized for its failure to deliver on its promises. Despite its potential to be a counterbalance to Western hegemony, the group has not been able to make significant strides in the political arena. It has been unable to provide a unified voice on key issues such as climate change, human rights, and global governance.</p>
  <p>The group has also been criticized for its slow progress on economic integration. While some progress has been made, such as the creation of the BRICS New Development Bank, the group has not been able to deepen economic ties significantly.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the limitations of BRICS' response to global crises. While the group did hold virtual summits and issue joint statements, it was unable to provide significant assistance to member countries that were particularly hard hit by the pandemic.</p>
  <blockquote>
   "The BRICS countries have never really been united beyond their opposition to the dominance of the US and Europe in global economic governance. They have faced many common challenges, but none have been important enough to create the sense of shared destiny required to build a true partnership."
  </blockquote>
  <p>In conclusion, the formation of BRICS was a significant event in the global arena, signaling the rise of emerging economies as a force in international relations. However, more than a decade later, the group has not been able to live up to its potential. The lack of unity among its members, economic challenges faced by some members, and failure to deliver on promises have all contributed to BRICS' underperformance. It remains to be seen whether the group will be able to overcome these challenges and emerge as a true force in global affairs.</p>
