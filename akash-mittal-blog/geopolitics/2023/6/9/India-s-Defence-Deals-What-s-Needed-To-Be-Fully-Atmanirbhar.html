  <p>Imagine a country under constant threat of cyber attacks, terrorism, and war. A country that needs to be ready to defend itself at all times. This is India.</p>
  <p>India has one of the largest armies in the world and spends billions of dollars every year to keep its military technologically advanced and updated. However, despite its efforts, the country still has a long way to go to be "fully Atmanirbhar" or self-sufficient in defence.</p>
  <p>In this article, we will discuss India's defence deals and what the country needs to do to be fully Atmanirbhar.</p>
  <h2>The Agni Prime Ballistic Missile</h2>
  <p>In February 2021, India successfully test-fired its Agni Prime ballistic missile, which is capable of carrying nuclear warheads. This test was a significant achievement for India, as it demonstrated the country's ability to defend itself against potential threats from its neighbours.</p>
  <p>With the development of the Agni Prime missile, India has strengthened its defence capabilities. However, this is only one step towards achieving Atmanirbhar.</p>
  <h2>Project 75-I</h2>
  <p>Project 75-I is a program to build six new submarines for the Indian Navy. The project has been in the pipeline for more than a decade. In 2019, the government approved the acquisition of six new submarines under Project 75-I.</p>
  <p>However, the project is now stuck due to delays in the acquisition process. The Indian Navy wanted the submarines to be built by a foreign shipyard in collaboration with an Indian shipyard. However, no agreement has been reached yet.</p>
  <p>Being Atmanirbhar means being self-sufficient in defence, and for that, India needs to build its submarines. The government needs to fast-track the acquisition process and ensure that the submarines are built in India.</p>
  <h2>India-US Fighter Jet Engines Deal</h2>
  <p>In 2020, India signed a deal with the United States to purchase 21 MH-60R Seahawk helicopters for the Indian Navy. As part of the deal, India will also buy 24 multi-role MH-60 Romeo helicopters for the Indian Air Force.</p>
  <p>The helicopters will be equipped with GE Aviation engines, which are critical components in modern fighter jets. The deal is a significant step towards strengthening India's defence capabilities.</p>
  <p>However, to be fully Atmanirbhar, India needs to build its fighter jets instead of relying on foreign suppliers. Building fighter jets in India will not only help the country save money but also create job opportunities for the local population.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, India has made significant progress in strengthening its defence capabilities, but there is still a long way to go to be fully Atmanirbhar. The country needs to build its submarines, fighter jets and create a robust defence manufacturing ecosystem.</p>
  <p>Being Atmanirbhar in defence is not only critical for India's security but also for its economic growth.</p>
