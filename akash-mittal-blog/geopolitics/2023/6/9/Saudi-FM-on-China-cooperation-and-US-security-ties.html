  <p>In a recent interview with Al-Monitor, Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud talked about the growing cooperation between Saudi Arabia and China, but also stressed the country's robust security ties with the United States.</p>
  <h2>The growing cooperation between Saudi Arabia and China</h2>
  <p>Saudi Arabia and China have been increasing their economic and strategic ties in recent years, with China becoming Saudi Arabia's largest trading partner and a major investor in its oil and gas industry. In 2017, China's President Xi Jinping visited Saudi Arabia and signed a series of agreements, including a $20 billion investment in the country's infrastructure sector and a strategic partnership on energy cooperation.</p>
  <p>More recently, Saudi Arabia has been seeking to diversify its economy and reduce its reliance on oil exports. As part of this effort, the kingdom has been working to attract Chinese investment in industries such as renewable energy, technology, and tourism. In 2019, the two countries signed 35 agreements worth a total of $28 billion during a visit by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to China.</p>
  <p>However, some experts have raised concerns about the potential risks of deepening ties between Saudi Arabia and China, particularly in terms of human rights and security. China has faced criticism for its treatment of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang and its suppression of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, while Saudi Arabia has faced criticism for its human rights record and its involvement in conflicts in the region.</p>
  <h2>The importance of US security ties for Saudi Arabia</h2>
  <p>While Saudi Arabia and China are likely to continue their economic and strategic cooperation, Saudi Arabia's security ties with the United States remain a key priority for the kingdom. The two countries have a long-standing partnership dating back to the 1940s, when the US began providing military support to Saudi Arabia as part of its Cold War strategy.</p>
  <p>Today, the US and Saudi Arabia cooperate on a range of security issues, including counterterrorism, intelligence sharing, and military training. The US has also provided Saudi Arabia with billions of dollars in advanced military hardware, such as fighter jets and missile defense systems.</p>
  <p>However, the US-Saudi relationship has faced significant challenges in recent years, particularly in the aftermath of the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 and the kingdom's involvement in the war in Yemen. Some US lawmakers have called for a reevaluation of the US-Saudi relationship and for a stronger stance on human rights and accountability.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The growing cooperation between Saudi Arabia and China is likely to continue, as both countries seek to strengthen their economic and strategic ties. However, this trend raises concerns about potential human rights violations and security risks, which should be closely monitored by policymakers and expert analysts.</p>
  <p>At the same time, the importance of the US-Saudi security relationship cannot be overstated, as the two countries continue to face a range of shared threats and challenges in the region. While there are concerns about the nature of this relationship and the need for greater accountability and transparency, it remains a key pillar of Saudi Arabia's foreign policy and regional posture.</p>
