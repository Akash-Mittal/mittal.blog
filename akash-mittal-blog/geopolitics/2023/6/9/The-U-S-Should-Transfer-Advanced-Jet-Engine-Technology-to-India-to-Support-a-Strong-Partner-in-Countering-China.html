   <h2>An Interesting Story:</h2>
   <p>Once upon a time, there was a small country named X which was struggling to build its fleet of fighter jets. They had the expertise to manufacture and assemble the planes, but lacked the technology to build the engines that would propel them. In the meantime, their rival country, Y, was progressing in leaps and bounds in the field of advanced jet engine technology. Country X knew that they needed to catch up fast, in order to maintain a balance of power in the region.</p>
   <h2>Case Studies:</h2>
   <p>This story may sound like a work of fiction, but it perfectly echoes the situation between two real-life countries: India and China. India is rapidly emerging as a superpower and is viewed as a key strategic partner by the United States. China, on the other hand, is seen as a potential threat to global peace and stability due to its aggressive expansionism in the South China Sea and disputes with its neighboring countries.</p>
   <p>India has been working on developing its indigenous fighter jet program, the Tejas, for the past three decades. Although the program has come a long way, one of its major setbacks is the engine. The current engine on the Tejas is not powerful or reliable enough to meet global standards. This is where the U.S. comes in. The American company, General Electric, has developed one of the most advanced fighter engines in the world, the F414. By transferring this technology to India, the U.S. would be giving India a major advantage in countering China's growing military strength in the region.</p>
   <p>Another example is the decision by the Australian government to partner with India to develop a new fleet of fighter jets, the Next Generation Air Combat Capability. Australia and India have agreed to pool resources and expertise to develop a new fighter jet with advanced capabilities. This is aimed at countering China's increasing military might in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

    <li>Developing indigenous fighter jets is critical for maintaining defense capabilities and sovereignty.</li>
    <li>Advanced jet engine technology plays a crucial role in improving fighter jet performance and capabilities.</li>
    <li>Transferring this technology to strategic partners like India will not only bolster their defense capabilities but will also help counter any potential threats from China.</li>
