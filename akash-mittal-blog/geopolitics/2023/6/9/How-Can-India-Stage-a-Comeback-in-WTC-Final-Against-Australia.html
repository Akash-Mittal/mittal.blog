   <p>As the World Test Championship Final between India and Australia approaches, cricket fans around the world are eagerly waiting for one of the most anticipated matches of the year. But with India losing their last Test series against England and Australia having an impressive record in recent matches, the odds seem to be stacked against India. However, ex-Pakistan captain has revealed a strategic blueprint for India to make a sensational comeback in the WTC final against Australia.</p>

    <h2>Strategic Blueprint for India</h2>
    <p>According to the ex-Pakistan captain, the key to India's success in the WTC finals will be a combination of several factors. One of the primary factors that he highlighted was India's bowling attack. The Indian bowling attack has been one of the most potent in the world in recent times. With Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, Ishant Sharma, and Ravichandran Ashwin leading the attack, India has a formidable line-up that can trouble the best of batsmen. The ex-Pakistan captain suggested that India's bowlers should focus on exploiting Australia's weakness against the short ball. Australia has struggled against the short ball in the past, and India could use this weakness to their advantage.</p>
    <p>Another critical factor that the ex-Pakistan captain highlighted was India's batting. India has a star-studded batting line-up that boasts the likes of Virat Kohli, Cheteshwar Pujara, Rohit Sharma, and Rishabh Pant. However, India's batting has come under scrutiny in recent times, and the ex-Pakistan captain believes that India's batsmen should focus on playing with patience and discipline. With the pitch in Southampton expected to assist swing and seam bowling, it will be crucial for India's batsmen to play with discipline and not be tempted to play rash shots.</p>

    <h2>Case Studies: India's Previous Wins Against Australia</h2>
    <p>India may be the underdogs in the WTC final against Australia, but they have had some memorable wins against Australia in the past. One such instance was the 2001 test series between India and Australia. In the first test of the series, Australia scored a mammoth 445 runs in the first innings. India, however, managed to score 171 and 657/7 in their two innings, with VVS Laxman and Rahul Dravid playing memorable innings. Australia, who were chasing a target of 384, were bowled out for 212, and India registered an emphatic win.</p>
    <p>Another memorable win for India against Australia was the 2017 Border-Gavaskar trophy. India won the series 2-1, with Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin being the architects of India's success. In the series, India managed to bowl out Australia for a paltry 137 runs in the first innings of the Bangalore Test, with Jadeja picking up six wickets. India eventually won the match by 75 runs, with Jadeja being named the Player of the Match.</p>

India's bowling attack and batting have the potential to trouble Australia, and with discipline and patience, India could emerge as the victors of the World Test Championship Final.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, India must focus on exploiting Australia's weakness against the short ball, and their batsmen must play with discipline and patience. If they can do so, India could very well be on their way to winning their first World Test Championship title.</p>
