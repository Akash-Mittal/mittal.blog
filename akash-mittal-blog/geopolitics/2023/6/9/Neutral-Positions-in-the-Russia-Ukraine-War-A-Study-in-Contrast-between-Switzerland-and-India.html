  <p>It was a cold winter day in Kiev, Ukraine in February 2022 when Russian troops stormed the country, alarming the world. The United States, Canada, and other European Union countries were quick to condemn Russia, while others chose to remain neutral. In this article, we'll explore the neutral positions taken by Switzerland and India in the Russia-Ukraine war, and what it means for their foreign policies.</p>
  <h2>Switzerland: A Neutral Haven Since World War II</h2>
  <p>Switzerland has been famously neutral since World War II, having not participated in any major international conflict since then. This neutrality has been a cornerstone of their foreign policy, allowing them to maintain strong diplomatic relations with other countries, regardless of their political affiliations.</p>
  <p>During the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Switzerland maintained its neutral stance, choosing not to take sides. The Swiss government condemned the invasion, stating that it went against the principles of international law and was a violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.</p>
  <p>In addition to condemning the invasion, Switzerland also offered to play a mediator role in the conflict, offering to host talks between Russia, Ukraine, and other countries involved in the conflict. This move shows their commitment to peaceful conflict resolution.</p>
  <h3>Case Study: Swiss Business Interests in Russia</h3>
  <p>Switzerland's neutral position in the Russia-Ukraine conflict can also be explained by their significant business interests in Russia. Swiss companies have invested heavily in Russia, particularly in the energy sector, which provides the country with a large portion of its oil and gas imports.</p>
  <p>Swiss multinational companies like Gazprom and Lukoil have a major presence in Russia, making Switzerland hesitate to take a strong stance against the country. By remaining neutral, Switzerland can maintain its business ties with Russia, while also upholding its commitment to international law.</p>
  <h2>India: A Balancing Act in International Relations</h2>
  <p>India has a long history of balancing its relationships with major global powers. India developed its foreign policy of non-alignment during the Cold War, a strategy that allowed it to maintain relationships with both the United States and the Soviet Union without taking sides.</p>
  <p>This balancing act has continued in recent years, with India developing closer relationships with the United States and other Western democracies, while also maintaining its relationships with China and Russia.</p>
  <p>During the Russia-Ukraine conflict, India chose to maintain its neutral position, echoing Switzerland's condemnation of the invasion while also offering to play a mediator role in the conflict.</p>
  <h3>Case Study: India's Energy Needs</h3>
  <p>India's energy needs have also played a role in their neutral stance on the Russia-Ukraine conflict. India is heavily reliant on oil imports, with Russia being one of its major suppliers.</p>
  <p>By remaining neutral, India can maintain its energy supply from Russia, while also upholding its commitment to international law. This move also allows India to avoid angering the United States and other Western democracies, which have been strong in their condemnation of Russia's actions.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The neutral positions taken by Switzerland and India in the Russia-Ukraine conflict illustrate their commitment to peaceful conflict resolution and their ability to balance their foreign relationships. Switzerland, with its longstanding history of neutrality, maintained its role as a mediator while protecting its economic interests. India, with its balancing act of relationships, echoed Switzerland's condemnation of the invasion while looking out for its energy needs.</p>
  <p>As the world watches the outcome of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the roles of both Switzerland and India in this crisis demonstrate the importance of neutrality in international affairs.</p><em>References:</em>
