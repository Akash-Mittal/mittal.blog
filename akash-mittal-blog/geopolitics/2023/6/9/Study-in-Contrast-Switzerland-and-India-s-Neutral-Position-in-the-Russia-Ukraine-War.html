   <p>February 2022 saw Russia invade Ukraine, which resulted in many countries, particularly Western democracies such as the US, Canada, and countries of the EU, vehemently responding to Russia's actions. Whereas Russia would argue it acted in self-defense and was merely protecting ethnic Russians in Ukraine, many of the countries found the invasion to be a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>
   <p>However, Switzerland and India were two countries that maintained neutrality when it came to the Russia-Ukraine war. Their position was in stark contrast to that of the other Western democracies. In this article, we will explore why these two countries chose to remain neutral and analyze how effective their neutral stance was in light of the ongoing conflict.</p>
   <h2>Switzerland's Neutral Position</h2>
   <p>Switzerland has a longstanding policy of neutrality and non-interference when it comes to international conflicts. The country did not get involved in either of the two world wars and has maintained neutrality in subsequent conflicts as well. Switzerland viewed the Russia-Ukraine conflict as a regional issue, and therefore, it chose to remain neutral and focus on its own interests.</p>
   <p>Switzerland's neutral stance was crucial in facilitating dialogue between Russia and Ukraine. Switzerland has historically acted as a mediator in conflicts, and it used its good offices to bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table. The city of Geneva hosted peace talks between the two countries, and Switzerland acted as a mediator in these talks. Furthermore, Switzerland provided humanitarian aid to civilians affected by the conflict, which was an important move as many of the other countries involved in the conflict were focused on military aid.</p>
   <p>While Switzerland's approach may have been effective in the short-term, some critics argue that its neutrality was a missed opportunity to take a moral stance against Russia's aggression towards Ukraine. In the long-term, Switzerland's neutrality in this conflict may hurt its international reputation, particularly if Russia's actions towards Ukraine are later deemed unacceptable by the international community.</p>
   <h2>India's Neutral Position</h2>
   <p>India was another country that chose to remain neutral in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. India has traditionally maintained a policy of non-alignment and has refused to take sides in international conflicts. Moreover, India has a close relationship with Russia, which it views as an important strategic partner.</p>
   <p>India's neutral stance enabled it to maintain its relationship with Russia while avoiding any confrontation with the US or other Western democracies. Furthermore, India played a significant role in providing humanitarian aid to those affected by the conflict, particularly in the form of medicine and medical supplies. India's approach was crucial in ensuring that civilians caught up in the conflict received much-needed aid.</p>
   <p>However, some critics argue that India's neutral stance could be interpreted as tacit support for Russia's actions, particularly because Russia was violating Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. India's stance also hurt its international reputation, and some analysts argue that it was not in line with India's traditional position on global issues such as human rights and democracy.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The study in contrast between Switzerland and India's neutral position in the Russia-Ukraine war shows the different approaches countries can take when it comes to international conflicts. While Switzerland's neutral stance enabled it to play a mediating role in the conflict and provide humanitarian aid, some critics argue it could have missed an opportunity to take a moral position on Russia's aggression towards Ukraine. On the other hand, India's neutral stance allowed it to maintain its strategic partnership with Russia while providing needed aid to those affected by the conflict. However, it may have hurt India's international standing and was not in line with its traditional position on global issues.</p>
