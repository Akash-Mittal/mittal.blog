  <p>Riyadh, Saudi Arabia - Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco) has expressed optimism about the oil market's outlook for the second half of the year, citing strong demand from China and India.</p>
  <p>According to Saudi Aramco's CEO, Amin Nasser, the company foresees a "sound" outlook for oil in the second half as economic recovery continues in China and India, two of the world's largest oil consumers. Nasser highlighted the increase in industrial activity and improving mobility due to easing COVID-19 restrictions as contributing factors to the rising demand.</p>
  <p>China, the world's biggest importer of crude oil, has experienced a robust economic rebound following the containment of the pandemic. The country's strong industrial growth and renewed demand for transportation fuels have supported the recovery in oil consumption.</p>
  <p>Similarly, India, another major oil importer, is witnessing a steady improvement in economic activities after a severe downturn caused by the pandemic. As lockdown measures have been gradually lifted, transportation and industrial sectors are gaining momentum, leading to increased oil demand.</p>
  <p>Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil exporter, has adjusted its production levels to meet the rising demand. The company increased its output to 9.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in May, up from an average of 8.5 million bpd in the first quarter of the year.</p>
  <p>The positive outlook for oil demand from China and India also aligns with OPEC's recent decision to gradually ease production cuts. The organization anticipates a strong rebound in global oil demand throughout the second half of 2021.</p>
  <p>However, concerns remain regarding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and potential disruptions caused by new variants. The resurgence of cases in certain regions, as well as the rollout of vaccination programs, could impact the pace of economic recovery and, consequently, oil consumption.</p>
  <p>Saudi Aramco, nonetheless, remains optimistic, expecting that the positive trend in oil demand will outweigh any short-term challenges. The company continues to closely monitor the market dynamics and consumer behavior to adapt its strategies accordingly.</p>
