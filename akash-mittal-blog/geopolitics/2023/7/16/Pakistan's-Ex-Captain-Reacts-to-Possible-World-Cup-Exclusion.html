  <p>In a recent interview, former Pakistan cricket team captain expresses his concerns about the potential exclusion of Pakistan from the upcoming World Cup. The legendary cricketer highlights that such a decision would be a great injustice to the millions of cricket fans in the country.</p>
  <p>The buzz around Pakistan's participation in the World Cup has been growing, and fans have eagerly been awaiting the official announcement. However, there have been speculations regarding Pakistan's potential exclusion due to various reasons.</p>
  <p>The former captain takes a strong stance on the issue, arguing that Pakistan has always been a competitive team and has a rich cricketing history. He emphasizes that the team's performance in the past should not be overlooked and that excluding them would undermine the spirit of fair play in the tournament.</p>
  <p>Moreover, the ex-captain points out that cricket is not just a sport in Pakistan; it is a passion that unites the nation. The fans invest their emotions and energy into supporting their favorite players and the team. Excluding Pakistan from the World Cup would not only disappoint the fans but also deprive them of an opportunity to witness thrilling matches and showcase their support.</p>
  <p>The former captain further argues that Pakistan is a deserving team and has proven its mettle in various cricketing events over the years. He believes that every team should have an equal chance to participate and demonstrate their skills at the highest level. Excluding Pakistan would send the wrong message to aspiring young cricketers and discourage them from pursuing their dreams.</p>
  <p>As the official World Cup announcement draws near, cricket fans across Pakistan anxiously await the decision. Social media platforms have witnessed a surge in posts and discussions, with hashtags related to Pakistan's exclusion trending at the top.</p>
