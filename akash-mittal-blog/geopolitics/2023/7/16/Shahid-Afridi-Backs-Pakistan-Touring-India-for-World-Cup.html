  <p>Following the victorious Bangalore Test, former Pakistani cricketer Shahid Afridi has voiced his support for Pakistan's cricket team touring India for the upcoming World Cup. Afridi's endorsement comes amidst concerns regarding security and fan behavior.</p>
  <p>The Bangalore Test match in 2015 witnessed an unfortunate incident where stones were pelted at the Pakistan team bus. This event left a lasting impact on the players and the cricketing fraternity. However, Afridi believes it is crucial for both nations to separate politics from sports.</p>
  <p>Afridi stated, "I understand the concerns and apprehensions related to the security of our players. No player should ever feel unsafe while representing their country. However, it is vital to leave behind past incidents and focus on the spirit of the game."</p>
  <p>The former cricketer stressed the importance of cricket in bridging the gap between India and Pakistan. He mentioned that sports have a unique ability to foster peace and goodwill among nations. Afridi further added, "By participating in the World Cup in India, we can send a strong message of unity and friendship."</p>
  <p>Despite tensions between the two countries, cricket has often served as a medium to improve relations. The India-Pakistan cricket rivalry is one of the most intense and highly anticipated battles in the sport. Afridi believes that competing on the field can help reduce the existing animosity and pave the way for better understanding between the nations.</p>
  <p>Social media platforms have been buzzing with discussions regarding the potential hashtag trends related to the World Cup and the tour. Here are the most trending hashtags associated with this news:</p>

  <p>As the World Cup approaches, fans and authorities are hopeful that cricket can once again play a role in fostering peace and bringing people together. While concerns regarding security remain valid, Shahid Afridi's endorsement for the Pakistani team touring India adds weight to the argument that sports can transcend political differences, and in turn, strengthen bilateral relations.</p>
