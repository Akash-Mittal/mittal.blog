  <p>China's exports took a severe hit in June, further aggravating the country's ongoing economic troubles. The impact of the global pandemic, strained relations with major trading partners, and disruptions in global supply chains were among the primary reasons for this significant slump.</p>
  <p>The General Administration of Customs reported a staggering 26.2% drop in exports during June, compared to the same period last year. This marks the worst decline in Chinese exports since the 2009 global financial crisis. With countries imposing lockdowns and travel restrictions globally, demand for Chinese goods plummeted, intensifying the challenges faced by the world's second-largest economy.</p>
  <p>The ongoing trade war with the United States has also played a major role in this downturn. The two economic powerhouses have engaged in tit-for-tat tariffs over the past two years, impacting bilateral trade significantly. As the relationship between the two nations continues to deteriorate, the trade losses are expected to deepen further.</p>
  <h2>Supply chain disruptions increase woes</h2>
  <p>In addition to the pandemic and trade tensions, disruptions in global supply chains have been a significant contributing factor. The outbreak of COVID-19 led to factory closures, logistics constraints, and reduced manufacturing output, causing severe disruptions in the flow of goods and materials. This has further impacted China's export-oriented economy.</p>
  <p>Several industries, including electronics, automobiles, and textiles, heavily reliant on Chinese exports, have experienced a significant blow. With factories operating at reduced capacities and demand shrinking, many businesses are grappling with tremendous challenges. The adverse effects of the pandemic-induced disruptions are expected to exert pressure on China's economic recovery in the coming months.</p>
  <p>The Chinese government has implemented various measures to mitigate the impact of the economic slump. These efforts include increasing government spending, adopting policies to boost domestic consumption, and providing support to affected businesses. However, with the current global landscape remaining uncertain, the road to recovery appears to be treacherous.</p>
