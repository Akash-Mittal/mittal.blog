  <p>Former Pakistani cricketer Shahid Afridi has made a big statement about the current state of cricket. In an interview with a leading sports channel, Afridi expressed his concerns regarding the decline in cricket's popularity and the lack of innovation in the game. He believes that changes need to be made to re-ignite the interest of fans and players alike.</p>
  <p>Afridi emphasized the importance of introducing new formats and tournaments to attract a wider audience. He strongly believes that the evolution of cricket is necessary to keep up with the ever-changing sports industry. According to Afridi, the traditional Test and One-Day International (ODI) formats are losing their charm, and the focus should shift towards shorter and more exciting matches.</p>
  <p>The explosive cricketer mentioned the success of T20 cricket and its ability to engage fans with its fast-paced nature. Afridi feels that T20 matches provide an exhilarating experience, both for the players and the audience, and therefore, more emphasis should be given to this format. He suggested organizing more T20 tournaments globally, similar to the Indian Premier League (IPL), to capture the attention of cricket enthusiasts around the world.</p>
  <p>Afridi also talked about the need for innovation in cricket equipment and technology. He believes that advanced technology, such as the Decision Review System (DRS), has improved the accuracy of decision-making in the game. He urged cricket boards to invest in research and development to introduce more innovative tools and equipment that can enhance the overall experience for players and officials.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, Afridi expressed his concerns about the decline in the quality of pitches around the world. He believes that well-prepared pitches play a crucial role in ensuring exciting contests between bat and ball. He urged ground authorities and curators to focus on producing pitches that offer balance and fair competition between teams.</p>
  <p>The former Pakistani captain also highlighted the importance of player welfare and emphasized the need for sports associations to prioritize the physical and mental well-being of players. He stressed that excessive cricket schedules and frequent injuries can take a toll on a player's performance and overall interest in the game. According to Afridi, a balanced approach must be adopted, where players are given enough time to rest and recover between matches.</p>
