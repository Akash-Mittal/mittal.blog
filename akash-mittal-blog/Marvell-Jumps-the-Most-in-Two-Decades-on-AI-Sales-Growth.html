   <p>On a hot summer day in 1995, a young electrical engineer named Weili Dai made her way to the headquarters of a semiconductor company in Santa Clara, California. She was there for an interview with the company's co-founders, Sehat Sutardja and Pantas Sutardja.</p>
   <p>Despite being a recent college graduate with limited work experience, Dai impressed the Sutardja brothers. They offered her a job on the spot, and she went on to play a pivotal role in building the company, which eventually became known as Marvell Technology Group.</p>
   <p>Over the years, Marvell has grown into a major player in the technology industry, producing key components for a wide range of devices, from smartphones to self-driving cars. And now, the company is taking advantage of the growing trend in artificial intelligence, which is driving strong sales growth and lifting its share price higher.</p>
   <h2>A Look at Marvell's AI Sales Growth</h2>
   <p>Marvell has been investing heavily in AI in recent years, developing a range of products that help to power the technology. These include specialized chips that can process vast amounts of data quickly, as well as software that can analyze and draw insights from that data.</p>
   <p>As a result of these efforts, Marvell's sales in the AI market have been skyrocketing. In its most recent earnings report, the company reported that its data center business – which includes its AI products – grew by 16% year-over-year, with revenue reaching $305 million in the quarter.</p>
   <p>Overall, Marvell's revenue in the latest quarter was $832 million, up 20% from the same period a year earlier. This growth was due in large part to the strength of its data center business, as well as its networking business, which grew by 9% year-over-year.</p>
   <p>Investors were clearly impressed by these results, sending Marvell's share price up by more than 15% in the wake of the earnings report. This was the biggest single-day gain for the company's stock in more than two decades.</p>
