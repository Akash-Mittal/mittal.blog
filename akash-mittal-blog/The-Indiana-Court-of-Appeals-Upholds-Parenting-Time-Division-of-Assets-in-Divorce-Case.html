   <h2>An Interesting Story of a Divorce Case in Indiana</h2>
   <p>The divorce case of John and Jane Smith in Indiana was a heated and contested battle. The couple had been married for 10 years and had two young children. The main issue in the divorce was the division of parenting time and assets. John was seeking sole custody of the children, while Jane was requesting joint custody. John was also attempting to retain a larger portion of the couple's assets, as he was the primary breadwinner. The case went to court, and the judge ultimately ruled in favor of Jane, awarding her joint custody of the children and equal division of assets.</p>
