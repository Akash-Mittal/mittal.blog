   James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 Avoids Marvel's Cursed Second Weekend
  </header>
  <article>
   
   <p>It's no secret that Marvel Cinematic Universe movies tend to dominate the box office upon release. However, there's a strange phenomenon that has been happening in recent years: a significant drop in ticket sales during the second weekend. This trend has been labeled the "Marvel second weekend curse" by some, and it's been a cause of concern for movie studios and fans alike.</p>
   <p>But there's one movie that seems to be immune to this curse: James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy franchise. Both the first and second movies had strong second weekends, and now, as the release of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 approaches, fans and analysts are wondering if the trend will continue.</p>
   
   <p>Let's take a look at some numbers. According to Box Office Mojo, the average second-weekend drop for a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie is around 60%. Avengers: Endgame, the highest-grossing movie in the franchise, had a drop of 59.2% in its second weekend. Spider-Man: Far From Home, the latest release, had a drop of 51%.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, Guardians of the Galaxy had a drop of 56.6% in its second weekend, which is below average for the franchise. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 had an even smaller drop, at 47.5%. This suggests that the Guardians franchise not only attracts strong opening weekend numbers, but also has enough staying power to keep audiences coming back for more.</p>
   <h2> or Case Studies</h2>
   <p>As a fan of the Guardians franchise myself, I can attest to its unique charm and appeal. The combination of humor, heart, and classic rock music makes for a refreshing and exciting movie experience. But it's not just about the entertainment value - the characters and their relationships are what truly make the movies stand out.</p>
   <p>Take Groot, for example. He's a sentient tree with a limited vocabulary, but he manages to steal the show with his adorable antics and heartfelt moments. And then there's Peter Quill, aka Star-Lord, the charming rogue who struggles with his identity and his relationships with his team members.</p>
   <p>These characters have resonated with audiences around the world, and it's clear that James Gunn has a knack for bringing them to life on the big screen. This connection with the audience is what sets the Guardians franchise apart from other Marvel movies, and it's likely what contributes to its consistent second-weekend success.</p>
