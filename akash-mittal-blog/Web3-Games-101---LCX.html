  <h1>Web3 Games 101 - LCX</h1> <img src="./images/Web3-Games-101---LCX.jpeg" alt="+Web3 Games 101 - LCX+">
  <p>Web3 games are a new form of gaming that utilize blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. These games have been growing in popularity due to their decentralized nature and the potential for players to earn real money. LCX is one platform that has been at the forefront of the Web3 gaming revolution.</p>
  <h2>The Rise of Web3 Games</h2>
  <p>Web3 games have a fascinating origin story. It all started with the launch of the Ethereum blockchain in 2015. This allowed developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) that could execute smart contracts. One of the earliest dApps was CryptoKitties, a game where players could collect and breed digital cats. It became incredibly popular and caused congestion on the Ethereum network due to its high demand for transactions.</p>
  <p>Since then, Web3 games have evolved in numerous ways. Some of the latest games are more complex and immersive, with gameplay mechanics that are similar to traditional video games but with added rewards and incentives. Others have taken a more casual approach, with simple gameplay and real money prizes that are awarded based on luck or skill.</p>
  <h2>Real Life Examples</h2>
  <p>One popular Web3 game is Axie Infinity, a game that involves collecting and breeding creatures called Axies. Players can battle their Axies against other players and earn cryptocurrency in the form of Axie Infinity Shards (AXS) and Smooth Love Potions (SLP). Axie Infinity has become so popular that some players are earning enough money to support themselves as full-time players.</p>
  <p>Another example is ChainGuardian, a game that combines elements of tower defense and RPGs. Players can collect and train heroes, battle enemies, and earn cryptocurrency rewards. ChainGuardian recently launched an initial NFT sale, where players could purchase NFTs that grant access to special features and bonuses in the game.</p>
