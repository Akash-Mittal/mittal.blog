  <h1>The Rise of Generative AI and the Need for Regulation</h1> <img src="./images/2023-04-21-TheFutureofAIATieredApproachtoRegulation-18f97bba-75f0-43c9-afcf-ff1fe924d56f-answer.jpeg" alt="+The Future of AI: A Tiered Approach to Regulation+">
  <p>It's 2050 and you step into a crowded street, filled with people of all ages, races and cultures. As you walk by, you hear snippets of conversations in different languages, and see an array of futuristic gadgets and devices that make you feel like you've stepped into a Sci-fi movie. Suddenly, you notice something strange - the people around you are all wearing the same clothes, with the same logos and colours.</p>
  <p>What you've just witnessed is an example of generative AI - a type of artificial intelligence that can create its own content, such as images, music and even fashion. While this technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work, it also raises important ethical and legal questions.</p>
  <h2>Tiered Approach to Regulation: The Solution?</h2>
  <p>Recently, EU lawmakers have proposed a new approach to regulating generative AI: a tiered system based on the potential risks and benefits of the technology. This would mean that highly risky applications, such as those that can be used to create deepfakes or biologically dangerous substances, would face stricter regulations than those with smaller risks, such as those used in the fashion industry.</p>
  <p>This approach has received mixed reviews from experts in the field. Some argue that it may be too vague and difficult to apply in practice, while others see it as a step in the right direction towards creating a more nuanced and adaptable regulatory framework for AI.</p>
  <h2>Example</h2>
  <p>To better understand how a tiered approach to regulation could work, let's take a look at some concrete examples:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>A generative AI system used to create fashion designs would be considered low-risk and subject to minimal regulations.</li>
   <li>A generative AI system used to create fake news or deepfakes would be considered high-risk and subject to stricter regulations.</li>
   <li>A generative AI system used to create biologically dangerous substances would be considered extremely high-risk and subject to the most stringent regulations.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion: A Balancing Act</h2>
  <p>Ultimately, regulating generative AI will be a balancing act between promoting innovation and protecting society. While a tiered approach to regulation may not be perfect, it at least offers a starting point for creating a more informed and nuanced regulatory framework that is responsive to the needs and concerns of different industries and stakeholders.</p>
