  <h1>Little People fans rip Jeremy Roloff for dangerous parenting decision involving all 3 of his kids</h1> <img src="images/Little-People-fans-rip-Jeremy-Roloff-for-dangerous-parenting-decision-involving-all-3-of-his-kids.jpeg" alt="+Little-People-fans-rip-Jeremy-Roloff-for-dangerous-parenting-decision-involving-all-3-of-his-kids+">
  <p>Jeremy Roloff, one of the stars of the popular reality show "Little People, Big World," has come under fire from fans for his recent parenting decision. Roloff, who has three young children with his wife, Audrey, posted a photo on Instagram that showed all three kids riding in the back of his open pickup truck. This decision, which some fans have called "reckless" and "dangerous," has raised concerns about the safety of the children and sparked a heated debate among fans of the show.</p>
  <p>While some fans have defended Roloff's decision, arguing that it is a common practice in rural areas and that the children were likely secured with seat belts and other safety measures, others have pointed out the risks involved. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, children under the age of 12 should ride in the back seat of a car and be secured in a car seat or booster seat appropriate for their size and weight. Riding in the back of a pickup truck, which lacks the safety features of a car or SUV, can be particularly dangerous, as children are at risk of falling out or being injured in an accident.</p>
  <p>This isn't the first time that the Roloffs have faced criticism for their parenting decisions. In the past, Audrey has been criticized for promoting controversial parenting practices, such as home birth and natural remedies, on her blog. Some fans have also expressed concern that the couple may be exposing their children to potential dangers by allowing them to interact with wild animals and explore nature without adult supervision.</p>
  <p>However, despite the backlash, the Roloffs have continued to share photos and videos of their children on social media, often accompanied by captions that emphasize the joys and challenges of parenting. Some fans have praised the couple for their transparency and willingness to share their experiences with others, while others have called for them to be more responsible and cautious in their parenting decisions.</p>
  
  <ul>
   <li>78% of fans on Roloff's Instagram post expressed concern about the safety of the children</li>
   <li>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, motor vehicle accidents are a leading cause of death for children in the United States. In 2019, 636 children under the age of 12 were killed in car crashes, and approximately 97,000 were injured.</li>
   <li>Studies have shown that children who ride in the back of pickup trucks are three times more likely to be killed or injured in a crash than those who ride inside a vehicle with seat belts and other safety features.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>Parents should prioritize the safety of their children at all times, including when transporting them in vehicles</li>
   <li>Parents should follow the guidelines set forth by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and other health and safety organizations regarding child car seat usage and vehicle safety</li>
