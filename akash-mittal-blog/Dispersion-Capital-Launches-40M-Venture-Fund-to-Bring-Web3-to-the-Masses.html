   <li>Golem, a decentralized marketplace for computing power, enables users to rent out their idle computers to earn cryptocurrency</li>
   <li>OpenBazaar, a decentralized marketplace for buying and selling goods and services, eliminates the need for middlemen and allows buyers and sellers to transact directly with each other</li>
