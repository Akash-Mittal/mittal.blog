  <p>Remember the good old days when talking to someone face-to-face was the norm? Nowadays, more and more conversations are taking place online, thanks to video calls and messaging apps. However, with the rise in popularity of these tools, comes the issue of privacy and security. Brave, the privacy-focused web browser, has come to the rescue with its latest innovation - NFT gated video calls.</p>
  <h2>What are NFT gated video calls?</h2>
  <p>NFT gated video calls refer to a new kind of online conversation where access is granted only to those who own a unique Non-Fungible Token (NFT). These tokens are a form of digital asset that certifies ownership of a unique digital asset, such as a piece of artwork or a video clip. In the case of NFT gated video calls, owning the NFT grants access to the video conversation.</p>
  <h2>Why use NFT gated video calls?</h2>
  <p>The primary benefit of NFT gated video calls is increased privacy and security. By limiting access to those who own the NFT, Brave can ensure that only authorized users can join the conversation. Additionally, NFTs can be used to provide proof of ownership of digital content, making it easier to manage copyright issues.</p>
  <h2>Real-world examples</h2>
  <p>There are already a few real-world examples of NFT gated video calls being used. One such example is the Metakey project, which uses NFTs to grant access to private video calls. The NFTs in this case are created as part of a crowdfunding campaign to support the project. Another example is the recent auction of a digital portrait of Edward Snowden. The buyer of the portrait was granted access to a private video call with Snowden himself, which was gated by an NFT.</p>
  <h2>The future of online conversation</h2>
  <p>With the rise of privacy concerns and the need for increased security in online conversations, it's clear that there is a growing demand for new ways of communication. NFT gated video calls represent a step forward in this direction. By utilizing the power of blockchain technology, Brave, and other companies, are making it possible to have more secure and private online conversations.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In summary, NFT gated video calls are a new kind of online conversation that is both secure and private. They allow for proof of ownership of digital content and limit access to authorized users only. As more and more people look for ways to have secure conversations online, it's likely that we'll see more examples of this technology being used in the future.</p>
