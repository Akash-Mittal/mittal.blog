  <p>Mo Yan is a Chinese novelist and screenwriter who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2012 "for his hallmarks of the Chinese novel". He was the first Chinese national to be awarded the prize in that category and the second Asian. His real name is Guan Moye, but he writes under the pen name Mo Yan, which means "don't speak" in Chinese. He chose this pen name as a reminder to himself to always listen more than he talks.</p>
  <blockquote>
   "I think the essence of Chinese literature is rooted in the marvellous. Reality can disappoint us and even hurt us, but the marvellous can always bring us delight. In the context of the marvellous, the epic, the myths, the legends, the folktales, the ballads, the operas all become paradoxically true. The marvellous creates a form of new realism, a new reality, and thus embodies the spiritual essence of Chinese people."
