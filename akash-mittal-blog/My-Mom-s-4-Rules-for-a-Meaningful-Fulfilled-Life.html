   <h2>Why a Happiness Expert Says She 'Loves' Them</h2>

  <main>
   <p>When I was growing up, my mom always seemed to have a limitless supply of happiness. She was always smiling, always laughing, and always ready to lend a hand to anyone who needed it. It wasn't until I got older that I realized the secret to her happiness: she had four rules for living a meaningful, fulfilled life. And, as it turns out, her rules have been validated by a happiness expert.</p>
   <p>The first rule is to always make time for the things you love. My mom was passionate about hiking, so she made sure to set aside time each week to hit the trails. She also loved reading, so she always had a book nearby. Taking the time to pursue your passions is crucial for happiness, according to happiness expert Sonja Lyubomirsky, PhD. In fact, her research shows that people who regularly engage in activities they enjoy are more satisfied with their lives.</p>
   <p>The second rule is to prioritize relationships. My mom was an incredibly social person, and she always made time for her friends and family. It's no surprise, then, that research shows that social connections are a key factor in happiness. According to a study published in the Journal of Happiness Studies, people who have strong social connections report higher levels of life satisfaction.</p>
   <p>The third rule is to practice gratitude. My mom was always thankful for what she had, even when times were tough. This mindset of gratitude is important for happiness, as studies show that people who regularly practice gratitude are more optimistic and experience greater life satisfaction.</p>
   <p>The fourth rule is to take care of yourself. My mom was always mindful of her physical health, eating a balanced diet and staying active. However, taking care of yourself also means taking care of your mental health. My mom made sure to take breaks when she needed them, and she never let stress overwhelm her. According to research, people who take care of their mental and physical health are more likely to be happy.</p>
   <p>Of course, following these rules isn't a guarantee of happiness. Life can be messy and unpredictable, and we all have our own unique challenges to face. However, my mom's rules provide a strong foundation for a meaningful, fulfilled life. And, as Sonja Lyubomirsky has noted, happiness is a skill that can be developed over time. By incorporating these rules into your life, you can train yourself to be happier and more fulfilled.</p>

   <h3></h3>
   <p>When I was going through a tough time in my life, my mom's rules helped me stay grounded. Despite the challenges I was facing, I made sure to prioritize my friendships and hobbies. I started a gratitude journal, where I wrote down three things I was thankful for each day. And I made sure to take care of my mental and physical health, even when it was hard.</p>
   <p>Over time, I noticed that my mood improved and my outlook on life became more positive. While I still faced difficulties, I was able to handle them with more grace and resilience. My mom's rules had helped me develop a stronger sense of happiness and fulfillment.</p>
