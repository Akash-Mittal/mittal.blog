  <p>Story: Imagine you are in a remote meeting with your colleagues and your boss is giving a presentation. Suddenly, someone interrupts him with a legitimate question. But instead of answering, your boss asks that person to hold on for a moment, as he frantically types the answer into a search engine. Meanwhile, everyone's time is being wasted and the flow of the meeting is disrupted.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This scenario is not uncommon in remote meetings, but Slack is now introducing an AI-powered solution to make these meetings more productive and engaging.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Real-life examples: Slack's GPT algorithm will be able to attend remote meetings, called Huddles, and will assist in real-time conversation, as well as bring up relevant data and information when needed. For instance, if someone asks a question about a particular topic, the AI will swiftly retrieve the relevant information from the internet or company resources, and share it with everyone in the meeting.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The technology also has capabilities to offer language translation services with no apparent lag between spoken and translated languages, which is an exciting development for global, remote teams.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Main companies: Slack.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1) The introduction of Slack's GPT is poised to make remote meetings more efficient and productive.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2) By having an AI-powered assistant in meetings, workers will be able to maintain the flow of conversation and reduce downtime.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3) A notable advantage of the use of AI is the potential for meeting attendees who speak different languages to communicate simultaneously with the aid of the AI translation feature, making collaboration across borders a more straightforward process.</p>
