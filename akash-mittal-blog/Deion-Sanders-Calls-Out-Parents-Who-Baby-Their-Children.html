   <p>Deion Sanders, the retired American football player and sports analyst, has recently made headlines for his controversial comments on parenting. In an interview with ESPN, Sanders expressed his frustration with parents who coddle their children and shield them from the realities of life.</p>
   <p>Sanders revealed that he is often approached by parents who ask him to give their child a pep talk or mentor them. However, he feels that these parents are not doing their children any favors by sheltering them from failure and disappointment. "We're raising a generation of entitled, fragile kids who can't handle adversity and can't compete in the real world," Sanders said.</p>
   <h3>Quantifiable Examples</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>According to a survey conducted by the American College Health Association, the number of college students reporting anxiety or depression has risen from 50% in 2011 to 62% in 2016.</li>
    <li>In 2018, a Pew Research Center study found that 57% of parents with children aged 13 to 17 use tracking tools to monitor their child's digital activity.</li>
    <li>A study by the Association for Psychological Science found that children who were praised for their intelligence were more likely to cheat in a test than those who were praised for their effort.</li>
   </ol>
   <h3></h3>
   <ol>
    <li>Parents who shelter their children from adversity are doing them a disservice.</li>
    <li>Children need to learn how to handle failure and disappointment in order to develop resilience.</li>
    <li>By hovering over their children and shielding them from every challenge, parents are preventing them from developing self-sufficiency and independence.</li>
   </ol>
   <h3>Personal Anecdote</h3>
   <p>As a parent myself, I can relate to the desire to protect my children from harm and discomfort. However, I have come to realize that shielding them from every obstacle and challenge only hinders their growth and development. By allowing them to experience failure and disappointment, I am teaching them valuable life skills that will serve them well in the future.</p>
   <h3>Practical Tips for Parents</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Encourage your child to take risks and try new things, even if they might fail.</li>
    <li>Teach your child that it's okay to make mistakes, and that failure is an opportunity to learn and grow.</li>
    <li>Avoid hovering over your child or micromanaging their every move. Allow them to make their own decisions and learn from the consequences.</li>
   </ul>
