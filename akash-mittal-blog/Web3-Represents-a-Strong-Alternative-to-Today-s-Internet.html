   <p>Imagine a world where you could interact with people and services on the internet without worrying about privacy, censorship, and centralized control. A world where data is secure, ownership is transparent, and innovation is incentivized. This is the world that Web3 is trying to create.</p>
   <h2>What is Web3?</h2>
   <p>Web3 is the next generation of the internet, also known as the decentralized web or the blockchain web. It is built on decentralized protocols and technologies such as blockchain, IPFS, and smart contracts, which enable trust, transparency, and autonomy.</p>
   <p>A key feature of Web3 is the elimination of intermediaries and gatekeepers, such as social media platforms, search engines, and cloud providers, that control and exploit user data. Instead, Web3 is peer-to-peer, meaning that every user is a node in the network, contributing to the consensus and validation of transactions.</p>
   <h2>Why is Web3 important?</h2>
   <p>Web3 represents a strong alternative to today's internet, which is plagued by monopolies, surveillance, and manipulation. The following are some quantifiable examples of the problems with the current internet:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>90% of the world's data was created in the last two years, but less than 1% of the data is analyzed and used effectively.</li>
    <li>95% of the web is centralized, meaning that a few corporations control the flow of information and the monetization of user data.</li>
    <li>72% of the internet users have been victims of cybercrime, such as identity theft, data breaches, and phishing.</li>
    <li>70% of the internet revenues go to a handful of companies, such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon, leaving small businesses and creators at a disadvantage.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Web3 addresses these problems by offering:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Data sovereignty and ownership.</li>
    <li>Smart contracts that enforce pre-programmed rules and conditions.</li>
    <li>Incentives and rewards for participation and contribution to the network.</li>
    <li>Decentralized identity and reputation systems.</li>
    <li>Unstoppable and censorship-resistant applications and services.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>How can you get involved in Web3?</h2>
   <p>Web3 is still in its early stages of development, but there are already many projects and communities that are building and experimenting with decentralized technologies. Here are some practical tips on how you can get involved in Web3:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Learn about the basics of blockchain, smart contracts, and Web3 protocols.</li>
    <li>Experiment with decentralized apps, such as DeFi, NFTs, and social networks.</li>
    <li>Join Web3 communities, such as Ethereum, Polkadot, and Cosmos, and participate in discussions, events, and bounties.</li>
    <li>Become a validator or a node operator to secure and validate transactions on decentralized networks.</li>
    <li>Contribute to open-source projects that use Web3 technologies, such as IPFS, Arweave, and Filecoin.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, Web3 represents a strong alternative to today's internet, offering a more democratic, transparent, and resilient web. The Web3 ecosystem is still evolving, but the potential for innovation and impact is immense. Here are three key points to remember:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Web3 is the next generation of the internet, built on decentralized protocols and technologies.</li>
    <li>Web3 addresses the problems of the current internet, such as centralized control, surveillance, and exploitation.</li>
    <li>You can get involved in Web3 by learning, experimenting, contributing, and participating in communities.</li>

     <h2>From the Beginning</h2>
     <p>It all started with the creation of the internet in the 1960s. It was meant to be a decentralized network that allowed people to communicate and share information freely. However, over time, this vision was lost, and the internet became controlled by a few large corporations. These corporations now have the power to censor, delete, and manipulate the information we see online.</p>
     <p>There is a need for a new internet. An internet that is truly decentralized, giving back the power and control to the people.</p>

    <section id="quantifiable">
     <h2>Quantifiable Examples</h2>
     <p>The rise of Web3 presents us with the possibility of a new internet. A decentralized internet that is transparent, secure, and open to everyone.</p>
     <p>Here are some quantifiable examples of how Web3 can change our current internet:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>Elimination of intermediaries, resulting in lower costs for users</li>
      <li>Increased privacy, as users own their own data and have control over who can access it</li>
      <li>Decentralized platforms that cannot be shut down or censored</li>
