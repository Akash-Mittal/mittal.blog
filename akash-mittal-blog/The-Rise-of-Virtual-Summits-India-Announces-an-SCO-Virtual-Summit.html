  <p></p>
  <p>One day, I woke up to find that my work had become virtual - meetings, events, even job interviews were all taking place on my computer screen. While the circumstances that led to this were unfortunate, being able to attend a global summit from the comfort of my own home was certainly a convenience. It seems that world leaders are also adjusting to this new reality, as India announces that the upcoming Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit will be conducted in virtual mode.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The SCO is a Eurasian political, economic, and security alliance founded in 2001 by China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, with India and Pakistan joining as full members in 2017. The annual summit is an important forum for leaders to discuss regional security and economic cooperation. This year, the summit will be hosted by Russia, but due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it will take place virtually.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>India's decision to participate in a virtual summit is significant because it underscores the growing trend of virtual events and highlights the potential benefits of such arrangements. In this article, we will explore the rise of virtual summits and the reasons why they are gaining popularity.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable examples:</p>
  <p>- The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in virtual events. According to a report by Grand View Research, the virtual events market size was valued at USD 78.6 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.2% from 2020 to 2027.</p>
  <p>- In April 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) held its first virtual assembly, with over 170 countries participating. The assembly adopted a resolution calling for "intensified efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic and for equitable access to and fair distribution of all essential health technologies and products to combat the disease."</p>
  <p>- In June 2020, the G20 summit, which was originally scheduled to take place in Saudi Arabia, was also held virtually. Leaders from the world's largest economies discussed global economic recovery and coordinated strategies to address the pandemic.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Reasons for the rise of virtual summits:</p>
  <p>1. Cost and time savings: Virtual events eliminate the need for travel, accommodation, and venue rental, making them a more cost-effective option. They also save time, as participants can attend from anywhere in the world without having to take time off work and spend long hours in transit.</p>
  <p>2. Greater accessibility and inclusivity: Virtual summits make it easier for people with disabilities, those in remote areas, and those with limited resources to participate in important events. They also allow for greater diversity, as people from different backgrounds and regions can attend and share their perspectives.</p>
  <p>3. Environmental benefits: By eliminating the need for travel and physical venues, virtual summits have a significantly lower carbon footprint compared to traditional events. This contributes to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion:</p>
  <p>1. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the trend towards virtual events, and they are likely to become more common in the future.</p>
  <p>2. Virtual summits offer a range of benefits, including cost and time savings, greater accessibility and inclusivity, and environmental benefits.</p>
  <p>3. While virtual events cannot fully replace the value of face-to-face interactions, they offer a valuable alternative and complement to traditional events.</p>
