   <p>Jane had been skeptical about cryptocurrency for a long time. She had heard about Bitcoin but never really understood how it worked or why people were so excited about it. However, when she heard that Apple Pay was integrating with various Web3 apps, she decided to give it a try.</p>
   <p>It was surprisingly easy to set up and use. She simply added her credit card to her Apple Pay account and voila! She could buy and sell cryptocurrency on her phone as easily as she could make a payment at a store.</p>
   <p>Soon, she was hooked. She loved the idea of investing in digital assets and taking control of her finances in a way that wasn't possible with traditional banking. And she wasn't alone. More and more people were joining the Web3 revolution thanks to the integration of Apple Pay.</p>
   
   <p>The integration of Apple Pay has had a significant impact on the mass adoption of Web3. According to a recent survey, over 50% of people who use Apple Pay have tried or are interested in trying cryptocurrency. This is a huge shift from just a few years ago when most people had never even heard of cryptocurrency.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, since the launch of Apple Pay in 2014, it has become one of the most popular mobile payment platforms in the world. In 2020 alone, there were over 500 million transactions processed through Apple Pay. This massive user base means that the integration of Web3 technology can reach a wider audience than ever before.</p>
