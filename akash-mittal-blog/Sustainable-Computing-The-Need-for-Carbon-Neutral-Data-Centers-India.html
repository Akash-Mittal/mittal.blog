     <p>Imagine waking up one day to find out that half of the earth's population has become extinct due to climate change. Scary, isn't it? This is not just a hypothetical scenario, but a very real possibility if we don't take drastic measures to reduce our carbon footprint. The computing industry is one of the biggest contributors to carbon emissions, and data centers are at the forefront of this problem. It's time we start thinking about sustainable computing and carbon neutral data centers.</p>

    <section id="quantifiable">
     
     <p>Did you know that data centers in India consume around 4 billion kWh of electricity every year, which is expected to increase to 7.5 billion kWh by 2020? This accounts for almost 3% of India's total electricity consumption. This means that data centers in India contribute significantly to carbon emissions and global warming. According to a report by the Carbon Trust, moving to a carbon neutral data center could reduce the overall carbon footprint of a company by up to 30%. This is a significant reduction which can't be overlooked.</p>

     <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>Use energy-efficient hardware - When choosing hardware for your data center, opt for energy-efficient options that consume less power. Not only will this help reduce your carbon footprint, but it will also save you money in the long run.</li>
      <li>Virtualize your servers - Virtualizing your servers can help you reduce the number of physical servers you need, which can significantly reduce the amount of energy consumed by your data center.</li>
      <li>Invest in renewable energy - Consider investing in renewable energy to power your data center. Solar, wind, and hydro power are some of the options you can explore.</li>
     </ul>
