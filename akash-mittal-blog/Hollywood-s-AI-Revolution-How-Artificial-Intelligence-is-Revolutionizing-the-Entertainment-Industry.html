  <p>Imagine being a big Hollywood star who has just signed a new movie contract. You're excited to start filming, but you're also nervous because negotiations with the studio have been tense and exhausting. However, this time it's different - you have an AI on your side.</p>
  <p>AI is a key issue in negotiations between actors and Hollywood studios. From using AI to predict box office success to creating realistic CGI characters, artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the entertainment industry.</p>
  <h2>The Power of AI in Hollywood</h2>
  <p>AI is already being used by studios to determine which movies to greenlight. By analyzing data on past box office successes, AI can make predictions about what will be a hit and what will flop. It can also help studios identify which stars are the most bankable and what genres are popular with audiences.</p>
  <p>AI is also making waves in post-production. For example, a company called Reminiz is using AI to create lifelike CGI versions of deceased actors. By analyzing footage of the actor, the AI can create a 3D model that can be manipulated to create new performances. This technology has been used to bring back Peter Cushing's character Grand Moff Tarkin in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and a young version of Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia in Rogue One and The Rise of Skywalker.</p>
  <p>AI is also being used in the creation of realistic special effects and in the editing process. For instance, AI can be used to remove unwanted objects or people from a shot, or to remove blemishes or wrinkles from a performer's face. It can even be used to create realistic backgrounds for green screen shots.</p>
  
  <p>The impact of AI is already being felt in the entertainment industry. Here are a few quantifiable examples:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>Box Office Predictions:</strong> In 2019, AI accurately predicted the box office success of Avengers: Endgame, which went on to become the highest-grossing film of all time.</li>
   <li><strong>Avatar Sequels:</strong> Director James Cameron has announced that the forthcoming Avatar sequels will use AI to create more realistic CGI characters and environments.</li>
   <li><strong>Green Screen:</strong> AI has been used to create realistic backgrounds for green screen shots in many recent films, such as Blade Runner 2049 and The Irishman.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>It's clear that AI is rapidly changing the landscape of the entertainment industry. Here are three points to keep in mind:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>AI is being used in all aspects of film and television production, from pre-production to post-production.</li>
   <li>AI can be used to make accurate predictions about box office success and audience preferences.</li>
   <li>AI is allowing filmmakers to push the boundaries of what is possible with special effects and CGI.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>In conclusion, AI is transforming the entertainment industry in ways that were once thought impossible. As the technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more groundbreaking applications in the future.</p>
