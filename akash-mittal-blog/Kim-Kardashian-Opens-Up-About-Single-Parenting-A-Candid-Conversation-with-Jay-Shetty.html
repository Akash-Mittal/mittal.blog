    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>Kim Kardashian sat down with Jay Shetty for a candid conversation, opening up about her experience with single parenting. As a mother of four, she has faced many challenges balancing work and motherhood on her own. During the podcast, she shared personal anecdotes and offered practical tips for other single parents out there.</p>
    <p>Kim revealed that one of the biggest challenges she faced was learning to prioritize her time and energy. With four young children and a thriving business to run, she constantly found herself pulled in different directions. "It's so important to set boundaries and know when to say no," she said. "That way, you can give your full attention to whatever it is that you're doing at that moment."</p>
    <p>For Kim, being a single parent also meant focusing on mental health and self-care. She talked about the importance of taking time for herself, whether it's a bubble bath or a yoga class. "When you prioritize your own well-being, you're better equipped to handle all the challenges that come with being a single parent," she explained.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>Kim Kardashian's experience with single parenting is not unique. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there were approximately 13.6 million single parents in the country in 2020. Of those, 80% were mothers.</p>
    <p>Single parents face a number of unique challenges, including financial strain, lack of support, and feelings of isolation. Studies show that single parents are more likely to experience mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety, due to the stress of raising children on their own.</p>
    <p>However, single parenting can also have positive effects on both the parent and the children. Research shows that children raised by single parents are more likely to be independent and resilient, and they often develop strong relationships with their parent as a result. Single parents are also more likely to prioritize their children's education and well-being, as they take on the responsibility of raising them on their own.</p>
