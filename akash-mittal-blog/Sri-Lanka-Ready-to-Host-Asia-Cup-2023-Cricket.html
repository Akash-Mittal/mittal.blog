    <h3>Preparations in Place</h3>
    <p>Well, for starters, the Sri Lankan government has allocated enough funds to ensure that all infrastructure and facilities are in top-notch condition. This includes stadium renovations, transportation, accommodation, and security measures. In addition, all necessary permissions have been granted, and a task force has been set up to oversee the smooth running of the tournament.</p>
    <p>According to Sri Lanka Cricket's CEO, Ashley de Silva, "We have a detailed plan in place, which we are confident will be executed to perfection. We want to provide an unforgettable experience for both teams and fans, and we are doing everything in our power to make that happen."</p>
    <p>An important factor in the success of any major sporting event is the availability of high-quality training facilities. Sri Lanka is no slouch in this department, as the country boasts some of the best cricket grounds in the world, including the R. Premadasa Stadium and the Galle International Stadium.</p>
