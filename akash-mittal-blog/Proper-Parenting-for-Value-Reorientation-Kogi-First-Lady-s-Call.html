  <h1>Proper Parenting for Value Reorientation</h1> <img src="images/Proper-Parenting-for-Value-Reorientation-Kogi-First-Lady-s-Call.jpeg" alt="+Proper-Parenting-for-Value-Reorientation-Kogi-First-Lady-s-Call+">
  <div class="box">
   <p>On this Children's Day, the First Lady of Kogi State has called for proper parenting in order to ensure value reorientation in children. Speaking at a ceremony organized by the Kogi State Parent-Teacher Association (PTA), Mrs Rashida Bello emphasized the importance of instilling good values in children from an early age.</p>
   <p>"As parents, we have a duty to guide our children and to cultivate in them a sense of morality and responsibility," she said. "We must teach them the difference between right and wrong, and we must lead by example."</p>
   <p>Mrs Bello went on to provide some examples of the kinds of values that parents should be instilling in their children:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Honesty and integrity</li>
    <li>Respect for others</li>
    <li>Responsibility and accountability</li>
    <li>Compassion and empathy</li>
    <li>Tolerance and acceptance of diversity</li>
   </ul>
   <p>She stressed that these values are essential for building a just and equitable society, and that it is the responsibility of parents to ensure that their children understand their importance.</p>
   <p>"The future of our society rests with our children," she said. "We must do all that we can to nurture and guide them, so that they can grow up to be responsible and productive members of society."</p>
  </div>
  <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
  <p>In order to drive home her message, Mrs Bello shared some personal anecdotes and case studies that illustrate the importance of proper parenting and value reorientation.</p>
  <div class="quote">
   <p>"I have seen firsthand the damage that can be done when parents neglect their responsibilities," she said. "I have seen children who grew up without guidance or discipline, who lacked the basic values that are needed to be a good citizen."</p>
  </div>
  <p>One of the case studies that Mrs Bello shared involved a young girl who was caught stealing from a classmate. When the girl's parents were called to the school to discuss the matter, they were defensive and dismissive of the school's concerns. They argued that their daughter was "just being a kid" and that the school was overreacting.</p>
  <p>"This is a classic example of irresponsible parenting," Mrs Bello said. "Instead of acknowledging their daughter's wrongdoing and taking steps to correct it, these parents chose to make excuses and to shift the blame onto others."</p>
  <p>Another case study involved a group of teenage boys who were caught vandalizing public property. When the boys' parents were called to the police station, they were shocked and indignant. They couldn't believe that their sons would do such a thing, and they refused to accept any responsibility for the damage that had been done.</p>
  <p>"These parents were in denial," Mrs Bello said. "They refused to see that their children had made a mistake, and they refused to take any action to correct it. As a result, their sons continued to engage in destructive behavior."</p>
  <p>These anecdotes serve as powerful reminders of the importance of proper parenting and value reorientation. Good parenting isn't just about providing for your children's physical needs; it's also about providing for their emotional and spiritual needs, and instilling in them the values that will help them to be successful and responsible members of society.</p>
  <h2>Practical Tips for Parents</h2>
  <p>If you're a parent who is interested in instilling good values in your children, here are some practical tips that you can use:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Lead by example. Children learn by watching their parents, so be sure to model the kind of behavior that you want to see in your children.</li>
   <li>Communicate with your children. Talk to them about your values and why they're important. Encourage them to ask questions and to share their own thoughts and ideas.</li>
   <li>Establish clear rules and consequences. Children thrive when they know what is expected of them and what will happen if they don't meet expectations.</li>
   <li>Encourage responsibility and accountability. Give your children age-appropriate tasks and responsibilities, and hold them accountable for their actions.</li>
   <li>Praise good behavior. When your children exhibit the values that you're trying to instill, be sure to praise them and let them know that you're proud of them.</li>
  </ol>
