    <p>It was the year 2025, and the news industry was facing a major crisis due to the rise of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence program that was capable of producing news articles in real time. The newsrooms were buzzing with the news of how ChatGPT was taking over the industry, and many journalists were worried about losing their jobs.</p>
    <p>Barry Diller, the media mogul and owner of IAC/InterActiveCorp, was not one to sit idly by and watch his industry crumble. He got together with a group of journalists, editors, and tech experts to come up with a plan to stop ChatGPT from destroying the news business.</p>
    <p>The first step was to create a new platform that would give journalists the tools they needed to produce high-quality, in-depth reporting. They launched a new website called NewsBreak, which would be a hub for journalists to share their stories and work together on investigative pieces.</p>
    <p>Next, they partnered with major newspapers and magazines to create a subscription service that would give readers access to the best reporting from around the world. This service, called NewsPass, would be available on all devices and would offer exclusive content and features.</p>
    <p>To compete with ChatGPT, the team also developed their own AI program, called NewsBrain, which would help journalists sift through data and identify important trends and stories.</p>
    <p>The plan worked. NewsBreak and NewsPass became hugely popular among readers, and journalists flocked to the platform to share their work. The news industry was saved from the threat of ChatGPT, and journalists could continue to do what they do best.</p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>NewsBreak received over 10 million page views in its first month</li>
     <li>NewsPass reached 1 million subscribers in its first year</li>

    </ul>
