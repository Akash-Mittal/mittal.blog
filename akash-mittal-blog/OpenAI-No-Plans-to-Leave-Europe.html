    <h2>The Story of OpenAI</h2>
    <p>OpenAI is a research firm that was founded in 2015 by a group of high-profile Silicon Valley executives, including Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, John Schulman, and Wojciech Zaremba. The company's goal is to create safe and reliable artificial intelligence that can be used for the benefit of humanity.</p>
    <p>Since its founding, OpenAI has become one of the most influential players in the AI industry, developing cutting-edge technologies and partnering with major companies and institutions around the world. In recent years, however, there have been concerns over the future of AI in the EU, particularly in light of new regulations and policies that could impact research and development in the industry.</p>
    <p>In response to these concerns, OpenAI has announced that it has no plans to leave Europe.
