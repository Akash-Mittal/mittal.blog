  <p>Choosing a name for a baby is a big decision that parents agonize over. Some parents may have regret over their initial choice, and decide to change it. But what happens when the regret doesn't go away after one change, and the name is changed again? One mother shares her story of shame over her baby name regret.</p>
  <h2>The Story</h2>
  <p>When Kate was pregnant with her first child, she and her husband spent hours poring over baby name books. They wanted a name that was unique, but not too unusual. They finally settled on a name that they both loved, and shared it with family and friends who all thought it was a great choice.</p>
  <p>When their daughter was born, Kate and her husband proudly declared their chosen name. However, as time passed, Kate began to feel uncomfortable with the name. It just didn't seem to fit her daughter, who had a different personality than what they had imagined. Kate started to have serious regret over their choice of name. She tried to ignore the feeling, but it only grew stronger.</p>
  <p>After several months of internal struggle, Kate and her husband decided they needed to change their daughter's name. They felt embarrassed and ashamed, but knew it was the right decision for their family. They chose a new name that they felt fit their daughter much better, and announced it to friends and family.</p>
  <p>But the regret didn't go away. Kate still didn't feel satisfied with the new name. She couldn't shake the feeling that they had made the wrong choice again. Eventually, they decided to change their daughter's name for the second time. This time, they chose a name that felt perfect for their daughter's personality, and finally, they felt they had made the right choice.</p>
  
  <p>Kate's story is not unique. In fact, according to a survey conducted by online parenting community BabyCenter, 20% of parents say they regret the name they chose for their child. Of those, 25% went so far as to change their child's name within the first year. Another study found that over 6,000 children in the UK were given a new name in 2018, with parents admitting to feeling "naming regret."</p>
  <p>This trend has not gone unnoticed by the baby name industry. Many companies now offer name change services, and some even offer insurance policies to protect against future regret.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Choosing a name for your child is an important decision, and it's understandable that parents would feel pressure to get it right. But it's important to remember that a name does not define a person. Your child's personality and achievements are what truly matter.</p>
  <p>If you're feeling regret over your child's name, it's okay to consider a change. But before you make any big decisions, take some time to reflect on why you're feeling this way. Is it truly about the name, or is it something else?</p>
  <p>Finally, don't be too hard on yourself. It's natural to make mistakes as a parent. The most important thing is that you're doing what's best for your child.</p>
