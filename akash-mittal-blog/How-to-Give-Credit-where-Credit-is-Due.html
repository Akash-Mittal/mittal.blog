   <h2 class="subtitle">The Importance of Giving Credit</h2>
   <p class="article">Have you ever worked hard on a project or task, only to see someone else take credit for it? Or have you ever seen someone else do the same to one of your colleagues or friends? It's frustrating, demotivating, and just plain wrong. Giving credit where credit is due is not just a matter of good manners or ethics, it's also a matter of fairness, respect, and recognition. When you give credit to others, you acknowledge their contributions, you validate their efforts, and you build trust, loyalty, and a sense of community. Moreover, when you give credit to others, you also enhance your own reputation, your own credibility, and your own leadership. By showing that you are humble, generous, and collaborative, you inspire others to follow your example, and you create a culture of excellence and innovation.</p>
   <h2 class="subtitle">The Challenges of Giving Credit</h2>
   <p class="article">Despite the benefits of giving credit, many people still struggle with how to do it effectively. One of the main challenges is to know whom to credit and how much to credit. Should you credit everyone who has contributed to the project, or just the main players? Should you credit each contribution separately, or just mention the overall team effort? Should you credit people by name, title, or function? Another challenge is to know when and where to credit. Should you credit people during the project, after the project, or both? Should you credit people publicly, privately, or both? Should you credit people in writing, in person, or both? Yet another challenge is to know how to credit. Should you use a formal or informal tone? Should you use a specific format or style? Should you use a short or long message? Should you use a general or specific message? These are all valid questions, and the answer depends on the context, the culture, and the goal. However, there are some general principles and best practices that can help you navigate these challenges.</p>
   <h2 class="subtitle">Tips for Giving Credit</h2>
   <p class="article">Here are some tips for giving credit where credit is due:</p>
   <ol class="article">
    <li>Be specific: When you give credit, be sure to mention the name, title, function, or contribution of the person(s) involved. Don't just say "great job", say "great job, John, for coming up with the idea of using social media for our campaign".</li>
    <li>Be timely: When you give credit, do it as soon as possible, and don't wait until the end of the project or the evaluation. This shows that you value the contribution and that you are aware of the progress. Don't assume that people know that they are appreciated.</li>
    <li>Be sincere: When you give credit, mean it. Don't just give lip service or fake compliments. People can sense when you are insincere or opportunistic. If you don't feel comfortable giving credit, ask yourself why. Maybe you need to work on your own self-esteem or your own biases.</li>
    <li>Be comprehensive: When you give credit, try to include everyone who has contributed in a meaningful way, not just the star players or the obvious choices. This shows that you recognize the diversity and the complexity of the team, and that you appreciate the different perspectives and skills. This also shows that you care about the well-being and the development of each member.</li>
    <li>Be public: When you give credit, do it in a public setting, so that others can see and learn from the example. This creates a positive atmosphere and a sense of accountability. This also creates a sense of pride and motivation for the team, and a sense of trust and loyalty for the leader. This doesn't mean that you should put people on the spot or embarrass them, but rather that you should celebrate their achievements openly and respectfully.</li>
   </ol>
   <p class="article">Of course, these tips are not exhaustive or prescriptive, and you may need to adjust them to your own situation and style. But the point is that giving credit is not rocket science, it's a matter of common sense and empathy. Just put yourself in the shoes of the person(s) you want to credit, and imagine how you would like to be treated.</p>
   <h2 class="subtitle">Examples of Giving Credit</h2>
