   <p>Being a parent, whether single or not, is never easy. But when you add the pressure of the public eye and the scrutiny that comes with it, the challenges can seem insurmountable. This is the reality for Kim Kardashian who, despite her fame and fortune, faces the daily struggles of single parenting.</p>
   <h2>The Numbers Speak for Themselves</h2>

   <p>The numbers become more worrying when you start to consider the effects on children raised in single-parent homes. The same U.S. Census Bureau report says that these children are more likely to drop out of school, become pregnant at a young age or face incarceration.</p>

   <p>Kim Kardashian also understands the importance of maintaining a healthy relationship with her children. She often talks about how she tries to be "present" for them, whether it's reading them bedtime stories or attending their school events.</p>
   <p>Another common issue faced by single parents is navigating the complexities of co-parenting. Kim Kardashian has faced her fair share of custody battles and disagreements with her ex-partner, Kanye West. She has been candid about the challenges, but also the sense of relief she feels when they can come to an agreement. "Co-parenting is hard," she says, "But we make it work for the kids."</p>
