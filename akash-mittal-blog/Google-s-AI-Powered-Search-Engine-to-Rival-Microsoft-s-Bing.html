  <h1>The Rise of Google's AI Powered Search Engine</h1> <img src="images/Google-s-AI-Powered-Search-Engine-to-Rival-Microsoft-s-Bing.jpeg" alt="+Google-s-AI-Powered-Search-Engine-to-Rival-Microsoft-s-Bing+">
  <p>For many years, Google has been the dominant player in the search engine space. However, in recent years, Microsoft's Bing search engine has been gaining ground. In response to this threat, Google has unveiled an AI powered search engine that promises to revolutionize the way we search for information online.</p>
  
  <p>The story of Google's AI powered search engine begins in 2015 when Google acquired a British startup called DeepMind. DeepMind is a company that specializes in the development of artificial intelligence technologies. One of the technologies that DeepMind is particularly good at is called deep learning.</p>
  <p>Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain, known as artificial neural networks. These algorithms are designed to learn from large sets of data and improve over time.</p>
  <p>Google recognized the potential of deep learning and decided to use it to improve its search engine. The result is a search engine that is faster, more accurate, and more intelligent than anything we've seen before.</p>
  
  <p>So, what does this AI powered search engine look like in action? Here are some quantifiable examples:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Google's AI can now understand complex queries, such as "What are the best Italian restaurants in New York City?" and return relevant results.</li>
   <li>Google's AI can now understand context and intent. For example, if you search for "John Lennon," the search results will be different if you're looking for information on the musician or the artist.</li>
   <li>Google's AI can now provide answers to questions directly in the search results. For example, if you ask "What is the capital of France?" you'll see the answer at the top of the page.</li>
  </ul>
