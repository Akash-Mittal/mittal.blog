   <p>On a warm summer day, Elizabeth was sitting on her porch, contemplating her future. She was four months pregnant and unsure of how she was going to manage financially. Her job didn't offer maternity leave and she didn't have any other source of income.</p>
   <p>As she was lost in thought, a woman approached her and introduced herself as a pregnancy counselor. She gave Elizabeth information about a local program that provided financial support for pregnant women. Thanks to this program, Elizabeth was able to take a leave of absence from work and focus on her health and the health of her baby.</p>
   <p>Elizabeth's story is just one example of the many women who will benefit from the recent ruling by the Supreme Court in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. The ruling paves the way for states to enact laws that protect unborn children from abortion after 15 weeks of gestation.</p>
   <h2> Support</h2>
   <p>Following the Dobbs ruling, Texas lawmakers have taken steps to provide more support for pregnant women. The state has already implemented various programs that offer practical and financial support, such as:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Maternity leave provisions for state employees</li>
    <li>Expansion of Medicaid coverage for pregnant women</li>
    <li>Access to prenatal care and childbirth education classes</li>
    <li>Programs that provide free or subsidized baby supplies</li>
   </ul>
   <p>These programs have already helped many women, such as:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Over 100,000 Texas women received prenatal care through Medicaid in 2019.</li>
    <li>The Texas Pregnancy Care Network has helped over 10,000 women find pregnancy support services.</li>
    <li>The Texas Diaper Bank has distributed over 1 million diapers to families in need.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion: Supporting Pregnant Women in Three Points</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Pregnancy can be a challenging and difficult time, especially for women who lack financial resources or social support.</li>
    <li>States have a responsibility to provide practical and financial support for pregnant women, regardless of whether they choose to carry their pregnancy to term or seek an abortion.</li>
    <li>By implementing programs and laws that support pregnant women, Texas lawmakers are taking positive steps towards protecting the health and wellbeing of mothers and babies.</li>
   </ol>
