   <h1>Is AI about to cripple the film and TV industry in New York?</h1> <img src="images/Albany-threatens-tax-breaks-for-film-and-TV-industry-over-AI.jpeg" alt="+Albany-threatens-tax-breaks-for-film-and-TV-industry-over-AI+">

   <p>Joe, an aspiring actor, moves to New York City to make it big in the film and TV industry. He shows up to audition after audition, but to no avail. One day, he overhears a group of casting directors talking about an AI program that can identify the perfect actor for any role based on their past performances and physical attributes.</p>
   <p>Joe is shocked and devastated, realizing that years of hard work and dedication may mean nothing in the face of this advancing technology. He isn't alone; the film and TV industry in New York as a whole is feeling the effects of AI and its potential to replace human talent.</p>
   <h2>The problem with AI in the film and TV industry</h2>
   <p>AI has the ability to analyze past performances, facial features, and even physical movements to identify the ideal actor for a particular role. This can significantly cut down on casting time and costs, and can even result in more accurate casting decisions. However, it also raises questions about the future of the film and TV industry as a whole.</p>
   <p>With the advent of new technologies like AI, there is potential for many jobs to become automated in the near future. This includes jobs like casting directors, camera operators, and even writers. The film and TV industry in New York employs thousands of people, and the threat of automation has many worried about the long-term future of their careers.</p>
   <h2>Quantifiable examples of AI in the film and TV industry</h2>
   <p>The impact of AI on the film and TV industry can already be seen in action. For example, there is an AI program called ScriptBook that is designed to analyze film scripts and predict their box office success. According to a study by the European Commission, ScriptBook is able to predict box office revenue with 84% accuracy.</p>
   <p>There is also an AI program called Flowbox that is designed to streamline the process of visual effects. This program can automatically apply visual effects to a scene, taking away the need for manual labor and cutting down on the time and cost of post-production.</p>
   <h2>Albany threatens tax breaks for the film and TV industry</h2>
   <p>In an effort to combat the potential loss of jobs in the film and TV industry due to automation, Albany has threatened to remove tax breaks for studios that use AI. These tax breaks were designed to lure studios to film in New York, but Albany fears that they will take jobs away from traditional human roles in the industry.</p>
   <p>While this decision may seem like a measure to slow down the growth of automation, it could also have negative consequences for New York's economy. Other states and countries offer similar tax breaks, and if New York removes them, studios may take their business elsewhere. This could lead to a significant loss of revenue for the state and hinder its ability to compete in the global film and TV industry.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>AI is becoming increasingly prevalent in the film and TV industry, raising concerns about the future of human jobs in the industry.</li>
    <li>There are already quantifiable examples of how AI is being used to streamline production and cut costs in the industry.</li>
    <li>While Albany's decision to remove tax breaks may seem like a way to slow down the growth of automation, it could also have negative consequences for the state's economy and its ability to compete globally in the industry.</li>
