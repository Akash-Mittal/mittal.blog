   <h2>The Importance of Prioritizing Fun in Gaming Industry</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>As a gamer, have you ever found yourself playing a game that was promoted as innovative and technologically advanced, only to find it lacking in the most important aspect - fun?</p>
   <p>Azra Games CEO, who is known for his philosophy of prioritizing fun over all else, believes that the gaming industry needs to focus on creating games that are enjoyable and engaging for the players, rather than just focusing on the latest and greatest Web3 technology. This philosophy has made waves in the industry and sparked a debate about what truly makes a great game.</p>
   <h3>Examples From Real Life</h3>
   <p>Azra Games is not alone in this philosophy. Other gaming companies, such as Nintendo, have also prioritized fun over technology in their game development process. The success of Nintendo's Switch console and its games, such as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing: New Horizons, are proof that this approach can lead to both critical and commercial success.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, there are examples of games that prioritize technology over fun, resulting in lackluster player experiences. The highly anticipated Cyberpunk 2077, which was marketed heavily for its advanced technology and immersive world, was plagued with bugs and glitches that severely impacted the gameplay. As a result, players were left unsatisfied and disappointed, despite the game's promising technology.</p>
   <h3>The Importance of Focusing on Fun</h3>
   <p>Azra Games CEO's philosophy on prioritizing fun over Web3 technology is based on the belief that games should be created primarily to entertain and engage players, rather than just to showcase the latest technological advancements. By prioritizing fun, gaming companies can create games that stand the test of time and build a loyal following of players who appreciate enjoyable gameplay and engaging mechanics.</p>
   <h3>The Takeaway</h3>
   <p>While Web3 technology is undoubtedly a major component of the gaming industry's future, Azra Games CEO's philosophy reminds us that the most important aspect of a game is its ability to entertain and engage players. Gaming companies should focus on creating games that are both technologically advanced and fun to play.</p>
