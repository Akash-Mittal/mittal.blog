   <h2>How Does the New Gmail Search UI Look Like?</h2>
   <p>The new Gmail search interface aims to provide a uniform and seamless experience across different platforms, be it mobile or desktop. The UI is minimalist and easy on the eyes, with a prominent search bar located at the top of the screen. The search bar expands upon clicking, providing more filtering options such as:</p>
   <ul>

    <li>Search by attachments: This filter option is a major plus for users who are frequently searching for mails with attachments. The attachment filter categorizes all mails with attachments, making search time-efficient.</li>
    <li>Search by category: This option sorts emails into five categories- Primary, Social, Promotions, Updates, and Forums. Users can select a specific category and search for mails under it. This feature allows users to keep track of their emails in a more organized manner.</li>
    <li>Search by keywords: Users now have the option to search for specific keywords or phrases in the "All Mail" section to find relevant mails.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The new UI is not just limited to the search bar, but users can also see the most recent search history by clicking on the Search History tab, located below the search bar. The search history tab displays the list of recently searched items in the order of most accessed mails.</p>
