   <p>As many seniors choose to stay at home for their aging years, the number of in-home caregivers increases. Unfortunately, a lack of understanding and awareness about potential blind spots in caregiving can put seniors at risk. Recently, ChatGPT researchers found that artificial intelligence tools used by caregivers may have limitations and can overlook crucial information.</p>
   <p>While interviewing a group of caregivers from different companies, researchers found that a common practice was for caregivers to use AI technologies to monitor seniors throughout the day. However, they discovered that these technologies often miss important information that a human caregiver could catch. For example, the AI may not pick up on changes in appetite or mood, which could be a sign of a bigger health issue. This can lead to serious consequences for seniors who may not receive the care they need.</p>
   <p>Real-life examples of this issue include cases where AI technology did not alert a caregiver to a senior's fall or a change in their vital signs. In one case, an AI tool did not detect a gas leak that could have been deadly for the senior living in the home. These examples show how blind spots in caregiving can have life-threatening consequences.</p>
   <p>The companies that were found to have blind spots in their caregiving practices include:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.caring.com/">Caring.com</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.homeinstead.com/">Home Instead</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.visitingangels.com/">Visiting Angels</a></li>
   </ul>
   <p>It is important for senior care companies to take note of these blind spots and alter their practices accordingly. While AI technology can be a helpful tool in caregiving, it should not be solely relied upon. Caregivers should be properly trained to recognize potential issues and should use their own judgement when caring for seniors.</p>
