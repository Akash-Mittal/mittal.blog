  <h1>Co-Parenting: Kim and Jerald’s Journey</h1> <img src="images/Co-Parenting-Kim-and-Jerald-s-Journey.jpeg" alt="+Co-Parenting-Kim-and-Jerald-s-Journey+">
  <p>Imagine this: You’re an actor and your partner is also in the same field. During your relationship, you both starred in a television series and fell in love. However, after a few years, you broke up, and it seemed like you would never talk to each other again. But then, fate intervenes, and you both find out that you’re going to be parents. How do you move on from romantic fallout to co-parenting?</p>
  <p>This is the true story of Kim Chiu and Gerald Anderson, two prominent Filipino actors who starred in the television series “Sana Maulit Muli” in 2007. Their on-screen romance transcended the screen and turned into a real-life relationship, but unfortunately, they broke up in 2010. In 2019, Kim and Gerald were reunited, not for a romantic relationship, but for the purpose of co-parenting.</p>
  <h2>Co-Parenting: Three Tips from Kim and Jerald</h2>
  <p>Kim and Jerald’s journey as co-parents has not been easy, but they’ve managed to make it work for the sake of their child. Here are three tips that can help other co-parents navigate the complexities of raising a child after a break-up:</p>
  <h3>1. Respect each other’s boundaries.</h3>
  <p>When Kim and Jerald decided to co-parent, they also decided to set clear boundaries for each other. This meant that they would not interfere in each other’s personal lives, nor would they badmouth each other to their child. By respecting each other’s boundaries, they’ve managed to create a positive co-parenting environment that benefits their child.</p>
  <h3>2. Keep communication open and honest.</h3>
  <p>Communication is key in co-parenting, and it’s something that Kim and Jerald have worked hard on. They make sure that they are always available for each other, whether it’s for discussing their child’s needs or just checking in on each other’s well-being. When they do have disagreements, they make sure to address it with open and honest communication, instead of letting it fester and turn into resentment.</p>
  <h3>3. Prioritize your child’s needs.</h3>
  <p>The most important thing for Kim and Jerald is their child’s well-being. They’ve realized that co-parenting is not about their own wants and needs, but about what’s best for their child. They make sure to attend important events together, such as their child’s school activities, and they’ve even spent holidays as a family to make sure that their child feels loved and supported.</p>
  <h2>The Benefits of Co-Parenting</h2>
  <p>Co-parenting can be challenging, but it also has its benefits. Here are some quantifiable examples of how co-parenting can positively affect a child’s life:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Improved mental health: Children who have two supportive parents, even if they are not living together, have better mental health.</li>
   <li>Higher academic success: Children living in a co-parenting setup tend to have better academic performance and higher achievement rates.</li>

  </ul>
