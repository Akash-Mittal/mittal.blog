   <p>It was just another typical day for the residents of Madison and Hanna Avenues until a loud bang startled them. People rushed to the roads to see what was going on and they were shocked to see a large hole in the middle of the road. The water main had broken and it had left a huge gap in the pavement. The water was gushing out of the broken pipe and flooding the area. The pipe was old and badly corroded. The water company had no choice but to shut off the water supply to the area to prevent further damage.</p>
   <p>The residents were left without water for several hours and had to rely on bottled water to meet their needs. The water company worked tirelessly to fix the broken pipe and restore the water supply to the area. The repair work took more than a day and it caused a lot of inconvenience to the residents of Madison and Hanna Avenues.</p>
   
   <p>The water main break caused significant damage to the road and the surrounding area. The repair work cost the water company thousands of dollars.
