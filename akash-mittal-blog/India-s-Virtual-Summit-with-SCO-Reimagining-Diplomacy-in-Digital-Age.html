  <p></p>
  <p>Once upon a time, diplomacy was all about in-person interactions, endless handshakes, and sealed envelopes. However, the global pandemic has upended the traditional notions of diplomacy, forcing countries to innovate and adapt. In such unprecedented times, India is all set to host the 22nd summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) virtually on July 4th, with PM Modi at the helm.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>SCO is a regional intergovernmental organization founded in 2001, comprising eight member states- India, China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. SCO's main objective is to foster trust, peace, and stability in the Eurasian region.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This year's summit theme is "Digital SCO: Stable Innovation Growth." It aims to promote digital technologies and innovative solutions, paving the way for a sustainable future. The summit's virtual format will leverage technology to enhance collaboration, limit travel, and prioritize safety.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p> SCO's Significance</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>SCO has emerged as a critical multinational platform in the region, showcasing India's commitment to fostering regional cooperation and connectivity. Here are a few quantifiable examples:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Economic Cooperation: SCO is the largest regional organization in the world in terms of land area, population, and the diversity of cultures and economies. Its member states account for over 40% of the world's population and one-fifth of the global GDP.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Military Partnership: SCO's military exercises build trust, enhance interoperability, and promote peace and stability in the region. In 2020, India hosted a successful joint military exercise with SCO partner countries, demonstrating its growing military collaboration.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. COVID-19 Response: SCO has stepped up its efforts to combat COVID-19, including the exchange of medical supplies, vaccines, and best practices. India's "Vaccine Maitri" initiative, which provided free vaccines to SCO and other countries, has been lauded as a critical step in fighting the pandemic.</p>
  <p></p>
