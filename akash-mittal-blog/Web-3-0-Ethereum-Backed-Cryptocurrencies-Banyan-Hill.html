   <h3>The 3 Key Points on Web 3.0</h3>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>Ethereum and cryptocurrencies are the foundation of Web 3.0.</strong> Unlike the centralized web we know today, the decentralized web of the future will be powered by blockchain technology. Ethereum is the blockchain that has emerged as the most popular platform for creating decentralized applications, thanks to its smart contract functionality.</li>
    <li><strong>Web 3.0 offers greater privacy, security, and control for users.</strong> With the current web, users have to rely on centralized platforms to store their personal data. This leaves them vulnerable to hacks and data breaches. With Web 3.0 and decentralized platforms, users can control their own data and decide who gets to access it. This creates a more secure and private internet for everyone.</li>
    <li><strong>The potential applications of Web 3.0 are endless.</strong> From decentralized social media to peer-to-peer marketplaces, the possibilities for Web 3.0 are limited only by our imagination. As more people adopt cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, we will see more companies and individuals experimenting with new ways to use it.</li>

   <h3>Practical Tips for Investing in Web 3.0</h3>

    <li>Consider investing in companies that are building on top of Ethereum. These companies have the potential to benefit greatly from the growth of Web 3.0.</li>
