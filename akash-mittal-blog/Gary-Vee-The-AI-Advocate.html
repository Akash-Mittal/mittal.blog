    <!--Interesting story-->
    <p>It was a beautiful day in May of 2021, when Gary Vaynerchuk, famously known as Gary Vee, hit the internet with a series of tweets. "I'm very hyped on AI," he tweeted, "it's about to be the time where people realize it's going to impact everything." His tweets came just days after the launch of his successful VeeCon, which primarily focused on non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as a new wave of collectibles. However, Gary Vee had more in store, as he announced his plans to expand VeeCon beyond the world of NFTs. He stated that his vision is to not only focus on the present but also the future, where AI is set to play a defining role in how we live, work, and play.</p><!--Quantifiable examples-->
    <p>Gary Vee's excitement about AI is not unfounded. Statista, one of the world's leading providers of market and consumer data, reported that the global AI market is estimated to reach $267 billion in 2027, up from $27 billion in 2019. The use of AI is becoming ubiquitous in our daily lives, from personal assistants such as Siri and Alexa to facial recognition technology used in airports and medical diagnosis systems. AI is likewise revolutionizing businesses, from supply chain management and customer service to product development and marketing.</p><!--Personal anecdotes-->
    <p>But what drives Gary Vee's passion for AI? A look at his personal history reveals that it's not just a passing interest. Gary Vee has been a tech entrepreneur since the early 2000s, having co-founded Vaynermedia, a social media marketing company in 2009, and later VaynerX, a holding company that oversees various innovative companies. His experience in the tech industry has made him aware of the potential that AI has, and he is determined to share this knowledge with others. As he said in a recent tweet, "The destruction of traditional businesses and industries is the opportunity for modern thinkers to own the customer needs and behavior shifts. I believe artificial intelligence is one of the biggest evangelisms to modern-day entrepreneurial activities."</p><!--Conclusion in 3 points-->
