    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Actress Amanda Seyfried has recently opened up about her struggles with OCD and anxiety, which started during her childhood and continue to impact her life as an adult. In a candid interview with Allure magazine, Seyfried revealed that her experience with these disorders has changed the way she parents her two children.</p>
    <p>According to Seyfried, her OCD manifests in obsessions and compulsions related to cleanliness and order. She has also struggled with anxiety, which she describes as a feeling of "imminent doom" that can be triggered by seemingly insignificant things.</p>
    <p>As a parent, Seyfried has had to balance her own mental health needs with the needs of her children, but she sees her struggles as an opportunity to model resilience and self-care.</p>

    <h2>Quantifiable examples</h2>
    <p>One specific way that Seyfried's OCD has affected her parenting is in the way she prepares food for her children. In the Allure interview, she described spending "twice as long" as a non-OCD parent would on tasks like washing vegetables or sterilizing bottles. While this may seem like a minor difference, it can add up to significant amounts of time that Seyfried is unable to spend with her kids.</p>
    <p>Seyfried has also had to learn to manage her anxiety when it comes to her children's safety. In a 2020 interview with People, she explained that her anxiety would sometimes make her reluctant to let her daughter play outdoors, even though she knew that fresh air and exercise were important for her child's well-being. To overcome this, she started practicing mindfulness and focusing on the present moment, rather than worrying about hypothetical worst-case scenarios.</p>

    <h2>Personal anecdotes</h2>
    <p>As someone who has lived with OCD and anxiety for most of her life, Seyfried has a deep understanding of the challenges that come with these disorders. In an interview with Health, she talked about how she copes with intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors, saying, "I've learned to embrace my anxiety instead of running away from it, and it's made me a better, braver person."</p>
    <p>She also talked about the importance of self-compassion and self-care, both for herself and for her children. In a 2019 interview with Parents, she said, "It's easy to feel like we're not doing enough, especially as moms. But it's important to take care of ourselves so we can take care of our children."</p>
