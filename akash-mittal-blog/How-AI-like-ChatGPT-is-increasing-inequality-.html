    <h2>The story of a job-seeking graduate and an AI recruiter</h2>
    <p>David had recently graduated from college and was looking for a job in his field of expertise. He was told by a friend to apply at a popular online job portal which was using an AI recruitment tool to shortlist candidates. David applied but never heard back. After a few weeks, he received a message from the same portal stating that his application was rejected due to lack of experience, even though he had relevant skills and qualifications.</p>
    <p>David discovered later that the recruitment tool used by the portal was programmed to filter out candidates with less than a certain number of years of experience, and his application did not even make it to a human recruiter. David's friend, who had recommended the job portal, also had a similar experience earlier. Both of them realized that the AI recruitment tool was contributing to inequality by favoring experienced candidates and rejecting those who had just graduated and had no prior work experience.</p>
