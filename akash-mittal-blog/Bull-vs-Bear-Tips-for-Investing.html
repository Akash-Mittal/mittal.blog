   <h2>How much of A.I. is just hype?</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>It was a typical Monday morning when Diane received a call from her friend, John, who had been investing in the stock market for years. John had always been a bull, believing that the market would continue to rise, but lately, he was having doubts.</p>
   <p>"What's going on?" Diane asked. "I thought you were riding high on the stock market."</p>
   <p>"I am," John replied. "But I keep hearing about all these new companies that are using A.I. and Robotics. It's important to stay ahead of the game, but is it all just hype?"</p>
   <p>Diane knew the importance of investing wisely, so she reached out to experts in the field: bulls and bears, who were both willing to share their tips on how to navigate the market with the growing impact of artificial intelligence.</p>
   <h3>The Bull: Betting on the Future</h3>
   <p>As a bull, Harold has always believed in the power of the market. "Investing in A.I. and robotics is like investing in the future," Harold explained. "These technologies are rapidly expanding and will provide great benefits to society, including increased efficiency and productivity."</p>
   <p>Harold's bullish investments paid off, with his portfolio posting strong returns for the past several years. "I'm very optimistic about the future of A.I. and robotics," Harold continued. "It's not just about investing in the technology companies themselves, but investing in those companies that will benefit from these technologies down the line."</p>
   <p>One example of a company that Harold sees great potential in is Amazon. "Amazon is at the forefront of A.I. and robotics, with their acquisition of Kiva Systems," Harold explained. "They have been able to cut their costs significantly, and I believe they will continue to do so as they expand their A.I. and robotics capabilities."</p>
   <h3>The Bear: Cautious Optimism</h3>
   <p>Unlike Harold, Maria is cautious when it comes to investing in A.I. and robotics. "While the potential benefits of these technologies are great, there are also many unknowns," Maria cautioned. "We need to carefully evaluate each investment to determine if it's worth the risk."</p>
   <p>Maria's strategy has been to invest in companies that are leaders in their respective industries. "There are many companies that will benefit from A.I. and robotics, but we need to be careful about which ones we invest in," Maria explained. "We want to invest in those companies that have a proven track record and are likely to withstand any potential market turbulence."</p>
   <p>One example of a company that Maria believes is worth investing in is IBM. "IBM has been around for a long time and has a strong history of innovation," Maria said. "They are well-positioned to take advantage of the rise of A.I. and robotics, and I believe they will continue to remain a leader in the industry."</p>
   <h3>Quantifiable Examples: The Rise of A.I. and Robotics</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Global spending on robotics and A.I. is expected to reach $230 billion by 2025</li>
    <li>Artificial intelligence is projected to add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030</li>
    <li>There were 1,073 artificial intelligence startups in the U.S. alone in 2019</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Conclusion</h3>
   <p>When it comes to investing in A.I. and robotics, there are two sides to the story: the bulls who see tremendous potential and the bears who are cautious about the unknown risks. Ultimately, it's up to each individual investor to determine which strategy is best for them.</p>
   <p>However, there are a few key takeaways that investors should keep in mind:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Do your research – Before investing in any company, make sure to thoroughly evaluate their track record and prospects for the future.</li>
    <li>Diversify your portfolio – Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across a variety of industries to minimize risk.</li>
    <li>Stay informed – Keep up with the latest trends and news in the market to make informed decisions about your investments.</li>
   </ol>
   <p>As technology continues to evolve and shape the market, investors must adapt and stay ahead of the curve.</p>
