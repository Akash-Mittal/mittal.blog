    <p>Imagine you're a sales representative trying to close a deal with a potential client. You've been following up with this client for weeks, but they keep putting you off. You're about to give up when you remember that you have a secret weapon: ChatGPT. You open up the app and type in the client's objections. Within seconds, ChatGPT provides you with a list of rebuttals that you can use to overcome their objections. Armed with this information, you go back to the client and close the deal on the spot. That's the power of ChatGPT.</p>
