   <p>Imagine waking up one day to find that your cryptocurrency wallet has been emptied overnight. That's exactly what happened to a friend of mine, who lost thousands of dollars due to a new type of malware that is targeting Mac users.</p>
   <p>This new infostealer malware is specifically designed to target crypto wallets, stealing sensitive information such as private keys, passwords, and wallet addresses. And it's not just targeting everyday users - even large companies are at risk. Just last month, Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, suffered a hack that resulted in a loss of 7000 bitcoins (worth over $40 million at the time).</p>

   <ol>

    <li>Regularly back up your wallet and keep it in a secure location, such as a USB drive or encrypted cloud storage.</li>
