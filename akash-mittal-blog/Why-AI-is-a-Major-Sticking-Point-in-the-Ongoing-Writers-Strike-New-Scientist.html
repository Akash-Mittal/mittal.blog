   <h2>The Story</h2>
   <p>Imagine spending hours and days writing a script for a TV show, and then finding out that your work is going to be "enhanced" by an artificial intelligence system. How would you feel? This is the reality for many writers in the entertainment industry, and it's causing a major uproar.</p>
   <p>The use of AI in entertainment is not a new trend, but its adoption is accelerating. As AI systems become more advanced and accessible, producers, studios, and streaming platforms are increasingly turning to AI to help create content. This includes everything from generating plot ideas to editing footage to optimizing marketing campaigns.</p>
   <p>However, the writers' guilds have raised concerns that the use of AI is undermining their craft and reducing their job opportunities. They argue that AI-generated content lacks the nuance, creativity, and human touch that distinguishes good writing from bad writing.</p>
   <h2>The Examples</h2>
   <p>Here are some quantifiable examples of how AI is being used in entertainment:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Netflix uses AI to suggest content to its subscribers</li>
    <li>Warner Bros. used an AI system to analyze the trailer of the movie "Morgan" and create a new trailer from scratch</li>
    <li>Botnik Studios used an AI system to generate a Harry Potter fanfiction called "Harry Potter and the Portrait of What Looked Like a Large Pile of Ash"</li>
   </ul>
   <p>While these examples may seem harmless, they are indicative of a larger trend that is affecting the way stories are told and consumed. As AI becomes more integrated into the entertainment industry, the role of writers is likely to change as well.</p>
   <h2>The Conclusions</h2>
   <p>Based on the above, we can draw the following conclusions:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>The use of AI in entertainment is a controversial issue that is dividing the industry</li>
    <li>The concerns of writers' guilds about the impact of AI on their craft and job prospects are valid</li>
    <li>The adoption of AI in entertainment is likely to have far-reaching consequences for the future of storytelling</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>The Tips</h2>
   <p>Here are some practical tips for writers who are concerned about the use of AI in entertainment:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Stay informed about the latest developments in AI and its impact on the entertainment industry</li>
    <li>Collaborate with AI systems and use them as tools, rather than enemies or competitors</li>
    <li>Create content that showcases your unique perspective, voice, and expertise, which cannot be replicated by AI systems</li>
   </ul>
