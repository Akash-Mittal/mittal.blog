  <p>Imagine you're working in a warehouse, trying to locate a specific item among thousands of others. You start walking down an aisle, but after a few steps, you realize you're lost. You don't know which way to turn or how many steps to take. It's frustrating, right? Now imagine you're a robot tasked with finding that same item. How do you think you would fare?</p>
  <p>Until recently, navigating complex environments was a major challenge for robots. But thanks to visual language maps, that's no longer the case. Visual language maps are essentially simplified diagrams that robots can use to understand their surroundings and navigate accordingly. They're based on the same principles as maps humans use, but they're designed specifically for robots.</p>
  <h2>Example</h2>
  <p>One example of visual language maps in action is in the hospitality industry. Hotel robots equipped with these maps can deliver items like towels and toiletries to guest rooms without getting lost or bumping into obstacles. At the Hilton McLean in Virginia, "Connie" the robot uses visual language maps to navigate the hotel and assist guests. She can even answer questions and make recommendations!</p>
  <p>Another use case is in the agricultural industry. Farmbots equipped&nbsp;with visual language maps can navigate fields and plant crops with precise accuracy. They can also avoid obstacles like rocks and irrigation systems, saving time and reducing the risk of damage to the crops.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>Visual language maps are enabling robots to navigate complex environments with greater accuracy and ease than ever before.</li>
   <li>From hotels to farms, visual language maps are finding applications in a wide range of industries.</li>
   <li>As technology continues to advance, we can expect to see even more innovative uses for visual language maps in the future.</li>
  </ol>
