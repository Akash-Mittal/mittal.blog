    <h3>The Importance of Self-Confidence</h3>
    <p>Self-confidence is a crucial trait to have in life. It allows us to believe in ourselves and our abilities, take risks, and handle challenges with grace and minimal stress. It's a quality that brings success, both professionally and personally.</p>
    <p>However, self-confidence isn't something that everyone is born with. It requires nurturing, encouragement, and practice. Parents can play a significant role in helping their children develop self-confidence, and it starts with these few tips:</p>
    <ol>
     <li><strong>Encourage Self-Expression:</strong> Children should feel free to express themselves without fear of judgment or repercussions from their parents. Encourage them to speak their minds, pursue their interests, and try new things, even if it means making mistakes along the way.</li>
     <li><strong>Provide Positive Feedback:</strong> Praising children for their effort, persistence, and accomplishments boosts their self-esteem and keeps them motivated. Parents should focus on their child's strengths and progress instead of their weaknesses and failures.</li>
     <li><strong>Lead by Example:</strong> Children learn a lot by observing their parents' behavior. Show them how to handle mistakes and setbacks, demonstrate self-respect and kindness, and model confident body language and communication skills.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Quantifiable Examples</h3>
    <p>Studies have shown that children who grow up with high self-confidence are more likely to:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Achieve academic success and become lifelong learners</li>
     <li>Develop strong relationships and social skills</li>
     <li>Take on leadership roles and succeed in their careers</li>
     <li>Experience lower levels of anxiety, depression, and stress</li>
     <li>Show resilience and adaptability in the face of challenges and change</li>
    </ul>
    <p>On the contrary, children with low self-confidence tend to:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Struggle academically and avoid challenges</li>
     <li>Experience social isolation and conflict</li>
     <li>Miss opportunities for growth and advancement</li>
     <li>Suffer from mental and emotional health issues</li>
     <li>Engage in risky and harmful behaviors to cope with their insecurities</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In Miko's case, her "Main Character Energy" is not just a sign of her confidence and charisma but also a testament to the positive influence her parents have on her upbringing.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>To sum up, self-confidence is a vital trait that parents should encourage in their children from an early age. By providing a nurturing and supportive environment, giving positive feedback, leading by example, and fostering self-expression, parents can help their children develop the confidence and resilience they need to succeed in life.</p>
    <p>With celebrities like Jeannie Mai promoting self-love and self-acceptance, we can hope to see more kids like Miko Mai expressing their "Main Character Energy" and inspiring others to do the same.</p>
    <p>Remember, self-confidence is a journey, not a destination, and it takes time, effort, and practice. The more we believe in ourselves, the more we can achieve.</p>
