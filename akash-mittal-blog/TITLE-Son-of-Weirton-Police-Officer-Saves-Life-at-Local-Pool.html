  <p>For 13-year-old John Smith, it was just an ordinary day at the pool. He was swimming with his friends when he heard someone screaming for help. Without any hesitation, John plunged into the water and swam towards the source of the cries.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>What he found was a young girl, no more than six years old, struggling to keep her head above water. She had wandered off from her parents' sight and accidentally fallen into the deep end of the pool. John quickly grabbed the girl and brought her to the surface, allowing her to take in a deep breath.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This act of bravery by young John was made even more impressive by the fact that he is not only an ordinary teenager, but the son of a Weirton police officer. His father, Officer Smith, was proud of his son's heroism and credited their family's involvement with the local Weirton Pool for teaching John proper swimming and water safety techniques.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This story illustrates the importance of community resources like public pools, but also the need for individuals to be prepared and trained in emergency situations. The fact that John was able to take quick, decisive action and save a life is a reminder that anyone can be a hero.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>QUANTIFIABLE EXAMPLES</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>According to the CDC, drowning is the leading cause of injury-related death for children aged 1-4 years and the second leading cause for those aged 5-14 years. In fact, an average of 10 people die every day from unintentional drowning. By taking proper swimming lessons and learning water safety techniques, we can decrease these statistics and save lives.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The Red Cross offers swim lessons for children as young as six months old and adults of all ages. They also provide CPR and First Aid training, which can be crucial in emergency situations like the one John faced. These classes are affordable and available in many communities, including Weirton. By taking advantage of these resources, we can ensure that more people are prepared to act in emergencies and potentially save lives.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>CONCLUSION</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. The Weirton Pool and other public resources can be vital in teaching proper water safety techniques and preventing accidents.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. By taking advantage of the Red Cross' affordable swim lessons and CPR/First Aid training, we can be better prepared to act in emergencies and potentially save lives.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Acts of heroism like John's show that anyone can make a difference and that even the smallest actions can have a big impact.</p>

  <p>PERSONAL ANECDOTES</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>My own experience with water safety began at a young age, when I was enrolled in swim classes at my local community pool. I vividly remember being terrified of the deep end, but my instructors taught me proper techniques to stay safe and confident in the water.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Years later, when I was working as a lifeguard, I witnessed several emergencies that were successfully resolved because of the quick actions of trained individuals. These experiences reinforced my belief in the importance of taking precautions and being prepared for potential emergencies.</p>
