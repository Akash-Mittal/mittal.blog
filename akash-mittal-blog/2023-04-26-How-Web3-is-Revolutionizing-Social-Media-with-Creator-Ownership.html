    <h2>An Interesting Story</h2>
    <p>Have you ever posted a picture, video, or written content on social media and later realized that it has been copied or plagiarized by someone else without your permission? This scenario is very common in today's centralized social media platforms, where creators have little control over their content and its distribution. But, what if there was a better way?</p>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>Concrete Examples</h2>
    <p>Web3, the decentralized web, is disrupting the traditional social media landscape by offering creators and users a more equitable and transparent way of interacting with each other. Platforms such as Hala, Minds, and BitClout are pioneering this movement by providing features like creator coin ownership, content monetization, and decentralized governance.</p>
    <p>For instance, Hala enables creators to mint their own tokens and distribute them to their followers as a form of social currency. These tokens can be used to gain exclusive access to content, events, or merchandise, and their value is determined by the creator's popularity and engagement. Similarly, Minds allows creators to earn tokens by sharing their content and engaging with their audience, which can be exchanged for goods or services on the platform or outside of it.</p>
    <p>Moreover, BitClout operates on a blockchain-based model, where users can buy and sell creator coins based on their reputation and community support. The more popular a creator is, the higher their coin price goes, and vice versa. This system encourages creators to make quality content and fosters a sense of ownership and loyalty among their followers.</p>
