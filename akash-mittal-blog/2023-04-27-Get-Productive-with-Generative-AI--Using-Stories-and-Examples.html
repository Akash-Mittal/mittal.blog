   <h2>How Generative AI Boosts Productivity and Retention</h2>
   <p>Imagine you are a manager at a consulting firm. Your team is facing a tight deadline to prepare a report for a client, and the workload is overwhelming. You notice that John, your most experienced analyst, seems to be struggling with the task. He has been making careless mistakes and falls behind on deadlines. You are concerned that he might burn out, and the quality of his work might suffer.</p>
   <p>You decide to try a new approach. You introduce a generative AI tool that can automate repetitive and tedious parts of the report. You teach John and the team how to use the tool, and provide some guidance on how to refine its suggestions. The result? John becomes more engaged and creative, and the team delivers the report ahead of schedule. The client is delighted with the quality, and your firm earns rave reviews.</p>
