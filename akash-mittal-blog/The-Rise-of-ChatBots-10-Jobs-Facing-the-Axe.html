    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The rise of ChatBots is changing the way we work and live. With technology advancing at such a rapid pace, it's important to consider what jobs may be at risk from automation and artificial intelligence. While ChatBots may be great for companies seeking to save costs and improve efficiency, it's important to remember that they are not a replacement for human interaction and empathy.</p>
    <ol>
     <li>ChatBots may automate routine tasks, but they cannot replace a human's emotional intelligence.</li>
     <li>As more jobs become automated, it's important for companies and governments to invest in retraining and education to help displaced workers.</li>
     <li>While some jobs may be at risk, the rise of ChatBots may also create new jobs in areas such as programming and maintenance.</li>
