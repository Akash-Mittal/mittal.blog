    <h2>The Rise of AI in the Stock Market</h2>
    <p>It was a gloomy day on Wall Street. The stocks were down, and the traders were grumpy. However, one particular investor was unfazed: Cathie Wood. She firmly believed that the future of stock market investing lies in the hands of artificial intelligence.</p>

    <h2>The Future of AI in the Stock Market</h2>
    <p>The future looks bright for AI in the stock market, and Cathie Wood's ARK Invest is at the forefront of this revolution. Here are three reasons why AI will continue to shape the stock market:</p>
