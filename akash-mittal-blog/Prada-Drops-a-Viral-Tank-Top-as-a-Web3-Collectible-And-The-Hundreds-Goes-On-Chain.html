    <p>On a summer day, a young man named Ethan walks into a Prada store, looking for a new outfit for an upcoming concert. He browsed through the store, but nothing seemed to catch his attention until he laid his eyes on a limited edition tank top. The design was unique, featuring Prada's signature triangular logo in a vibrant colorway. Ethan immediately loved it and decided to buy it, paying a hefty sum for a piece of clothing that he believed would make him stand out.</p>
    <p>Fast forward to a few weeks later, and Ethan is at the concert, wearing his Prada tank top. To his surprise, he notices several other people wearing the same shirt. At first, he felt disappointed, but then the realization hits him. He owned a one-of-a-kind piece, a collectible item that only a few were lucky enough to obtain.</p>
    <p>Prada recently made a move to bring collectibles to the blockchain, starting with a limited edition tank top. The company collaborated with Select, a company that specializes in Web3 collectibles, to create the digital version of the shirt, available as a non-fungible token (NFT). NFTs allow for an item to become verified on the blockchain, creating a sense of uniqueness and scarcity, making the item more valuable.</p>
    <p>Prada's move to incorporate collectibles on the blockchain is not new, as many other brands have done the same. However, it is a significant shift in the luxury fashion industry, which has been slow to embrace new technology. By creating a digital NFT of the tank top, Prada is allowing for its fans to enter the world of Web3 and take part in the emerging trend of blockchain collectibles.</p>
    <p>The Hundreds, a streetwear brand that has been around since 2003, is also jumping on the Web3 bandwagon. In a recent announcement, the brand stated that it would be launching a limited edition Web3 collection in collaboration with Rarible, a platform that allows creators to sell NFTs. The brand will release a collection of unique designs, including T-shirts, hoodies, and accessories, all available as NFTs.</p>
    <p>By creating collectible items available on the blockchain, brands like Prada and The Hundreds are creating a new market of consumers who value digital products as much as physical items. The pandemic has accelerated the shift towards digital products, from online shopping to virtual concerts, and now, blockchain collectibles. This shift towards Web3 is also a testament to the power of blockchain technology, which allows for items to become verifiable, unique, and valuable on a global scale.</p>
    
    <p>The move towards Web3 collectibles is not just a trend; it has already become a huge market. An example of this is the CryptoPunks, a series of 10,000 unique 8-bit characters that are verified on the Ethereum blockchain as an NFT. Initially sold for just a few dollars, CryptoPunks has now become a sought-after collectible, with some characters selling for millions of dollars. Recently, one of the rarest CryptoPunks sold for a record-breaking $69 million, making it the second most expensive artwork ever sold by a living artist.</p>
    <p>Another example of the power of Web3 collectibles is the NBA Top Shot, an online marketplace where users can buy, sell, and trade unique digital collectibles of NBA highlights as NFTs. Since its launch in October 2020, NBA Top Shot has generated over $720 million in sales, with some collectibles selling for thousands of dollars. The popularity of the platform is a clear indicator that there is a growing demand for unique and verifiable collectibles in the digital age.</p>
