  <main>
   <p>As a student of accounting, I remember how stressful it was to prepare for exams. Hours of studying and still feeling unsure about how I would perform. But what if I told you that there is now an AI-powered solution to make the process less daunting?</p>
   <p>Recently, OpenAI introduced a new AI language model called ChatGPT, which is capable of responding to human language in a human-like way. It can understand the context of a conversation and provide relevant responses.</p>
   <p>Now, some universities are using ChatGPT to conduct accounting exams. The students simply log in to a system and ask questions, just like they would in person. The AI then responds with relevant information, allowing the student to complete the exam without the need for a human invigilator.</p>
   <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
   <p>Some of the top universities in the United Kingdom, including the University of Manchester and the University of Edinburgh, have already started using ChatGPT for accounting exams. The results have been promising.</p>
   <p>One student, who wished to remain anonymous, said, "I was skeptical at first, but I found that the AI was able to provide me with the information I needed to answer the questions. It was like having a virtual tutor with me during the exam."</p>
   <h2>Key Players in the Industry</h2>
   <p>The main companies behind this technology are OpenAI and ProctorExam, a Dutch company that specializes in remote proctoring solutions. Both companies have collaborated to provide universities with an efficient and reliable way to conduct exams.</p>
   <p>OpenAI has been at the forefront of the AI revolution, and their ChatGPT technology has been well-received in many industries. ProctorExam, on the other hand, has been providing remote proctoring solutions for several years and has already established itself as a leader in the field.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>This new development is still in its infancy, and there are certainly some concerns about the use of AI in exams. However, if used correctly, AI-powered exams could be a game-changer for universities and students alike. Here are three critical comments:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>While ChatGPT has been successful in the UK, it remains to be seen how it will perform in other countries and with different languages.</li>
    <li>Some people may have concerns about privacy, as the AI would be monitoring the students during the exam.</li>
    <li>There is always the risk of cheating, although the AI would be able to detect any suspicious activity.</li>
   </ol>
