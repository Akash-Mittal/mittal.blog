    <p>In the summer of 2016, Pokémon Go was released and it quickly became a worldwide sensation. People of all ages were seen walking around their neighborhoods, parks, and city streets with their phones in hand, trying to catch virtual creatures called Pokémon. The game was revolutionary because it used augmented reality technology to blend virtual creatures into the real world.</p>
    <p>The success of Pokémon Go was not just limited to the gaming industry. Real-life businesses and landmarks, like restaurants and museums, saw an influx of customers who were playing the game. The game even had a positive impact on public health, with players getting more exercise and vitamin D from being outdoors.</p>
    <p>But Pokémon Go wasn't the first game to blend virtual and real-life experiences. In fact, there have been other games, like Ingress and Geocaching, that have been using similar technology for years. However, Pokémon Go was the first to truly capture mainstream attention and become a cultural phenomenon.</p>
    <p>One of the main companies behind Pokémon Go is Niantic, which spun off from Google in 2015. Niantic's CEO, John Hanke, had previously led the development of Google Earth and Google Maps, which helped with the development of Pokémon Go's location-based augmented reality technology.</p>
    <p>Another company that had a major role in the success of Pokémon Go is Nintendo, which owns the rights to the Pokémon franchise. Nintendo's stock price skyrocketed following the release of the game, but the company was criticized for not making enough revenue from the game, since most of the profits went to Niantic.</p>
    <p>Despite the initial hype, the popularity of Pokémon Go has since declined. However, the game has had a lasting impact on the gaming industry and has paved the way for other augmented reality games to be developed.</p>
