   <p>It was a beautiful sunny day and I was sitting in my office, browsing on my laptop. Suddenly, I received an email from my bank saying that they had detected unusual activity on my account and that I needed to take immediate action. Almost at the same time, my phone started ringing incessantly. It was my credit card company, also notifying me of suspicious charges. I had become a victim of cybercrime.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, I am not alone. Cybersecurity is becoming an increasingly pressing issue in our society. More and more companies, organizations, and individuals are falling prey to cyber attacks, and the consequences can be devastating: stolen identities, financial losses, reputational damage, and more.</p>
   <h2>The Numbers Speak for Themselves</h2>
   <p>If you think cyber attacks are a rare occurrence, think again. According to a study by the Ponemon Institute, the average cost of a data breach is $3.86 million. And it's not just big companies that are affected. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are also vulnerable to cybercrime, and often lack the proper resources to defend against it.</p>
   <p>Another study by Cybersecurity Ventures estimates that cybercrime will cost the world $6 trillion annually by 2021. That's a staggering amount of money, and a clear sign that cybersecurity is a major issue that needs to be addressed.</p>
   <h2>How Can We Protect Ourselves?</h2>
   <p>So, the question is: friend or foe? Cybersecurity can be both. On the one hand, it can protect us from malicious attacks and ensure the safety of our personal data. On the other hand, it can also limit our freedom and intrude on our privacy.</p>
   <p>But the good news is that there are steps we can take to protect ourselves. Here are three key strategies:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Stay Informed - Keep up to date with the latest threats and vulnerabilities. Attend cybersecurity events, read blogs and articles, and follow experts on social media. Being informed is the first step to staying safe.</li>
    <li>Use Strong Passwords - Weak passwords are one of the easiest ways for cyber criminals to gain access to our accounts. Make sure to use a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols, and avoid common phrases and dictionary words.</li>
    <li>Install Antivirus Software - Antivirus software can help identify and remove malware from your computer or device. Make sure to keep it up to date to ensure you have the latest protection.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>Cybersecurity is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires constant attention. While it can be a friend that protects us from harm, it can also be a foe that threatens our privacy and security. However, by staying informed, using strong passwords, and installing antivirus software, we can take steps to protect ourselves and minimize the risks.</p>
