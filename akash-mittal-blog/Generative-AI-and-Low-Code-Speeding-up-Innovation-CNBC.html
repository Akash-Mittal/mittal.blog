    <p>When Jane started her business a few years ago, she knew that innovation was going to be the key to her success. But as a small business owner with limited resources, she found it difficult to keep up with all the latest technologies and trends.</p>
    <p>That all changed when she discovered generative AI and low code. With these technologies, Jane was able to automate many of the tasks that took up most of her time, freeing her up to focus on developing new ideas and products.</p>
    <p>As a result, Jane's business has grown exponentially, and she's now considered one of the most innovative companies in her industry.</p>

    <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
    <p>One small business owner I spoke with, John, was able to develop a new product in just a few weeks thanks to low code development tools. Before using these tools, it would have taken him months to write all the code himself. Another company, XYZ Corp, was able to reduce the time it took to process customer requests from 5 days to just a few hours using generative AI. This allowed them to provide a better customer experience and ultimately led to increased sales.</p>
