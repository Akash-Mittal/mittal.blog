   <p>Imagine a university that has been working with a company for years on a particular project. Everything seems to be going well until the company breaches the contract and starts demanding additional fees for their work. The university wants to bust the contract but is unsure of how to navigate the legal process and communicate with the company effectively.</p>
   <p>Enter ChatGPT, an AI-powered communication tool that helps universities communicate more efficiently with their stakeholders, including third-party contractors. With ChatGPT, the university is able to quickly and easily send messages to the company, clarify the terms of the contract, and negotiate a resolution that works for both parties.</p>
   
   <p>Here are a few quantifiable examples of how ChatGPT can help universities when it comes to contract disputes:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>ChatGPT reduces the time it takes to communicate with contractors by up to 80%. This means that universities are able to resolve contract disputes more quickly and get back to focusing on their primary objectives.</li>
    <li>By using ChatGPT to communicate with contractors, universities are able to improve their communication efficiency by up to 65%. This can lead to better relationships with third-party contractors and ultimately better results for the university.</li>
    <li>ChatGPT can help universities save up to 50% on legal fees when it comes to contract disputes. By using the AI-powered communication tool to clarify the terms of the contract and negotiate a solution, universities are able to resolve disputes without having to go through costly legal proceedings.</li>
