  <p>Farrah Abraham, a former star of the MTV reality series Teen Mom, is under fire yet again from fans and critics who are calling her out for an inappropriate parenting decision with her daughter. The controversial reality star, who is a single mother to 12-year-old Sophia, recently shared a video on social media that has sparked outrage amongst viewers.</p>
  <h2>The Controversy</h2>
  <p>In the video, which was posted to Instagram, Abraham can be seen encouraging her daughter to dance provocatively in a tight-fitting outfit. Sophia can be seen gyrating and shaking her hips in a suggestive manner, which many fans and critics have deemed inappropriate and age-inappropriate.</p>
  <p>The video has since gone viral and has sparked a heated debate among viewers. Many have condemned Abraham for her parenting choices, arguing that she is sexualizing her child and setting a bad example for young girls everywhere.</p>

Similarly, a study by the American Psychological Association found that children who are exposed to sexualized messages in the media are more likely to engage in risky sexual behaviors and develop unhealthy attitudes and beliefs about sex.</p>
  <p>These findings highlight the potential long-term impact that Abraham's parenting choices could have on her daughter's wellbeing and development.</p>
