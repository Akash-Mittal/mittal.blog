    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>It was a Monday morning when Mumbai-based software engineer, Manish, opened his laptop to start working from home. Flicking through his emails, he noticed something strange. A few emails from his clients, which appeared to be genuine, were carrying attachments that seemed suspicious. Sensing danger, he decided to give the emails a miss.</p>
    <p>What Manish didn't know was that he had just thwarted a major cyber attack on his clients' data. The suspicious attachments hidden in those emails were malware-laden. Had he opened them, he would have allowed hackers to compromise confidential data belonging to his clients, subsequently causing serious financial damage.</p>
    <p>The frequency of cyber attacks in India has become alarmingly high. Lately, the nation has seen a significant increase in the sophistication of such attacks. In an effort to tackle this growing threat, the Defence Cyber Agency (DCA) recently conducted a week long exercise aimed at fortifying India's digital infrastructure.</p>
    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>The DCA, an agency under the Ministry of Defence, was set up in 2019 to bolster the country's defence against cyber warfare. The week-long drill, named 'Cyberex', was conducted in partnership with all 12 Integrated Defence Staff (IDS) commands and other government agencies.</p>
    <p>The objective of Cyberex was to demonstrate the coordination and ability of the DCA to manage cyber threats during times of crisis. Exercises included red teaming, blue teaming, network penetration testing, web application testing and malware analysis.</p>
    <p>The exercise involved more than 125 personnel from various defence services. The participants were distributed across four teams - red team, blue team, threat intelligence team and communication and logistics team.</p>
    <h2>The Results</h2>
    <p>Cyberex was instrumental in identifying gaps in India's cyber security infrastructure and demonstrated the coordination between various defence services in dealing with cyber threats. The exercise also served as a training ground for cyber warriors to hone their skills.</p>
    <p>The results from Cyberex were quantifiable and impressive. The exercise led to an improvement in the industry's cyber security digital architecture and a decrease in the number of successful attacks. It further highlighted the importance of institutionalising collaboration between all relevant departments to effectively combat cyber attacks.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The cyber threat landscape is constantly evolving and India's defence against it needs to adapt accordingly. Cyberex was a successful exercise demonstrating how India's defence forces can work together to overcome cyber threats during times of crisis. The exercise has helped the country in strengthening its cyber security infrastructure and equipping cyber warriors with the training they need to combat these threats.</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Collaboration between relevant departments is crucial to effectively combat cyber attacks.</li>
     <li>Regular training exercises like Cyberex are necessary to identify gaps in the cyber security infrastructure.</li>
     <li>Improvements to India's cyber security infrastructure need to continue to protect against new threats.</li>
    </ol>
