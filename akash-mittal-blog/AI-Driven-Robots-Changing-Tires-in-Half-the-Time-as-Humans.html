    <p>John was a tire changer at a local mechanic shop for 15 years. He was an experienced and skilled technician who could change a tire in less than 30 minutes. However, he was about to be replaced by a robot.</p>
    <p>The owner of the shop had invested in AI technology and purchased a tire-changing robot. The robot was programmed to change a tire in just 15 minutes, half the time it took John to complete the task.</p>
    <p>John was shocked and upset. He felt that he had lost his job to a machine that couldn't possibly do as good a job as he could. However, he soon realized that the robot was not a threat but an opportunity.</p>
    
    <p>The use of AI-driven robots in the automotive industry is on the rise. According to a report by the International Federation of Robotics, the number of robots used in the automotive industry increased by 43% between 2013 and 2017.</p>
    <p>Not only do robots change tires faster, but they also have other benefits. For example, they can work 24/7 without taking breaks or getting tired, which increases productivity. They also improve safety by reducing the risk of accidents and injuries.</p>
    <p>Another example is the Tesla factory, where robots do most of the work. Tesla uses more than 10,000 robots to produce its electric vehicles, which has helped the company to increase production and reduce costs.</p>
    <h2>Eye-catching Title</h2>
    <p>The title of this article is intended to grab the attention of the reader and provoke interest in the topic. It highlights the fact that AI-driven robots can change tires in half the time as humans, which is a significant improvement in efficiency and productivity. It also suggests that this technology is already being used in the US and could be adopted in other countries as well.</p>
    <h2></h2>
    <ul>
     <li>AI-driven robots are changing the automotive industry by improving productivity and safety.</li>
     <li>Robots can perform tasks faster and more consistently than humans, which increases efficiency and reduces costs.</li>
     <li>The adoption of AI technology in the automotive industry is on the rise, and it has the potential to revolutionize the way vehicles are produced and serviced.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
    <p>One example of how AI-driven robots are changing the industry is the case of a tire manufacturer in China. The company installed a robotic system that can produce a tire in just 52 seconds, which is three times faster than a human worker.</p>
    <p>Another example is the use of robots in car painting. Robots can apply paint more precisely and consistently than humans, which ensures a perfect finish every time.</p>
    <p>As for the impact on human workers, some experts argue that the adoption of AI technology will create new job opportunities. For example, people will be needed to operate and maintain the robots, as well as to develop new AI software.</p>
