    <p>It all started with a TikTok video. In 2020, a group of young entrepreneurs decided to create an AI chatbot that could interact with users on social media platforms. They named it Tako, after the Japanese word for octopus, as it was intended to have multiple tentacles in different social media channels.</p>
    <p>Tako quickly gained popularity, as it was not just able to answer simple questions, but also had the ability to hold conversations and understand the context of the message. The team behind Tako worked tirelessly to improve its AI technology, making it more human-like with every update.</p>

Its retention rate is over 80%, which means that most users come back to use Tako again.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, Tako's AI technology has been recognized by several industry experts, winning awards such as the Best Chatbot App at the 2021 Webby Awards.
