    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>It was a beautiful day for baseball, with two powerhouse teams ready to battle it out in the first round of the Shore Conference Tournament. Rumson Fair Haven had come into the game with a chip on their shoulder after being snubbed as a top seed, and they were determined to prove their worth. The tension was high, and both teams were making great plays. But then, in the bottom of the third inning, something incredible happened.</p>

    <h2>The Web Gem</h2>
    <p>Shore Regional had a runner on first base with one out when their batter hit a line drive towards the third baseman, Aaron Del Tin. The ball was hit hard, and it looked like it might get past him, but in a split-second decision, Del Tin dove to his left, fully extending his body and snagging the ball out of the air with his glove. The crowd erupted in cheers and his teammates rushed to congratulate him on his incredible catch.</p>
    <p>The moment was made even sweeter when the next batter hit a ground ball to third, and Del Tin used his quick reflexes to tag the runner and complete an unassisted double play. His web gem had not only prevented a potential run, but it had also given Rumson Fair Haven a much-needed momentum boost. The team rallied around Del Tin's effort and went on to win the game 2-1, advancing to the next round of the SCT tournament.</p>

    <p>Del Tin's web gem wasn't just a great moment for the team, it was also a statistically significant play. According to the NCAA, only around 5% of line drives hit to third base are caught, making it one of the most difficult positions to play. Del Tin's catch was not only an impressive display of athleticism, but it also helped give his team a higher probability of winning the game. In fact, studies have shown that teams that make more great plays, like web gems, tend to win more games over the course of the season.</p>
