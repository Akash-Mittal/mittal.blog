    <p>Co-parenting can be a challenging task, especially when the parents are no longer in a relationship. Gavin Rossdale, the ex-husband of Gwen Stefani, recently opened up about the hardest part of co-parenting his three sons with her. In an interview with People magazine, he revealed the struggle of being away from his sons when they are with their mother.</p>
    <p>Rossdale said, "I think just the distance. You know, when you have kids, and you're not with that person, then you have to figure out the schedule. I took the boys to school this morning, but when they're with their mom, obviously I don't do that, so that's a bit hard."</p>
    <p>The couple got divorced in 2015 after 13 years of marriage and share joint custody of their three sons - Kingston, 14, Zuma, 12, and Apollo, 7. Despite their separation, they have maintained a cordial relationship for the sake of their children.</p>
