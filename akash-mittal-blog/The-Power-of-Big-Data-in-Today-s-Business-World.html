    <p>Imagine you are walking down the street and suddenly you see a billboard with an advertisement for a new car model. You haven't thought about buying a new car, but you stop and take a closer look. This is not a coincidence, but the result of big data analytics.</p>
    <p>The large amounts of data produced by individuals and companies every day are changing the way business is done. Big data analysis can provide insights into consumer behaviour, trends, and preferences that were previously impossible to obtain. Companies can use these insights to improve their products, marketing, and performance.</p>
    <p>One company that has been successful in harnessing the power of big data is Amazon. The e-commerce giant uses data analytics to analyse customer behaviour on its platform, predicting what customers are likely to buy next, and recommending products accordingly. This has resulted in higher sales and increased customer satisfaction.</p>
    <p>Another example is Netflix, which uses data analysis to recommend movies and TV shows to its users. The company tracks user behaviour to suggest content that they are likely to enjoy, resulting in increased engagement and retention.</p>
    <p>But it's not just tech companies that can benefit from big data. The sports industry is also utilising data analytics to improve player performance and team strategy. NBA teams are using data to analyse player movements and shot patterns to make more informed decisions.</p>
