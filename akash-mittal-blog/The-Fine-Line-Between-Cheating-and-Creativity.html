   <p>As a high school student, John always struggled to come up with original ideas for his assignments. He would often find himself copying content from the internet and presenting it as his own. He would never think of it as cheating, but rather as a creative way of completing his work.</p>
   <p>John is not alone in this. Many students around the world are often caught between the fine line of cheating and creativity. The question is, where do we draw the line?</p>
   <h2>Creative Work vs Plagiarism</h2>
   <p>As technology advances, it has become easier for students to copy and paste information from the internet. While this may seem like a creative hack to completing assignments, it is actually considered plagiarism. Plagiarism is defined as the act of taking someone else's work and using it as your own without giving proper credit.</p>
   <p>There are several ways to determine if a piece of work is considered plagiarism. For example, if a student has copied more than two sentences in a row from a source without giving proper credit, it is considered plagiarism. Students who present a piece of work that has been submitted by someone else who has already completed the same assignment, are also accused of plagiarism.</p>
   <h3>Quantifiable examples</h3>
   <p>A study by the International Center of Academic Integrity revealed that nearly 80% of college students admitted to cheating at some point during their academic career. Out of those students, 96% admitted to cheating through the use of technology, like copying and pasting material from the internet.</p>
   <p>In another study, conducted by the Public Library of Science, it was found that plagiarism had significantly increased among students since the 1980s. Researchers believe that the rise in technology has made it easier for students to plagiarize work.</p>
   <h2>Benefits of Creativity</h2>
   <p>While plagiarism may seem like an easy way out, it does not offer any benefits to students. Creativity, on the other hand, offers several benefits. When students are tasked with coming up with original ideas, they are forced to think outside the box. This helps to strengthen their critical thinking and problem-solving skills.</p>
   <p>Creativity also helps to improve student engagement and promotes a sense of accomplishment. When students are given the freedom to express themselves creatively, they feel more invested in the task at hand. They are more likely to put in the effort to produce high-quality work.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, the fine line between cheating and creativity is one that should be constantly addressed. Plagiarism offers no benefits to students and can lead to serious consequences. It is important for educators to foster an environment that promotes creativity and originality.</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Students should be taught the consequences of plagiarism from an early age.</li>
    <li>Teachers should provide students with clear guidelines on what is considered cheating and what is considered creativity.</li>
    <li>Parents should encourage their children to think outside the box and to come up with original ideas for their assignments.</li>
   </ol>
   <p>By promoting creativity, we are not only helping students to learn and grow, but we are also giving them the tools they need to succeed in life.</p>
