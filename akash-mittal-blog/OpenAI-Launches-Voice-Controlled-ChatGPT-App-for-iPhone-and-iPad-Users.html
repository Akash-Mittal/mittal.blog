    <h3> or Case Studies</h3>
    <p>One of the interesting aspects of the ChatGPT app is its ability to learn from its users. As you use the app, it gets better at understanding your commands and can even anticipate your needs based on your past behavior. For instance, if you regularly ask the app to play music by a particular artist, it will learn to suggest songs by that artist when you ask for music.</p>

With the voice-controlled feature, they can perform tasks without having to hold or tap on their devices, which can be a game-changer for those who struggle with mobility.</p>
