  <h1>Bad Parenting: Is Gen X Outdoing Boomers?</h1> <img src="images/Bad-Parenting-Is-Gen-X-Outdoing-Boomers.jpeg" alt="+Bad-Parenting-Is-Gen-X-Outdoing-Boomers+">
  <p></p>
  <p>It was a typical Sunday afternoon, and Amy and her two-year old son, Jack, were out shopping. Jack suddenly started crying, as toddlers often do, and Amy couldn't help but feel embarrassed. That's when an elderly woman approached her.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>"Back in my day, we didn't take our children to fancy stores," the woman said as she gave Amy a disapproving look. "You millennials are raising a bunch of spoiled brats."</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Amy couldn't help but feel insulted. She's not a millennial - she's a Gen Xer, and she's doing her best to raise her son in a world that's vastly different from the one she grew up in. And, as it turns out, she's not alone.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>A recent survey by the Pew Research Center found that Gen Xers are more likely than Boomers to believe that parenting has become harder over the past few decades. And while many Boomers might argue that Gen Xers are overprotective, coddling parents, the truth is that both generations have their fair share of bad apples.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>So, who's really winning the bad parenting race? Let's take a look at some quantifiable examples.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Example #1: Helicopter Parenting</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Helicopter parenting, also known as overparenting, is a term that's often used to describe Gen X parents. These are the parents who constantly hover over their children, making sure they're safe and happy at all times. But are Boomers any better?</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>According to a study by the University of Mary Washington, helicopter parenting has been on the rise since the 1980s - which means that both Gen Xers and Boomers are guilty of it. In fact, the study found that Boomers are more likely than Gen Xers to believe that their children are special and deserve special treatment.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Example #2: Screen Time</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another parenting issue that often comes up is screen time. It's no secret that children today spend a lot of time in front of screens - whether it's a TV, a tablet, or a smartphone. But who's to blame?</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>According to a survey by Common Sense Media, Boomers are just as likely as Gen Xers to allow their children to have unlimited access to screens. In fact, the survey found that only 17% of Boomers said they limit their children's screen time, compared to 22% of Gen Xers.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Example #3: Work-Life Balance</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Finally, let's talk about work-life balance. Both Gen Xers and Boomers are working longer hours than ever before, but are they taking the time they need to spend with their families?</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>According to a study by the Families and Work Institute, Gen Xers are more likely than Boomers to say that work interferes with their family time. In fact, the study found that 43% of Gen Xers said they don't have enough time to spend with their families, compared to 38% of Boomers.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>So, who's winning the bad parenting race? The truth is, both generations have their flaws. But, as Amy would tell you, it's important to remember that parenting is hard work - and we can all learn from each other's mistakes.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Here are three things to keep in mind:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Don't be a helicopter parent. Give your children room to explore and make mistakes.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Limit screen time. Children need to be active and engage with the world around them.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Make time for your family. Work is important, but so is spending time with the people you love.</p>
