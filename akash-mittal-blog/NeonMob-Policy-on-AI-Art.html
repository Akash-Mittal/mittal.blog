   <h1>The Rise of AI Art and NeonMob's Policy on AI-generated Images</h1> <img src="images/NeonMob-Policy-on-AI-Art.jpeg" alt="+NeonMob-Policy-on-AI-Art+">
   <p>Artificial intelligence is no longer just the stuff of sci-fi movies and tech labs. It has become a tool that is increasingly being used to create art. As the use of AI-generated images continues to grow, it is important that we examine its impact on the art world. In this article, we will explore the rise of AI art and NeonMob's policy on AI-generated images.</p>

    <h2>The Rise of AI Art</h2>
    <p>The use of artificial intelligence in creating art has been on the rise in recent years. Artists are using machine learning algorithms to create paintings, music, and more. In some cases, these works are indistinguishable from those created by humans. One example is the painting "Portrait of Edmond de Belamy" created by the Paris-based art collective Obvious using a machine learning algorithm.</p>
    <p>AI-generated images have sparked debate in the art world. Some argue that it is simply a tool that can be used to create new forms of art. Others worry that AI-generated images undermine the authenticity of art and devalue the role of the artist.</p>

    <h2>NeonMob's Policy on AI-generated Images</h2>
    <p>NeonMob, a platform for buying, collecting, and trading digital art, has a policy on AI-generated images. According to their website, they do not allow images that were created primarily through the use of a machine learning algorithm. They do, however, allow images that were created using AI as a tool in conjunction with the artist's creative input.</p>
    <p>This policy is in line with the concerns that some in the art world have about AI-generated images. By requiring that artists have creative control, NeonMob is ensuring that AI-generated images are not seen as a replacement for human creativity.</p>

    <p>The impact of AI-generated images on the art world can be seen in the numbers. One study found that AI-generated art was sold for a total of $1.3 million in 2019. This was a significant increase from the $16,000 in sales in 2016. Another study found that 25% of all AI-generated art is created by just three artists.</p>
    <p>These examples demonstrate the growth and potential of AI-generated art. As technology continues to develop, it is likely that we will see even more artists using AI to create new forms of art.</p>
