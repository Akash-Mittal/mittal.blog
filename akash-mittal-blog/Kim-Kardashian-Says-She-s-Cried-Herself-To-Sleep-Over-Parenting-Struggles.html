  <p>Kim Kardashian is one of the world's most famous celebrities, with millions of fans around the globe. From her reality TV show to her fashion and beauty lines, she seems to have it all. However, in a recent interview, she opened up about the challenges of parenting and how it has affected her emotionally.</p>
  <p>Kim, who is a mother of four children, revealed that there have been times when she has cried herself to sleep because of the difficulties of being a parent. She said that she finds it hard to balance her busy career with the responsibilities of raising children, and that it can be overwhelming at times.</p>
  <p>"It's not easy," she said. "There are days when I feel like I'm failing as a parent and that I'm not doing enough. I just wish there were more hours in the day."</p>

   <li>The same survey found that 41% of working mothers say that being a parent has made it harder for them to advance in their career.</li>
   <li>A study by the American Psychological Association found that parents who are stressed out are more likely to engage in negative parenting behaviors, such as yelling or spanking their children.</li>
  </ul>
