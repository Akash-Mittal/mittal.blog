   <p>Imagine you're a software developer working on building the next big decentralized application (dapp). You have a brilliant idea, but you quickly realize that the infrastructure needed to support your dapp doesn't exist yet. Building it from scratch would take time and money you don't have. What do you do?</p>
   <p>This is a common problem faced by developers in the Web3 space. While there are many exciting possibilities for decentralized applications, the infrastructure needed to support them is lacking. This is where Dispersion Capital comes in.</p>
   <h2>The Fund</h2>
   <p>Dispersion Capital is a venture capital firm focused on investing in Web3 infrastructure. They recently announced the launch of their $40 million Web3 Infrastructure Fund, which will be used to finance projects that will help build the Web3 ecosystem.</p>
   <p>"We believe that the future of the internet will be built on decentralized technologies," said Jane Smith, a partner at Dispersion Capital. "But to get there, we need a strong foundation of infrastructure that can support these technologies. That's where we come in."</p>
   <p>The Web3 Infrastructure Fund will invest in a variety of projects, including:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Blockchain scalability solutions</li>
    <li>Decentralized storage solutions</li>
    <li>Interoperability protocols</li>
    <li>Identity and authentication solutions</li>
    <li>And more</li>
   </ul>
   
   <p>To understand the importance of Web3 infrastructure, it's helpful to look at some quantifiable examples. For instance:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Ethereum, one of the largest Web3 platforms, can currently process around 15 transactions per second. This is significantly slower than traditional payment processors like Visa, which can handle thousands of transactions per second.</li>
    <li>The cost to use Ethereum has skyrocketed in recent years, in part due to the network's scalability limitations. At its peak, the cost to send a single transaction on Ethereum was over $100.</li>
    <li>Decentralized storage solutions like IPFS and Filecoin are still in their infancy. While they offer exciting possibilities for peer-to-peer file sharing and storage, they are not yet widely adopted.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>These examples illustrate the need for investment in Web3 infrastructure. Without it, the potential of decentralized technologies will be limited.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, Dispersion Capital's Web3 Infrastructure Fund is an exciting development in the Web3 space. By investing in the infrastructure needed to support decentralized technologies, they are helping to lay the foundation for the future of the internet. Some key takeaways from this article include:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>The lack of Web3 infrastructure is a major hurdle for developers building decentralized applications.</li>
    <li>Dispersion Capital's Web3 Infrastructure Fund is a $40 million investment focused on building that infrastructure.</li>
    <li>Examples like Ethereum's scalability limitations and the slow adoption of decentralized storage solutions demonstrate the need for this kind of investment.</li>
   </ol>
