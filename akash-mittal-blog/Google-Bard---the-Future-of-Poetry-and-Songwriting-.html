  <h1> Google Bard �?? the Future of Poetry and Songwriting?</h1> <img src="./images/Google-Bard---the-Future-of-Poetry-and-Songwriting-.jpeg" alt="+ Google Bard �?? the Future of Poetry and Songwriting?+">
  <p></p>
  <p>Once upon a time, in the musical world, catchy lyrics and memorable melodies came from the minds of highly creative singers and songwriters. But now, with the advent of Google's latest technology innovation, the art of poetry and songwriting may never be the same again.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Google recently announced the launch of the beta version of �??Bard�??, an AI-powered tool that can assist songwriters in crafting their lyrics and help them create a melody. Bard uses machine learning algorithms to understand the meaning and emotions behind the given words and tunes, and then synthesizes them into a beautiful, harmonious composition. As Google claims, Bard is �??a creative partner that can inspire you and help express your ideas in a unique way�??.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>But, will this new tool replace the creative minds of human songwriters or merely add more value to their work?</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Real-life examples show that AI tools like Bard are already being used by various music companies to create new compositions. For instance, in 2016, Amper Music, an AI-based music composition platform, generated a complete album by analyzing and processing data from various music genres and artists. Similarly, in 2017, AIVA (Artificial Intelligence Virtual Artist) produced a beautiful composition called �??Genesis�?? that was performed live by the Brussels Philharmonic Orchestra.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>As more and more music companies embrace AI in the creative process, it�??s possible that we may see a gradual shift from human-powered to AI-generated compositions in the future.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>However, it's worth noting that while AI can create melodies, it still lacks creativity and originality when it comes to generating lyrics that connect with human emotions at a deeper level. Thus, human songwriters can still offer a unique perspective that AI tools like Bard may not be able to replicate.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>As for the companies in this field, Amper and AIVA have already made a name for themselves in the market. However, with Google�??s Bard gaining popularity, it could be a significant addition to the music industry.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, while Bard and other AI-powered tools can undoubtedly help songwriters, the future of music will be a collaboration between human creativity and AI generated melodies. It is indeed exciting to think about the endless possibilities of such partnerships that can bring a new wave of music to the industry.</p>
