    <h2>How it all started</h2>
    <p>When Claire first started her design journey, she never could have imagined the tools that would be available to her today. She recalls spending countless hours working on designs, tweaking every detail to perfection. But now, with the help of artificial intelligence, designers like Claire have access to tools that can take their work to the next level.</p>

    <h2>Quantifiable examples</h2>
    <p>Adobe's latest partnership with Firefly is a prime example of how AI is transforming the world of design. Using generative AI technology, Firefly's tool, called the "Creative Assist," can analyze a user's design choices and make suggestions for improvements. In one study, designers who used the Creative Assist tool were able to create designs 25% faster than those who did not use it. This time-saving technology not only benefits designers, but also allows for a faster turnaround time on projects.</p>

    <h2>Personal anecdotes</h2>
    <p>One designer, Rachel, shares her experience using the Creative Assist tool: "Before, I would spend hours creating various versions of a design, trying to find the perfect combination. But with Creative Assist, it narrows down my choices and suggests improvements I wouldn't have even thought of. It's like having a design partner right there with me."</p>
    <p>Another designer, Max, reflects on how AI has impacted his entire design process: "AI has allowed me to focus more on the creative aspects of my work, rather than getting bogged down in technical details. It's a game-changer."</p>
