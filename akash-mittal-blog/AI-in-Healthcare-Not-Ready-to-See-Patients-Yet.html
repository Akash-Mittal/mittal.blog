    <p>Imagine walking into a doctor's office only to be greeted by an AI-powered machine. You may think it's a scene out of a sci-fi movie, but the reality is that AI is making its way into healthcare. However, despite the hype, AI is not yet ready to see patients.</p>

    <p>While AI has shown promise in diagnosing diseases and predicting outcomes, there are still limitations. In a study published in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>, an AI algorithm was able to accurately diagnose skin cancer with a sensitivity of 95%, which was comparable to dermatologists. However, the algorithm was trained with a limited dataset, which may not reflect the real-world diversity of cases. Furthermore, the algorithm did not consider the patients' history or previous skin biopsies, which are crucial factors in making a diagnosis. Another study found that an AI model could predict heart disease with a higher accuracy than traditional risk factors, but this does not necessarily translate into clinical practice.</p>

    <p>Kara, a mother of two, was worried about her youngest daughter's recurrent ear infections. She researched online and found an AI-powered telemedicine service that claimed to diagnose and treat minor illnesses from the comfort of her home. Kara signed up and was immediately connected to a chatbot. After answering a series of questions, the chatbot diagnosed her daughter with a viral infection and prescribed some over-the-counter medications. Kara followed the instructions, but her daughter's symptoms persisted, and she became more concerned. She decided to take her daughter to a pediatrician, who diagnosed her with a bacterial infection and prescribed antibiotics. Kara realized that although AI had the potential to provide convenience, it could not replace the expertise of a trained healthcare provider.</p>
