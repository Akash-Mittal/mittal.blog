   <p>Imagine buying a rare piece of art, such as the Mona Lisa, and being the only person in the world to own it. This is the concept of non-fungible tokens or NFTs. Romania is now taking a step forward towards Web3 by launching its own national NFT marketplace.</p>
   <p>The National Research and Development Institute for Optoelectronics, INOE 2000, in Romania has partnered with BLOKO, a blockchain platform, to launch this new marketplace. The platform aims to bring Romanian artwork, collectibles, and other unique items to the mainstream.</p>
   <p>The marketplace will promote Romanian art and culture and allow artists to showcase their talents on a global platform. It also enables buyers to purchase unique artwork, such as sculptures or digital prints, with just a few clicks.</p>
   <h2>Concrete Examples</h2>
   <p>Examples of NFTs being sold for millions of dollars are not unheard of. For instance, NFT digital artwork "Everydays: The First 5000 Days" by Beeple was sold for a mind-boggling $69 million at Christie's auction house in March 2021.</p>
   <p>The National Museum of Romanian Literature (MNLR) has also digitized rare manuscripts of famous Romanian writers such as George Bacovia, Mihai Eminescu, and Ion Creanga. These manuscripts will be up for sale on the NFT marketplace, making them accessible to a wider audience.</p>
