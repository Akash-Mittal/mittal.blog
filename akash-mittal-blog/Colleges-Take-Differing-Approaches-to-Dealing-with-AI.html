   <p>Once upon a time, a group of college officials were gathered together to discuss the use of AI in their respective institutions. Each one had a different perspective on how to approach the topic.</p>
   <p>One college believed in incorporating AI into their curriculum to prepare students for the future job market. They partnered with Microsoft to provide students access to Azure Machine Learning Studio.</p>
   <p>Another college was concerned about the ethical implications of AI and decided to hire an AI Ethics specialist to guide the institution in making responsible decisions when implementing AI technology.</p>
   <p>Yet another college was skeptical about the capabilities of AI and believed in keeping their traditional teaching methods. They refused to incorporate any form of AI into their curriculum.</p>
   <p>Real-life examples of how colleges approach AI can be seen in companies such as Microsoft, who has been working with various colleges to provide access to their AI technology. Another example is the University of New South Wales who has made AI ethics and responsible AI their top priorities in their 5-year strategic plan.</p>
   <p>It is important for colleges to take a stance on AI as it is increasingly becoming a part of our daily lives. The approach that each college takes will have a significant impact on how their students learn and how they will be prepared for the future job market.</p>
