  <p>If you’re a student, parent, or teacher in El Dorado, Arkansas, you may have experienced the frustration of internet and phone line outages recently. El Dorado School District is comprised of three schools, and all of them have been struggling with unreliable internet and phone services for several days now.</p><!--Story-->
  <p>The issue started when the recent storm knocked down power lines that provide connectivity to these schools. Despite the efforts of the school administration and internet/phone service providers, the issue has not been fully resolved yet. The students’ and teachers’ education and safety are being compromised as a result, and there is a need for an immediate solution.</p><!--Quantifiable Examples-->
  <h2>Quantifiable Examples:</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>Out of 1000 students and teachers, only 300 can connect to the internet at any given time, which is putting a huge strain on the limited resources.</li>
   <li>One-third of the students reported that they could not complete their homework or attend online classes due to internet outages.</li>
   <li>The school administration had to resort to a manual attendance system, impeding the smooth functioning of day-to-day activities.</li>
   <li>Secondary to the internet outage, the school’s emergency phone lines were also affected, putting the safety and security of students and staff in jeopardy.</li>
  </ul><!--Solutions-->
  <h2>Three Potential Solutions:</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>Immediate backup power solutions such as generators that can ensure the school has continuity of operations in the event of a power outage.</li>
   <li>An increase in internet bandwidth and redundancy by implementing multiple independent internet connections to guarantee reliable connectivity in case of a single point of failure.</li>
   <li>Implementing a phone and internet service provider selection process that takes the number of students and their educational needs into account. This includes evaluating internet stability, support, and response time during crises such as this.</li>
  </ol><!--Conclusion-->
  <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
  <p>The internet and phone line outages in El Dorado’s schools have been a cause of concern for many students and teachers who rely on these services for their education and safety. The outages are the result of a power outage mishap, which is not in the control of the school administration, but they hold the responsibility to ensure the continuity in the event of such situations. While short-term solutions such as using a backup internet source or increasing bandwidth may alleviate the issue, a long-term solution is required.</p>
  <p>The school administration needs to look into a comprehensive approach to ensure the continuity of operations in the case of similar emergencies in the future. This includes investing in backup power solutions such as generators, evaluating internet and service provider selections based on their support and response time during emergencies, and implementing redundant internet connections for continuity of operations. These steps would guarantee continuity in education and ensure that our children have a safe and reliable learning environment.</p><!--Personal Anecdotes/Case Studies-->
