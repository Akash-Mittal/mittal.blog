   <h2>The Story</h2>
   <p>It was just another day for Captain Ravi Sharma, a senior pilot at Air India, when he received a notice from the airline's human resources department. The notice stated that he had committed a violation of the airline's rules by wearing a black watch strap instead of a brown one, which was deemed as a breach of uniform protocol.</p>
   <p>Captain Sharma was stunned as he had never heard of such a rule before. He wondered how such a small infraction could cause him to face disciplinary action from the airline. He spoke to his fellow pilots and found out that they too had received similar notices for minor infractions like not polishing their shoes or not wearing a tie on a particular day.</p>
   <p>As the news spread, pilot bodies started to question the airline's HR policies and called them draconian and unethical. They argued that such rigid rules were detrimental to the morale of the pilots and were affecting their performance in the cockpit.</p>
   <h2>Concrete Examples</h2>
   <p>According to the pilot bodies, Air India's HR policies are not only strict but also arbitrary. Some of the examples they have cited are:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Issuing notices to pilots for not keeping their hands behind their backs while speaking to seniors</li>
    <li>Demoting a pilot for not attending a "discipline awareness" course</li>
    <li>Terminating the contract of a pilot for not greeting the management team</li>
    <li>Fining a pilot for carrying a company pen in their personal belongings</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The pilot bodies argue that such policies are not only absurd but also highlight the management's lack of trust in their employees.</p>
   <h2>The Conclusion</h2>
   <p>After reviewing the situation, it is clear that Air India's HR policies are strict and rigid. However, whether they are draconian and unethical is subjective and depends on one's perspective.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, the following can be said:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>There is a need for a balance between strict HR policies and employee morale</li>
    <li>The airline should review its policies and make modifications if necessary</li>
    <li>The pilot bodies should work with the airline's management to find a middle ground and ensure that the airline operates efficiently and effectively</li>
   </ul>
