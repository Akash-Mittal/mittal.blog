  <main>
   <p>It was a typical Monday morning at Samsung headquarters in South Korea when the news broke. A sensitive code had been leaked out to the public, causing panic and confusion among the employees. The IT department was scrambling to assess the extent of the damage, while the CEO was in an emergency meeting with the board of directors.</p>
   <p>The code in question was related to the company's upcoming smartphone launch, and it contained trade secrets and confidential information. It was a huge blow to Samsung's reputation, and the company had to act fast to prevent any further leaks.</p>
   <p>As part of its cybersecurity measures, Samsung decided to ban the use of ChatGPT among its employees. ChatGPT was a popular messaging app among Samsung employees, but it had been identified as one of the sources of the leak. Samsung's IT department discovered that some employees were using ChatGPT to share sensitive information, and that's how the code had leaked out.</p>
   <p>But Samsung was not the only company affected by the leak. Other tech giants like Apple, Google, and Microsoft were also at risk of losing their trade secrets and market share to their competitors. The leak had the potential to change the course of the smartphone industry, and the fallout was huge.</p>
   <p>Apple, for example, had to change its design plans for its upcoming iPhone launch, as it had copied some of Samsung's trade secrets. Google had to beef up its cybersecurity measures to prevent any leaks from its code repository. And Microsoft had to delay its Surface launch to assess the impact of the leak on its market share.</p>
   <p>The leak had also sparked a debate on cybersecurity and corporate espionage. Many experts argued that companies should invest more in their cybersecurity measures to prevent any leaks, while others called for stricter laws and regulations to protect companies' trade secrets.</p>
