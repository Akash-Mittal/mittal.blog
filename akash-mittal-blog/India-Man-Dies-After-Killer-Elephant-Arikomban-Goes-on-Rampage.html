  <p>It was a beautiful Sunday morning when Raju, a small-town businessman, decided to take his daily walk. Little did he know that he would be facing his worst nightmare that day. As he was walking by the forest area, he encountered a killer elephant, Arikomban, who had gone rogue after being separated from his herd. In a matter of seconds, Raju's life came to an abrupt end.</p><!-- Body -->
  <h2>Elephant Attacks in India</h2>
  <p>Raju's story is not the only one of its kind in India. Elephant attacks have become increasingly common in the country with a rising human population encroaching on elephant habitats. According to a report by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, over 500 people are killed by elephants in India every year, and the number is only increasing.</p>
  <p>The issue is not just limited to the loss of human lives. Elephants, too, are facing a crisis as their natural habitats are being destroyed. The conflict has led to many elephants being captured, and some even killed.</p>
  <h2>The Root Cause of Elephant-Human Conflict</h2>
  <p>There are several reasons for the worsening conflict between humans and elephants. Here are a few quantifiable examples-</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Increase in human population - As the population of humans increases, so does the demand for land. This puts immense pressure on forests and other unoccupied areas used by elephants, leading to conflict.</li>
   <li>Decrease in elephant habitats - The destruction of forests and other natural habitats, as well as human encroachment on these lands, has significantly reduced the space available to elephants, pushing them towards human settlements.</li>
   <li>Illegal activities - The poaching of elephants for their ivory, illegal logging and mining in their natural habitats, as well as the theft of their food sources, has further exacerbated the conflict.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>The Way Forward</h2>
  <p>To resolve the conflict, it is essential to create a balance between the needs of humans and elephants. Here are three critical measures that could help bring about positive change:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Increasing the availability of resources - Providing adequate food and water sources for elephants in their natural habitats can reduce their dependence on human-occupied areas.</li>
   <li>Creating awareness and education - Educating people about the importance of elephant conservation and wildlife protection can go a long way in reducing the number of human-elephant conflicts.</li>
   <li>Taking legal action - In cases where illegal activities are the root cause of the conflict, stronger action must be taken to uphold laws and regulations. This includes stopping the poaching of elephants and the illegal harvesting of their habitats.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, the conflict between humans and elephants is real, and the need to find a solution is more critical than ever. From increasing the availability of resources to creating awareness and taking legal action against illegal activities, every stakeholder has a role to play in mitigating human-elephant conflict.</p><!--  or Case Studies --> <!-- Practical Tips When Possible --> <!-- Reference URLs and Hashtags -->
