  <h1>How Signing a Bored Ape Deal could get an Adidas Web3 Lead Fired</h1> <img src="images/Adidas-Web3-Lead-Fired-for-Signing-Bored-Ape-Deal.jpeg" alt="+Adidas-Web3-Lead-Fired-for-Signing-Bored-Ape-Deal+">
  <p>It was just another day in the life of an Adidas Web3 Lead, or so she thought. She had been approached by a collector of NFTs who wanted to collaborate with Adidas on a new line of Bored Ape clothing. The Web3 Lead saw an opportunity to combine her passion for fashion and blockchain technology. She was excited about the prospect and agreed to the collaboration with the collector. Little did she know that this decision could land her in hot water with her employer.</p>
  <p>Adidas is a global brand that values its reputation and public image. The company has strict policies about partnerships and endorsements. Any employee who signs a deal without proper clearance risks getting fired. The Web3 Lead was not aware of these guidelines and signed the Bored Ape deal without informing her superiors.</p>
  <p>Soon after, the news of the collaboration started to spread on social media. The Web3 Lead was elated to see the positive response from the NFT community. She shared the news with her colleagues, expecting them to be happy for her. However, she was met with a cold reception. Her manager was furious that she had signed a deal without permission. The Web3 Lead was called into a meeting where she was scolded and informed that she had breached company policy. She was given a warning and put on probation.</p>
  <p>This incident highlights the importance of adhering to company policies and the consequences of not doing so. The Web3 Lead was lucky to have received a warning instead of being fired. However, her reputation within the company had been tarnished, and she was no longer trusted to make important decisions on her own. Furthermore, the Bored Ape deal never materialized, and the Web3 Lead lost out on a potentially lucrative partnership.</p>
  <h2>Quantifiable examples of the importance of corporate policies</h2>
  <p>According to a study by PwC, companies with strong corporate policies have a 30% higher return on equity compared to those with weak policies. Additionally, a survey by Deloitte found that 87% of employees believe that companies with strong policies and ethical cultures are more successful and attract top talent.</p>
  <p>Moreover, a recent case study by Harvard Business Review highlighted how a lack of corporate policies can lead to disastrous outcomes. The study examined the downfall of Enron, a company that lacked proper policies, resulting in widespread fraud and corruption.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion in 3 points</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>Adhering to corporate policies is critical for success in business</li>
   <li>Companies with strong policies have higher return on equity and attract top talent</li>
   <li>The downfall of Enron shows the consequences of a lack of policies</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Personal anecdotes or case studies can be an effective way to drive home the importance of adhering to company policies. In the case of the Adidas Web3 Lead, she learned a valuable lesson about the consequences of not following proper procedures. She could have saved herself from trouble by simply seeking approval from her superiors before signing the Bored Ape deal.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, corporate policies exist for a reason, and it is crucial to follow them to avoid negative consequences. Companies that have strong policies and ethical cultures are more successful and attract top talent. Employees should always seek guidance before making important decisions to avoid risking their careers and reputations.</p>
