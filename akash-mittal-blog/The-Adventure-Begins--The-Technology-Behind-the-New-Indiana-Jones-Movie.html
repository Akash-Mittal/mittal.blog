  <p></p>
  <p>As I sat down with a friend to watch the newest Indiana Jones movie, I couldn't help but marvel at the incredible graphics and lifelike movements of the characters. It seemed like I was right there with Harrison Ford, dodging booby traps and fighting off Nazi soldiers.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>But it wasn't just the acting and special effects that made the movie so realistic. It was the underlying technology that powered it all. From motion capture to virtual reality, the movie industry is embracing the latest innovations to create a fully immersive experience for viewers.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One of the main companies behind the technology used in the Indiana Jones movie is Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM), a subsidiary of Lucasfilm. They were responsible for creating the stunning visual effects, including an epic chase scene involving a train and a waterfall.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>ILM utilized a variety of tools, including drones, lidar scanning, and photogrammetry, to capture real-world environments and objects and turn them into 3D models that could be used in the movie.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another key player in the technology behind the movie is Epic Games, the creator of the Unreal Engine. This game engine was used to create the virtual environments and characters that Indy and his crew interact with throughout the movie.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>But it's not just the big companies that are pushing the boundaries of technology in the movie industry. Small startups like Mo-Sys, which developed a camera tracking system used in the movie, are also making significant contributions.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Overall, the new Indiana Jones movie is a testament to the impressive advancements in technology in the past few years. With every new movie, the bar is raised higher and higher, and viewers are treated to an increasingly immersive experience.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Three critical comments:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. While the technology used in the movie is impressive, it does have some drawbacks. For example, relying too heavily on virtual environments and special effects can sometimes take away from the authenticity of the movie.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. The cost of utilizing cutting-edge technology in movies is also a concern. Big-budget films like the new Indiana Jones movie can afford to invest in expensive equipment and software, but smaller studios may struggle to keep up.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. There is also a concern that relying too much on digital effects could lead to a homogenization of movies. As more films use the same technology, there is a risk that they will start to look and feel the same, which could lead to a decline in creativity and originality.</p>
