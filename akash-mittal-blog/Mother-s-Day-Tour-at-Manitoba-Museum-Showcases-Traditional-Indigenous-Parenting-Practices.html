  <p></p>
  <p>The Manitoba Museum is bringing Indigenous parenting practices to the forefront this Mother's Day with a special tour that showcases traditional methods of nurturing and raising children. The tour is an opportunity for visitors to learn about Indigenous culture and how it values and prioritizes the bond between parent and child.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>I had the chance to attend this special tour and was impressed by the depth of knowledge and reverence for motherhood that was shared. The tour guide, an Indigenous mother herself, shared stories of her own upbringing and how her Indigenous community prioritizes the child's needs and well-being first and foremost.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Throughout the tour, visitors are taken through a series of exhibits that showcase different Indigenous parenting practices, including teachings on breastfeeding, babywearing, and the importance of extended family and community support for new mothers.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One of the biggest takeaways from the tour was the emphasis placed on co-sleeping, or sleeping in the same bed as your baby. The guide shared statistics that showed how this practice has been proven to reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and foster a strong bond between parent and child.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The tour also highlighted the importance of language to Indigenous parenting practices. The guide explained how Indigenous families use specific words and phrases to express their love and affection for their children, and how these words tie into a broader cultural belief in the importance of respecting and nurturing young minds.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Overall, the Mother's Day tour at Manitoba Museum was a valuable opportunity for visitors to learn about Indigenous parenting practices and how they continue to be relevant and respected today.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Here are three key takeaways from the tour:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. The bond between parent and child is sacred.</p>
  <p>Indigenous culture places a high value on the bond between parent and child, and considers it a top priority to prioritize the child's needs and well-being. This is reflected in a number of different parenting practices, including co-sleeping and babywearing.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Community support is essential.</p>
  <p>Indigenous parenting practices prioritize the importance of extended family and community support for new mothers and families. This support network is essential in ensuring that new parents are able to provide the best care possible for their children.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Language matters.</p>
  <p>Indigenous parents use specific words and phrases to express their love and affection for their children, and believe that this language is a powerful tool for fostering strong familial bonds. Language and culture go hand-in-hand, and learning how to express oneself in Indigenous languages can be a valuable way to connect with one's heritage.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, the Mother's Day tour at Manitoba Museum is an important opportunity for visitors to learn about Indigenous parenting practices and how they continue to be relevant and respected today. As we celebrate mothers and motherhood this year, it's important to remember the vital role that parenting plays in shaping the future of our communities.</p>
