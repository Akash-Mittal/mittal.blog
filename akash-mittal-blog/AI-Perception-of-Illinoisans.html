   <p>What do Illinoisans look like? According to artificial intelligence, the typical Illinoisan is a white female in her 30s with brown hair and blue eyes. The algorithm used publicly available data to create an image of the average Illinois resident.</p>
   <p>As it turns out, the algorithm's perception of Illinoisans is not far off from reality. In a survey conducted by the University of Illinois, more than 75% of respondents said that the AI-generated image resembled someone they knew.</p>
   <p>While it may seem like a trivial exercise, the AI-generated image can have implications for marketing, product design, and even law enforcement.</p>
   
   <ul>
    <li>In a study on facial recognition technology, researchers found that the algorithms were more accurate at identifying white men than women and people of color.</li>
    <li>A survey of car accident victims found that those with more stereotypically "feminine" facial features were more likely to be blamed for the accident, even if they were not at fault.</li>
    <li>A study on job interviews found that interviewers rated candidates higher if they resembled the interviewer, even if the candidate was less qualified than others.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>These examples show how people's appearances can influence their experiences and opportunities. By creating AI-generated images of "typical" individuals, we may inadvertently perpetuate stereotypes and biases.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, the AI perception of Illinoisans is not only interesting but also has real-world implications. As AI continues to play an increasingly important role in our lives, it's important to be aware of its potential biases and limitations. By understanding the limitations of AI, we can work to create more equal and just societies.</p>
