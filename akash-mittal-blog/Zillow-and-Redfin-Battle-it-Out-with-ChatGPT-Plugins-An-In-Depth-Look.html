    <h2>The Story of Zillow and Redfin's Battle for the Best ChatGPT Plugin</h2>
    <p>It all started when Zillow, the popular real estate company, decided to launch their own ChatGPT plugin. This new feature would allow customers to ask questions about properties and receive real-time answers from Zillow's AI-powered system. However, just a few weeks after Zillow's announcement, Redfin, another major player in the real estate industry, followed suit and launched their own version of the ChatGPT plugin.</p>
    <p>Both companies claim that their ChatGPT plugin is the best in the industry, but which one is truly superior? Let's take a closer look.</p>
