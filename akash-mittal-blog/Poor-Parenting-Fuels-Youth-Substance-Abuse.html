    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>It was a typical Saturday evening in Suva when a 14-year-old boy, who we'll call Jay, was brought to the Colonial War Memorial Hospital by a group of his friends. He had passed out after drinking large amounts of alcohol and smoking marijuana for the first time. His friends were worried and didn't know what to do, so they called an ambulance. Jay's parents were called to the hospital and were shocked to see their son in such a state. They had no idea he was drinking or taking drugs, so they assumed his friends must have pressured him into it. But as we talked to Jay and his friends, we learnt that it was actually a cry for help- a result of poor parenting.</p>

    <p>Jay's story is not uncommon in Fiji. According to a survey by the National Substance Abuse Advisory Council (NSAAC), 70% of Fijian youths have tried alcohol before the age of 18, and 40% have tried marijuana. These figures are alarming, and it is clear that poor parenting is contributing to the growing problem of substance abuse among Fijian youths. A study by the Fiji Women's Crisis Centre found that exposure to violence, poor communication, and lack of positive role models are the main factors that lead to ineffective parenting, which in turn leads to youth substance abuse.</p>
    <p>It's not just about the parents being absent or abusive. Even well-meaning parents can end up failing their child if they have ineffective communication or lack knowledge about the dangers of substance abuse. The same study by the Fiji Women's Crisis Centre found that parents who had poor communication with their children were more likely to have children who abused substances.</p>

    <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
    <p>How can you prevent your child from falling into the trap of substance abuse? Here are some practical tips:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Communicate openly and honestly with your child about the dangers of substance abuse. Don't just lecture- listen to what they have to say too.</li>
     <li>Set clear rules and consequences regarding substance use. Make sure your child understands that there will be consequences if they break these rules.</li>
     <li>Encourage your child to engage in positive activities like sports or creative hobbies. This will keep them busy and give them a sense of purpose and achievement.</li>
     <li>Be a positive role model yourself. Your child learns from your behaviour, so practice what you preach.</li>
     <li>Seek professional help if you suspect your child is already abusing substances. Don't wait until it's too late.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Poor parenting is a major contributor to youth substance abuse in Fiji. Parents need to be aware of the dangers and signs of substance abuse, and take a proactive approach to parenting. Effective communication, setting clear rules, and encouraging positive activities are key to preventing substance abuse. However, if you suspect your child is already abusing substances, seek professional help immediately. Let's work together to ensure that our youth have a bright and healthy future.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, we can say that better parenting leads to a better society.</p><!-- Reference URLS: Provide URLs to similar articles and research -->
