     <h2>Story</h2>
     <p>Have you ever wished that you could watch your favorite shows for free on Amazon Prime? Well, now you can! Amazon has launched free channels on their streaming service, offering a range of TV shows and movies at no additional cost.</p>
     <p>Meanwhile, Gmail has added a new feature that allows users to see when their emails have been sent, delivered, and read. This check mark system is similar to the one used on messaging apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.</p>
     <p>And speaking of technology, OpenAI has just raised an additional $1 billion in funding, bringing their valuation to over $15 billion. This artificial intelligence research lab, co-founded by Elon Musk, is focused on building AI that is safe and beneficial for humanity.</p>

     <h2>Real Life Examples</h2>
     <p>With Amazon's free channels, viewers can now watch popular shows like "Downton Abbey," "Mad Men," and "Frasier" without paying extra. This move is part of Amazon's strategy to compete with other streaming services like Netflix and Hulu.</p>
     <p>The new check mark system on Gmail is a game-changer for email communication. No longer do you have to wonder if your important message has been received and read by the recipient. This feature is especially useful for business emails where timely responses are crucial.</p>
     <p>OpenAI's latest funding round includes investors like Microsoft and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. The company is working on projects like developing AI systems that can understand natural language and creating robots that can perform complex tasks.</p>
