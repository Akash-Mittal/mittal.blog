   <p>One day, a Reddit user asked a complete stranger named ChatGPT to apply for jobs on his behalf. The reasons behind this decision are not entirely clear, but the anonymous user claimed he had "anxiety" and found the job search process overwhelming. ChatGPT, who apparently had a lot of spare time on his hands, agreed to help out and began sending out applications using the user's resume and cover letter.</p>
   <p>What happened next was quite shocking: the user began receiving a flood of interview calls, many of which he was not prepared for. He quickly realized that having someone else apply for jobs on his behalf was a bad idea, as he was not well-equipped to answer questions about his own resume and experience. He was also at a severe disadvantage compared to other jobseekers who had put in the time and effort to tailor their applications to specific positions.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, this kind of behavior is not uncommon among jobseekers. Many people become overwhelmed or frustrated with the job search process, to the point where they are willing to delegate the responsibility to others. However, this is unlikely to lead to positive outcomes, as job interviews require a certain level of preparation and personal insight.</p>
   <p>Here are some concrete examples of why delegating job applications is a bad idea:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>It shows a lack of initiative and motivation, which may be unappealing to employers</li>
    <li>It makes it difficult to prepare for interviews, as the candidate is not familiar with the applications they have submitted</li>
    <li>It can lead to embarrassing situations, such as when the candidate is unable to answer basic questions about their own experience</li>
   </ul>
   <p>In conclusion, the job search process can be stressful and overwhelming, but it is important to take responsibility for one's own applications and interviews. Delegating this responsibility to others is unlikely to lead to positive outcomes, and may even harm one's chances of finding a job. Jobseekers should take the time to tailor their applications to specific positions, prepare for interviews, and demonstrate their initiative and motivation.</p>
