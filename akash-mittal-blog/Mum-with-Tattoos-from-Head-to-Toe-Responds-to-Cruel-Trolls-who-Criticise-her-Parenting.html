    <p>Emily, a proud mother of two from Manchester, has endured her fair share of criticism online. But it's not just her parenting style that has been targeted. It's her tattoos that cover her entire body.</p>
    <p>Emily has always loved tattoos and sees them as a form of self-expression. She says they tell the story of her life and the things she's been through. But not everyone agrees.</p>
    <p>Emily has been called everything from a bad influence to a danger to her children. Some have even suggested that her tattoos could lead to her children being taken away from her. It's a cruel and unfair stereotype, but one that Emily refuses to back down from.</p>
    <p>In a recent interview, Emily spoke out against the trolls and the criticism she has faced. She said, "I've heard it all before. People assume that because I have tattoos, I must be a bad mother. But my tattoos have nothing to do with my ability to parent. I love my children more than anything in the world, and I would do anything to protect them."</p>
    <p>Emily's story is not unique. Many parents with tattoos have faced similar judgement and discrimination. But she refuses to let the haters get her down. Instead, she uses her experiences to educate and inspire others.</p>
    
    <p>Emily is not alone in her experiences. According to a survey conducted by OnePoll, 49% of people believe that parents with tattoos are less likely to be good parents. This is despite the fact that there is no evidence to support this claim.</p>
    <p>The survey also found that 71% of parents with tattoos have been judged or discriminated against because of their tattoos. This figure is even higher for mothers, with 84% reporting that they have been judged or discriminated against.</p>
    <p>These statistics show just how prevalent the stereotype is and how damaging it can be for those who are on the receiving end of it.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>Parenting ability has nothing to do with tattoos.</li>
     <li>Judging someone based on their appearance is unfair and hurtful.</li>
     <li>We need to challenge stereotypes and celebrate diversity.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Emily's story is a reminder that we should never judge someone based on their appearance. Tattoos do not make someone a bad person or a bad parent. We need to challenge stereotypes and celebrate diversity, rather than perpetuate harmful and outdated beliefs.</p>
    <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
    <h3>1. Educate yourself</h3>
    <p>Before making assumptions about someone based on their appearance, take the time to get to know them. Ask questions and listen to their stories. You may be surprised by what you learn.</p>
    <h3>2. Challenge stereotypes</h3>
    <p>If you hear someone making a negative comment about someone's appearance, don't be afraid to speak up. Challenge their beliefs and offer a different perspective.</p>
    <h3>3. Celebrate diversity</h3>
    <p>We all have different backgrounds, experiences, and ways of expressing ourselves. Instead of trying to fit everyone into the same box, celebrate the things that make us unique.</p>
