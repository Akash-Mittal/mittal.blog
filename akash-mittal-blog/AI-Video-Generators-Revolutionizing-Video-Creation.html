  <p>Have you ever felt frustrated trying to create a compelling marketing video for your business? Or struggled to communicate a complex idea through video content? If so, you're not alone. Video creation can be time-consuming, expensive and requires specialized skills.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>But what if there was a solution that could streamline the video creation process, save time and allow you to produce high-quality videos without any prior experience? Enter AI video generators – the latest innovation in video creation technology.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In this article, we'll compare the eight best AI video generators in 2023 and explore how they're revolutionizing the video creation process.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>But first, let me tell you a story.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Back in 2019, when I was starting my own business, I wanted to create a marketing video to promote my service. I had no experience in video creation, and hiring a professional seemed too expensive. So, I decided to DIY it. I spent hours looking for the right template, gathering footage, and editing it all together – only to realize that the final product was mediocre at best.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Fast forward to 2023 – with the advent of AI video generators, I'm now able to create high-quality videos in a fraction of the time with little to no experience. And I'm not the only one benefiting from this technology.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>A recent study by Cisco predicts that by 2023, more than 80% of all consumer internet traffic will be video. With such high demand, businesses cannot afford to ignore the potential of video marketing. And AI video generators are the answer to this challenge.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable Examples</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Let's explore some quantifiable examples of how AI video generators are improving video creation.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Time-Saving: According to a study by Hubspot, it can take up to 40 hours to create a single video. With AI video generators, this time can be reduced to as little as five minutes, as the software automates many of the processes involved in video creation.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Cost-Effective: Traditional video creation can be expensive, with costs ranging from $6000-$10000 per minute of video. In contrast, AI video generators are available at a fraction of the cost, with some providers offering unlimited videos for a monthly subscription fee.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Increased Engagement: Videos created with AI video generators have been shown to increase engagement on social media by up to 120%. This is because AI video generators can create videos that are optimized for social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.</p>
