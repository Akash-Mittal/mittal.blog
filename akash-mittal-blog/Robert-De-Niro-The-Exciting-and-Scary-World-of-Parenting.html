     <p>It was a hot summer day in New York City and Robert De Niro was walking in Central Park with his two-year-old son. Suddenly, his son ran away from him and ran towards a pond. De Niro panicked and chased after him. Just as he reached his son, the child stumbled and almost fell into the pond. De Niro was able to catch him just in time, but the experience left him shaken. This incident made him realise that being a parent is not easy, but it is also one of the most rewarding experiences of his life.</p>

     <h2>The Scary Part of Parenting</h2>
     <p>Despite the many joys of parenting, there are also many challenges and fears that come with the responsibility of raising children. Robert De Niro knows this all too well, having raised seven children.</p>
     <p>One of the scariest parts of parenting, according to De Niro, is the fear of something happening to your child. Whether it's an accident, illness, or any other potential danger, the thought of something happening to your child can be overwhelming. This is why De Niro is always vigilant and takes every precaution to keep his children safe.</p>
     <p>Another scary aspect of parenting is the worry that you're not doing a good enough job. De Niro admits that he sometimes feels this way, despite having raised seven successful children. He believes that every parent doubts themselves at some point, but it's important to remember that it's normal and to keep doing your best.</p>
     <p>Finally, De Niro also believes that the responsibility of parenting can be scary in and of itself. It's a huge responsibility to raise a child and prepare them for the world. The decisions you make can have a profound impact on their lives, and this can be intimidating at times.</p>
