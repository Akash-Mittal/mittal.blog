  <p>Have you ever had a friend or family member ask you for a recommendation on a product or service? It's a common occurrence in our daily lives – we trust the opinions of those we know and often seek out their recommendations before making a decision.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The same concept applies in the world of donor partnership and fundraising. Individual referral sharing – where current or past donors recommend the organization to their personal networks – can be a powerful tool in reaching new potential donors.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Let's take a look at some quantifiable examples of the impact of individual referral sharing:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>- A study by marketing analytics firm Custora found that customer referral programs had an average conversion rate of 2.3%, compared to just 0.5% for other forms of marketing.</p>
  <p>- The fundraising platform CauseVox reported that referral fundraising campaigns on their platform had an average donation amount of $80, compared to just $55 for non-referral campaigns.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>These statistics show that not only can individual referral sharing reach a wider audience, it can also result in higher donations and conversions.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>So how can organizations encourage and leverage individual referral sharing in their donor partnerships? Here are three key steps:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Provide a clear and compelling message: Donors are more likely to share an organization's message if they understand and believe in the cause. Make sure your messaging is clear, concise, and emotionally appealing.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Make sharing easy: Provide tools and resources for donors to easily share on social media or through email. Consider creating personalized landing pages for donors to direct their contacts to.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Show appreciation: Donors who feel appreciated are more likely to continue supporting an organization and sharing their message. Consider sending personalized thank-you messages or recognition on social media.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One example of a successful individual referral sharing campaign is the National Kidney Foundation's "Share Your Spare" program. The organization encourages current donors to share their story with friends and family and ask for a donation to support the cause. The program has resulted in over $1 million in donations and helped increase awareness of kidney disease.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Personal anecdotes and case studies can also be effective in illustrating the power of individual referral sharing. For example, a friend of mine recently shared a post on Facebook about a local animal rescue organization she had donated to. As a result, I donated to the organization as well and shared the post on my own social media accounts, resulting in additional donations from my personal network.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, individual referral sharing can be a valuable tool in donor partnership and fundraising efforts. By providing a clear message, making sharing easy, and showing appreciation, organizations can leverage the power of personal networks to reach new potential donors.</p>
