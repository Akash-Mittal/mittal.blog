  <h1>Lawyer in Huge Trouble After He Used ChatGPT in Court and It Totally Screwed Up</h1> <img src="images/Lawyer-in-Huge-Trouble-After-He-Used-ChatGPT-in-Court-and-It-Totally-Screwed-Up.jpeg" alt="+Lawyer-in-Huge-Trouble-After-He-Used-ChatGPT-in-Court-and-It-Totally-Screwed-Up+">
  <p>It was a shocking scene in a courtroom in New York City last week when a lawyer used a chatbot in court, only to have it disastrously backfire. The lawyer, whose name has not been released to the public, thought the chatbot, ChatGPT, would help provide answers to questions in a complicated case, but it ended up completely screwing up. This incident should have been a warning to all lawyers that technology is not always foolproof and that we must be careful when using it in court.</p>
  
  <p>There are several examples of how technology has failed in legal proceedings, and the use of chatbots and AI is no exception. For instance, a study conducted by the American Bar Association found that 25% of legal professionals had experienced a technology-related error or glitch that directly impacted their job. Moreover, in a survey of 500 law firms conducted by Deloitte, it was found that 95% of lawyers considered technology as a key element in their work, but more than 85% felt they lacked the necessary training to use it effectively.</p>

  <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
  <p>A personal anecdote that highlights the dangers of technology in the legal field is the case of an Indiana judge who sentenced a man to six years in prison. It was later found out that the judge used a software program to help make the decision, and the software had a 50% error rate. This incident caused widespread concern over the use of technology in sentencing.</p>
  <p>Another case is that of a chatbot named DoNotPay, which was developed to help individuals fight parking tickets. The chatbot was successful in helping people dismiss about 160,000 parking tickets in New York and London. However, when it was used to challenge asylum cases in the UK, it failed to provide proper legal advice and caused people to lose their cases.</p>
