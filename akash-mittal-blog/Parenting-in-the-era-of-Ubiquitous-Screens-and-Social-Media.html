    <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
    <p>John, a father of two, noticed that his children were constantly on their smartphones or tablets. He decided to set a rule that all electronic devices had to be off during meals and family time. At first, his children protested, but soon they started to enjoy their offline activities, such as playing board games and talking to each other.</p>
    <p>Another example is Emily, a 14-year-old girl who was a victim of cyberbullying. Her parents worked with the school and the local authorities to stop the harassment. They also encouraged Emily to write down her feelings in a journal and talk to a therapist to overcome the trauma.</p>
