  <h1>South Korea's Naver to Target Foreign Governments with Latest ChatGPT Like AI Model</h1> <img src="images/South-Korea-s-Naver-to-Target-Foreign-Governments-with-Latest-ChatGPT-Like-AI-Model.jpeg" alt="+South-Korea-s-Naver-to-Target-Foreign-Governments-with-Latest-ChatGPT-Like-AI-Model+">
  <p>South Korea's leading online search portal and artificial intelligence (AI) company, Naver, has developed a new AI-powered chatbot that mimics human communication, called <i>CLOVA Chatting</i>. This new model can simulate a human-like conversation efficiently by using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms.</p>
  <p>Interestingly, Naver is aiming to target foreign governments and public institutions that need to communicate with non-native speakers, especially in countries like Japan, China, and Vietnam. This innovative technology has already received a patent application with the Korean Intellectual Property Office as well as permission to export the software by South Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy.</p>
  
  <p>Imagine a scenario where a foreign government needs to communicate with its citizens, but there are language barriers that can hinder the efficiency of the communication process. For example, a Japanese citizen applies for a visa to work in South Korea, and the application process requires communication with the local government in Korean language. The language barrier can be a major obstacle in such situations.</p>
  <p>This is where Naver's new AI-powered chatbot, <i>CLOVA Chatting</i>, can come to the rescue. The chatbot can use NLP to understand natural language and machine learning algorithms to simulate human-like conversations. With this technology, foreign governments can communicate effectively with their citizens in various languages, eliminating the need for language experts and saving time and resources.</p>
  
  <p>According to Naver, the <i>CLOVA Chatting</i> model has achieved a 36.3% improvement in performance compared to the previous model, which was developed in 2018. This improvement in performance was measured by evaluating the chatbot's ability to understand and respond to a variety of topics, including health, travel, and shopping.</p>
  <p>Moreover, the new model has achieved remarkable results in understanding non-native languages. For instance, when tested with a sample conversation in Chinese, the chatbot showed an accuracy rate of 78%. Similarly, when tested with a sample conversation in Japanese, the accuracy rate was 82%. These results indicate that <i>CLOVA Chatting</i> has the potential to revolutionize communication between people who speak different languages.</p>
