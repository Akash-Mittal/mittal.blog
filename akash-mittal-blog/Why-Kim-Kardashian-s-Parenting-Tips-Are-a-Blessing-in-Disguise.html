    <li>Start your day with exercise: A quick 20-minute workout can be enough to get your blood pumping and your mind focused. It doesn't have to be anything elaborate. Just a few stretches, push-ups, and squats can do the trick.</li>
    <li>Make a to-do list: Prioritizing your tasks for the day can help you stay on track and avoid feeling overwhelmed. Start by making a list of everything that needs to be done, and then prioritize them according to importance and urgency.</li>
