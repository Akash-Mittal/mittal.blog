   <p>Once upon a time, web browsers were simple tools that allowed us to browse the web. But today's browsers are much more than that. They are platforms that offer a wide range of features, from built-in ad blockers to password managers and integrated messengers.</p>
   <p>Two of the most innovative browsers when it comes to features are Opera and Microsoft Edge. Both offer a side panel that provides quick access to a range of useful tools, such as bookmarks, history, and downloads. But now, Opera is taking this innovation even further with the introduction of its own AI-powered side panel.</p>
   
   <p>So, how is Opera's AI side panel going to change the browsing experience? Here are some examples:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>When you highlight a piece of text on a webpage, the AI side panel will offer to search for more information on that topic, without you having to copy and paste the text into a search engine.</li>
    <li>If you're browsing a recipe website, the AI side panel will offer to convert the ingredients and measurements into your preferred units.</li>
    <li>If you're shopping online, the AI side panel will show you similar products and reviews to help you make a more informed purchasing decision.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>An </h2>
   <p>Are you tired of manually searching for information, converting units, and comparing products while you browse? Then you need to know about Opera's AI side panel.</p>
   <h2></h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Opera's AI side panel is a game-changer that sets the bar even higher for the future of web browsers.</li>
    <li>The AI side panel offers a range of useful features that are designed to save time and make browsing more convenient.</li>

   <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
   <p>As someone who spends a lot of time browsing the web, I'm always on the lookout for tools and features that can make my life easier. And Opera's AI side panel certainly does that.</p>
   <p>One of my favorite things about the AI side panel is how it automatically adapts to the content you're viewing. For example, if I'm reading an article about a particular topic, the AI side panel will offer to search for more information on that topic, without me having to copy and paste the text into a search engine. It might not seem like a big deal, but it definitely saves time and makes browsing more efficient.</p>
   <p>I've also found the AI side panel to be very helpful when it comes to online shopping. It's always frustrating when you're trying to compare products and you have to keep switching between different tabs and windows. But with the AI side panel, I can easily see similar products and reviews, all without leaving the page I'm on.</p>
   <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Make sure you have the latest version of Opera installed to take advantage of the AI side panel.</li>
    <li>Experiment with the different features in the AI side panel to see how they can help you save time and browse more efficiently.</li>
