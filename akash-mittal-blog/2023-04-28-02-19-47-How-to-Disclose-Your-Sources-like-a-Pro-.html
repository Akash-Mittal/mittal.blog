  <p>When it comes to writing an interesting article, it's important to not only have concrete examples but also to disclose your sources properly. The following story illustrates why.</p>
  <p>Imagine you're a journalist working on a story about a controversial new drug. You've spent months researching, interviewing experts, and gathering data. Finally, you publish your article, which makes some bold claims about the drug's effectiveness and safety.</p>
  <p>However, soon after the article is published, other journalists start questioning your sources. Some of the experts you quoted deny ever speaking to you, while others claim that their quotes were taken out of context. As the controversy grows, your credibility as a journalist is called into question.</p>
  <p>What went wrong? It's simple - you didn't disclose your sources properly. In this case, you may have fabricated some of the quotes, or failed to properly attribute them to the correct individuals. As a journalist, it's crucial to maintain the utmost integrity by providing accurate sources for all information presented in your article.</p>
  <p>Here are some concrete examples of how to disclose your sources like a pro:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Provide full names and titles of individuals quoted in your article, along with their contact information if possible.</li>
   <li>List any publications or studies referenced in your article, and provide links to them if available.</li>
   <li>Include a "Sources" or "References" section at the end of your article, listing all sources used in alphabetical order.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>By following these best practices for disclosing sources, you can establish yourself as a trustworthy journalist and build a loyal readership.</p>
