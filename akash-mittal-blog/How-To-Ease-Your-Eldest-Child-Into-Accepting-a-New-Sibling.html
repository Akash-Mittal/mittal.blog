   <h2>Introduction: The Story of Emily and Noah</h2>
   <p>Emily was a happy six-year-old girl who loved playing with her toys and spending time with her parents. She was the only child in the family and enjoyed all the attention and love she received from her parents, especially her mother.</p>
   <p>However, when Emily's mother got pregnant, Emily's feelings started to change. She was excited about the idea of having a sibling but also felt anxious and worried about losing her parents' attention and love. She didn't know how to express her feelings and often felt sad and confused.</p>
   <p>Emily's parents noticed her behavior and decided to take action. They talked to her about the baby, read books, played games, and involved her in the preparation for the new arrival. They also reassured her that they would always love her and that having a sibling would only add more love and joy to their family.</p>
   <p>After a few weeks, Emily started to feel more comfortable and excited about being a big sister. She enjoyed feeling the baby kicking and talking to her mother's belly. She also looked forward to helping her parents take care of the baby and teach her new things.</p>
   <p>When the baby was born, Emily was over the moon with happiness and pride. She loved holding her tiny sibling and taking care of her. She also realized that having a sibling was fun and rewarding, and that she could still have her parents' attention and love.</p>
   
   <ul>
    <li>A study conducted by the University of Cambridge found that children who were prepared for the arrival of a new sibling were more likely to have positive feelings and relationships with their siblings in the long term.</li>
    <li>According to a survey by BabyCenter, 56% of parents reported that their older child felt jealous or resentful after the arrival of a new sibling.</li>
    <li>However, the same survey found that 82% of parents reported that their older child adjusted well to the new sibling within six months.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Tips for Easing Your Eldest Child Into Accepting a New Sibling</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Prepare your child for the new arrival by talking to them about the baby, reading books about siblings, and involving them in the preparation process (e.g., decorating the nursery, choosing baby clothes).</li>
    <li>Reassure your child that you love them and that having a sibling will only add more love and joy to the family. Also, remind them of all the fun and exciting things they can do together as siblings.</li>
    <li>Allocate special one-on-one time with your older child before and after the baby's arrival to make them feel valued and loved. This can be as simple as reading a book together, playing a game, or going for a walk.</li>
    <li>Encourage your child's involvement in caring for the baby. For example, they can help with diaper-changing, feeding, or playing with the baby. This will help them feel important and needed.</li>
    <li>Be patient and understanding with your child's feelings. It's normal for them to feel jealous or resentful at first, but with time and support, they will adjust and love their sibling.</li>
   </ol>
