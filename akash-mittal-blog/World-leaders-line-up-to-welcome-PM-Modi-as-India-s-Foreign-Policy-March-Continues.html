  <p>It was a moment of pride for India when recently many World leaders welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his foreign visits. Among the dignitaries were the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, President of the United States, Joe Biden, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, and many others. All these eminent personalities extended a warm welcome to the Indian Prime Minister, acknowledging his contribution to the world.</p>
  <p>Prime Minister Modi has been instrumental in bringing India's foreign policy to the forefront. His visits to different countries aim to strengthen India's diplomatic and economic ties with other nations. Here are some of the quantifiable examples that prove PM Modi's efforts are bearing fruitful results:</p>
  <h2>1. Strategic partnerships with the United States</h2>
  <p>PM Modi's frequent visits to the United States have resulted in building strong economic and strategic ties with the country. The two countries have collaborated in various sectors like defense, energy, space, and technology. India and the United States have also signed the Industrial Security Annex (ISA) to exchange classified military information, which will strengthen their defense partnership further.</p>
  <h2>2. Improvement of India-China relations</h2>
  <p>India and China have had a strained relationship in the past, but PM Modi's recent visits have brought some relief. In 2018, PM Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed on a strategic guidance, which aims to maintain peace and stability at the borders. Additionally, both countries have agreed to increase people-to-people exchanges, strengthen economic ties, and enhance military interactions.</p>
  <h2>3. Boosting trade relations with Japan</h2>
  <p>PM Modi has a good rapport with Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshihide Suga, and the two countries have witnessed a significant boost in trade relations in the past few years. Japan has invested heavily in India, particularly in the infrastructure and technology sectors. Recently, India and Japan signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the cooperation between their armed forces, enabling them to undertake joint exercises, training and research, among other things.</p>
  <p>PM Modi's foreign policy has brought India to the center stage of the world map, and his visits to different countries have given India a unique identity. With his efforts, India has strengthened its ties with other nations, and its economic growth is accelerating. Here are some personal anecdotes that illustrate PM Modi's contribution to India:</p>

  <h4>2. Increase in India's foreign direct investment</h4>
