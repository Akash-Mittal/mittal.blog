  <p>Parenting is not an easy job. As a parent, we always try to do the best for our children. We want to help them grow up to be happy, healthy, successful adults. But sometimes, our efforts to do so can backfire. That's why it's important to make subtle shifts in our parenting style. In this article, we'll discuss three of those subtle shifts that can help you train up your child.</p>
  <h2>Subtle Shift #1: Focus on the Process, not the Outcome</h2>
  <p>As parents, we want our children to succeed. We want them to get good grades, win sports games, and eventually, get into a good college and land a great job. But when we focus too much on the outcome, we miss out on the opportunity to teach our children valuable life skills.</p>
  <p>For example, let's say your child comes home from school with a C on a math test. Instead of just berating them for not doing better, focus on the process. Ask them how they studied for the test, and what they could do differently next time. Help them come up with a plan for improving their grade, rather than just focusing on the fact that they got a C.</p>
  <h2>Subtle Shift #2: Build Resilience through Failure</h2>
  <p>Failure is a part of life. We all experience it at some point or another. But as parents, our natural instinct is to protect our children from failure. We want to shield them from pain and disappointment.</p>
  <p>However, research has shown that building resilience through failure can actually help our children succeed in the long run. So instead of trying to protect them from failure, teach your children how to bounce back from it. Help them see failure as an opportunity to learn and grow, rather than the end of the world.</p>
  <h2>Subtle Shift #3: Let Your Child Make Decisions</h2>
  <p>As parents, we love our children and want the best for them. But sometimes, our desire to control their lives can be counterproductive. By letting your child make decisions, you give them the opportunity to learn from their mistakes and develop important decision-making skills.</p>
  <p>Of course, this doesn't mean you should let your child make every decision on their own. As a parent, it's our job to guide and support our children. But by giving them some autonomy, we allow them to build confidence and independence.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>These subtle shifts in parenting style may seem small, but they can make a big difference in how our children grow up. By focusing on the process, building resilience through failure, and letting our children make decisions, we can help train up our children to become happy, healthy, successful adults.</p>
