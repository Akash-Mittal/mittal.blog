   <title>India to host virtual SCO Summit Voice of Nigeria</title>
   <h1>India to host virtual SCO Summit: Voice of Nigeria</h1> <img src="images/India-to-host-virtual-SCO-Summit-Voice-of-Nigeria.jpeg" alt="+India-to-host-virtual-SCO-Summit-Voice-of-Nigeria+">
   <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is a Eurasian political, economic, and security alliance founded on 15 June 2001 in Shanghai, China. Its members include China, Russia, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. The SCO's aim is to maintain regional peace, security and stability, and to promote cooperation between its member states in various fields, including economy, trade, culture, and science and technology. India is set to host the 21st SCO summit virtually on 17 September 2021.</p>
   <p>The decision to hold the conference online is due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has impacted the entire world in one way or the other. It also reflects the new normal of hosting events in a virtual space. During the summit, the member countries will participate in discussions around issues of regional and global significance. This year's theme is "Shanghai Spirit, Solidarity and Pragmatism, Innovation and Development".</p>
   <p>India joining the SCO on 9 June 2017 as a full member marked a milestone in the organisation. India brought with it a rich cultural heritage, scientific advancements, an emerging economy, and a robust democracy. India's membership expanded the scope and reach of the organisation, providing it with a wider range of resources and expertise. India's participation in the various SCO projects has served to boost the economic and social development of the region, improving the quality of life of its people. The 2021 virtual summit is a great way for India to further strengthen its ties with the SCO member countries.</p>
   <p>As a founding member of the SCO, China has a significant presence in the summit. Chinese President, Xi Jinping, is expected to participate in the summit, and will likely discuss issues of regional and global importance, including the ongoing pandemic, trade, economics, and security. China's dynamic economy has emerged as one of the driving forces behind the global economy, and it has been actively promoting regional and global cooperation among developing and emerging economies. The SCO summit provides an ideal forum for China to promote its vision of a shared community of prosperity and development.</p>
   <p>One of the key points of discussion during the summit is the economic cooperation between the member countries. The SCO member countries have a combined population of around 3.7 billion people, making it one of the most significant economic blocs in the world. The organisation has been working towards developing a shared economic space that will promote trade, investment, and technology transfer between the member states. The SCO's regional development bank has been instrumental in financing various infrastructure projects in the region, including transportation, energy, and telecoms. The successful implementation of these projects has facilitated economic growth and development in the region.</p>
   <p>The SCO summit provides a platform for India to showcase its tech prowess. India is a leader in the field of information technology, and it has been actively pursuing a policy of digitalisation to improve governance and service delivery. The summit provides an ideal opportunity for India to showcase its expertise in the areas of e-governance, smart cities, and digital connectivity. Most recently, India launched the National Digital Health Mission which aims to provide every Indian with a unique digital health ID. India's participation in the summit can help the country to move towards achieving its goal of becoming a leading digital economy.</p>
