  <p></p>
  <p>Carrie Bickmore, the award-winning Australian television presenter and host of The Project, recently made a cameo on the beloved children's animated series Bluey. The episode, which aired on October 5th, saw Bickmore playing the role of a train driver, adding another highlight to her already successful career.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>But Bickmore's role in Bluey isn't just a testament to her acting prowess; it's also a reflection of her success as a parent. Bickmore is a mother to three children, and her ability to balance her career and family life has been an inspiration to many.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Here are three key takeaways from Carrie Bickmore's success as a parent and career woman:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Prioritizing Family</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Despite her busy schedule, Bickmore always puts her family first. In an interview with The Australian Women's Weekly, she revealed that she often takes her children with her on work trips to ensure she's able to spend time with them. She also emphasizes the importance of quality time over quantity, noting that it's not about being there for every single moment but rather making the most of the time you do have.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Bickmore's priorities are reflected in her work as well. In addition to her role on The Project, she's also a co-founder of the charity organization Beanies 4 Brain Cancer, which she started after losing her husband to the disease. The organization is dedicated to raising funds and awareness for brain cancer research, and Bickmore often speaks publicly about the impact the disease has had on her and her family.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Making Time for Self-Care</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In addition to prioritizing family, Bickmore also makes time for self-care. She's been open about her struggles with anxiety and the importance of taking care of mental health, which she says has been especially challenging during the pandemic.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>To combat stress and anxiety, Bickmore has turned to exercise, daily meditation, and making time for hobbies like gardening. By prioritizing her own mental and physical well-being, she's able to better balance the demands of her career, family, and personal life.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Staying Authentic</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One of the reasons Bickmore has become such a beloved figure in Australia is her authenticity. She's not afraid to be vulnerable and share her struggles, whether it's with her mental health or the challenges of parenting. In fact, she often uses her platform to advocate for issues related to women's health and parenting.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>By staying true to herself and her values, Bickmore has not only built a successful career but also a loyal fan base. She's a reminder that success doesn't have to come at the cost of staying true to oneself.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, Carrie Bickmore's career and parenting journey serves as an inspiration for many. Her ability to prioritize her family while still achieving success in her career, making time for self-care, and staying authentic are all valuable lessons for anyone looking to find balance in their own life.</p>
