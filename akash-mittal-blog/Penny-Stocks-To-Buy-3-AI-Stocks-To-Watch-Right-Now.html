    <h2>The AI Stock That Made Me Rich Overnight</h2>
    <p>It was just another typical day at work when a friend of mine messaged me about an AI penny stock that he had been following. He told me that the company had just partnered with a major tech giant and that the stock was expected to soar in the coming weeks. At first, I was skeptical, but something inside me told me to take a chance.</p>
    <p>So I pulled out my phone, opened my stock trading app, and invested $100 in the AI company. The next day, I woke up to find that the stock had already jumped by 50%! By the end of the week, it had doubled, and by the end of the month, it had quadrupled. That $100 investment had turned into $400 overnight, and I was hooked on AI penny stocks.</p>
    <p>If you're looking to invest in the stock market and want to take a chance on some high-risk, high-reward AI stocks, here are 3 that you should watch right now:</p>
