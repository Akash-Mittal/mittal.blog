  <p>It was an ordinary day for a group of hikers in Turkey's Mount Kaz when they stumbled upon an unusual sight. A small fawn, only three weeks old, was lying alone in a field, abandoned by its mother. The hikers immediately took the fawn into their care and notified local wildlife authorities.</p>
  <p>The fawn was taken to a nearby wildlife rehabilitation center, where it was examined by veterinarians. Despite being malnourished and dehydrated, the fawn was in relatively good health. The veterinarians estimated that it had been separated from its mother for several days, and that its chances of survival were slim.</p>
  <p>But with careful attention and expert care, the fawn began to slowly regain its strength. It was fed a special diet of milk and baby food, and kept in a warm and safe enclosure. As it began to grow stronger, the fawn became more active and playful.</p>
  <p>After several weeks, the fawn was released back into the wild. The hikers who had found it returned to Mount Kaz to witness its release, and were overjoyed to see the fawn bound off into the forest, strong and healthy once again.</p>
