   <p>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 was one of the most highly anticipated movies of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and while it was a box office success and received generally positive reviews, many fans felt that the movie wasted one of its key characters: Adam Warlock. In this article, we'll take a closer look at why fans were disappointed with how the movie handled this character, and what could have been done differently.</p>
   <h2>The Introduction of Adam Warlock</h2>
   <p>Adam Warlock was first mentioned in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the post-credits scene of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2, which showed his creation by Ayesha, the leader of the Sovereign race. Fans were excited to see this iconic character make his debut in the MCU, and many speculated that he would play a major role in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 and possibly even other movies in the franchise.</p>
   <p>However, when Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 was released, fans were disappointed to find out that Adam Warlock was barely in the movie, and had no significant impact on the storyline. Instead, the movie focused on other characters such as Peter Quill/Star-Lord, Gamora, and Rocket Raccoon, leaving Adam Warlock as an afterthought.</p>
   <p>This was particularly frustrating for fans who were familiar with the comics, where Adam Warlock is a major player in the cosmic universe and has been involved in some of the biggest storylines. Many fans had hoped that the MCU would do justice to this beloved character and give him the spotlight he deserves, but unfortunately, that didn't happen in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3.</p>
   <h2>The Problem with Adam Warlock's Role</h2>
   <p>So, what went wrong with Adam Warlock's role in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3? There were several factors that contributed to why fans were disappointed with how the movie handled this character:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Lack of Screen Time:</strong> As mentioned earlier, Adam Warlock was barely in the movie, and had no significant impact on the storyline. This left fans feeling that his introduction was pointless, and that he was wasted as a character.</li>
    <li><strong>Poor Characterization:</strong> Even when he was on screen, Adam Warlock felt like a one-dimensional character with no personality or depth. Fans felt that he was just there to look cool, and that the movie didn't do enough to explore his backstory or motivations.</li>
    <li><strong>Missed Opportunities:</strong> The movie teased a possible conflict between Adam Warlock and the Guardians, but this storyline was never fully developed. Fans felt that this was a missed opportunity to explore the dynamic between these characters and create a compelling conflict.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>What Could Have Been Done Differently</h2>
   <p>So, how could Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 have done justice to Adam Warlock? Here are three things that the movie could have done differently:</p>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>Give Him More Screen Time:</strong> One of the biggest reasons why fans were disappointed with Adam Warlock's role in the movie was because he didn't have enough screen time. If the movie had given him more of a presence and fleshed out his character more, fans would have been more invested in his story.</li>
    <li><strong>Explore His Backstory:</strong> Another way to make Adam Warlock a more compelling character would have been to explore his backstory and motivations. This could have been done through flashbacks or dialogue, and would have given fans a better understanding of who he is and why he matters.</li>
    <li><strong>Create a Compelling Conflict:</strong> Finally, the movie should have focused more on the conflict between Adam Warlock and the Guardians. This could have been a great way to create tension and drama, and would have given Adam Warlock a more defined role in the movie.</li>
   </ol>
   <p>Overall, while Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 was a fun and enjoyable movie, it did waste Adam Warlock as a character. By giving him more screen time, fleshing out his character, and creating a compelling conflict, the movie could have done justice to this beloved character and made him a memorable part of the MCU.</p>
