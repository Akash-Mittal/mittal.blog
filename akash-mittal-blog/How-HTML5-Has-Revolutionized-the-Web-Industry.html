    <h2>An Interesting Story</h2>
    <p>In 2014, the Indian government launched a new website to facilitate passport applications online. However, the website was poorly designed, and users faced numerous issues while trying to submit their applications. The website used outdated technology and did not provide a user-friendly experience. The government then decided to revamp the website using HTML5. The new website was launched in 2017 and proved to be a huge success. It was fast, responsive, and provided a seamless user experience. The use of HTML5 made the website mobile-friendly, which was a significant improvement over the previous version.</p>
