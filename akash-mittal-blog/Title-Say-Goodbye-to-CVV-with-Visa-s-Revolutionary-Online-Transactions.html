  <p>It was a usual weekday morning in June when Sarah decided to order groceries online. However, the checkout process turned out to be a nightmare as she failed to remember the CVV of her debit card. After multiple failed attempts, Sarah had to resort to physical shopping, which was time-consuming and cumbersome. But what if Sarah could have completed the transaction without the CVV? This is precisely what Visa, in partnership with participating merchants, aims to achieve with its latest innovation.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Visa’s initiative to eliminate CVV from online transactions is a game-changer in the world of online payments. The new system enables a password-free and frictionless checkout experience. So, whether it is buying groceries, booking travel tickets, or shopping for fashion, Visa’s initiative makes online transactions stress-free, eliminating the need to recall a confusing combination of numbers.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In fact, Cognizant CEO, Ravi Kumar, has lauded Visa’s impressive innovation at a recent earnings call. According to Kumar, this will significantly benefit merchants and customers alike, streamlining the online shopping process, and boosting digital economy growth.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This partnership is beneficial not just to customers but also to merchants and businesses. It will help businesses increase conversions by minimizing the abandoned cart rate, resulting in better customer engagement. For instance, companies like Amazon and Walmart have already shown interest in Visa’s new system.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>With Visa’s strategy, online transactions are no longer restricted to the tech-savvy. Older generations can now shop online with ease, without worrying about remembering their CVV.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>However, there are concerns about the security of online transactions without the CVV. Fraudulent activities and cybercrime pose a significant threat to the digital payments industry. To counter these risks, Visa has implemented enhanced security measures, such as tokenization and biometric authentication, to ensure a secure and safe transaction process.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, Visa’s new system of CVV-free transactions is a revolutionary initiative that will simplify digital payments. It is a revolutionary step that will boost the confidence of customers and merchants in the digital payments industry, further fueling the growth of the digital economy.</p>
