    <li>In the race for Artificial Intelligence, Amazon has recently announced that it will be adding a new AI-powered search tool called ChatGPT.</li>
    <li>ChatGPT is an advanced machine learning model that creates human-like responses to natural language, making it easier for customers to search for what they need.</li>
    <li>With the addition of ChatGPT, Amazon will be joining the likes of Google and Microsoft in the competitive market of generative AI technology.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>In the world of online shopping, finding the right product can be a time-consuming and frustrating task. However, with the help of AI-powered search tools, customers can now easily and quickly narrow down their search and find what they need.</p>

    <li>Another study found that 65% of customers who used chatbots had a positive experience, while only 24% had a negative experience.</li>
