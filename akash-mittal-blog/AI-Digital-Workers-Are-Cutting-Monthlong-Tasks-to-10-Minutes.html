   <p>It's a common scenario within businesses: employees spending hours upon hours completing repetitive, mundane tasks that could be automated. Not only does this take a toll on employee morale, but it also takes away valuable time that could be spent on more important tasks.</p>
   <p>That's where AI digital workers come in. These intelligent software robots can complete these mind-numbing tasks in just a fraction of the time, freeing up employees for more important work.</p>
   <p>Take the financial industry for example. Many companies use AI digital workers to extract key data from financial statements, a task that used to take up to a month to complete. Now, with the help of these digital workers, the same task can be completed in just 10 minutes.</p>
   
   <ul>
    <li>Insurance claims processing used to take weeks to complete, but AI digital workers can now process them in just hours.</li>
