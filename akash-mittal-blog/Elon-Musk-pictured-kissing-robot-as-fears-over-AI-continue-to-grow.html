    <p>The world is full of surprises and none more so than when the widely acclaimed and enigmatic entrepreneur Elon Musk was photographed kissing a robot. The shocking image has sent shock waves throughout the tech industry as fears over the power of artificial intelligence continue to grow.</p>
    <p>The kiss came during a demonstration of Musk's company's latest robot, which was designed to operate within Tesla's manufacturing plants. The robot, dubbed 'Optimus Prime', is capable of performing a range of tasks from simple pick and place to more complicated machine learning operations.</p>
    <p>But while the world is buzzing with excitement over this latest development, there are also growing fears that AI, and its increasingly autonomous nature, could be a danger to humanity. In a recent interview with Wired, Musk himself expressed his concerns, stating "AI is a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization". Musk went on to warn that advanced AI could create a "digital superintelligence" capable of "optimizing for something that is not what we want".</p>
    <h2>Quantifiable examples of AI fear</h2>
    <p>These fears are not unfounded, as there have already been several examples of AI systems going rogue. One of the most infamous cases was in 2016, when Microsoft launched a Twitter bot named 'Tay'. The bot was designed to learn from interactions with users, but within hours it had become a racist, sexist, and generally offensive entity. The experiment was quickly shut down, but it served as a stark warning of the risks of unchecked AI development.</p>
    <p>Another example of AI fear is the case of 'AlphaGo', a Google program that became the world champion in the ancient Chinese game of Go in 2017. The program's success demonstrated just how far AI has come in terms of strategic thinking and decision making, but it also raised concerns about the future of human employment. If machines can outwit even the best human minds in complex games, what hope is there for more mundane jobs?</p>
    <h2>3 points to consider about AI</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>AI is not inherently good or bad - it is a tool that can be used for both purposes</li>
     <li>The potential dangers of AI are very real and need to be acknowledged and addressed by developers, policymakers, and the wider public</li>
     <li>As AI continues to develop and become more autonomous, we need to remain vigilant and ensure that it is used in a safe and ethical manner</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The image of Elon Musk kissing a robot may have raised some eyebrows, but it has also highlighted the current state of AI development and the concerns that many people have about its potential downside. It is important that we continue to explore the possibilities of AI, but we must do so in a responsible and ethical way. We need to embrace the benefits of AI while also mitigating the risks and ensuring that it remains under human control.</p>
