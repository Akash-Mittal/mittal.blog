   <h2>Story of Nvidia</h2>
   <p>Once upon a time, there was a little startup called Nvidia that was founded in 1993 by three young engineers. The company's first product was a graphics card that was designed specifically for the PC gaming market. Over the years, Nvidia has expanded its business into other areas, such as artificial intelligence, data centers, and self-driving cars. Today, Nvidia is one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world, with a market capitalization of over $500 billion.</p>
   <p>One of the reasons for Nvidia's success is its ability to stay ahead of the curve in emerging technologies. For example, Nvidia was one of the first companies to recognize the potential of artificial intelligence and began developing the hardware and software necessary to support it. As a result, Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are now used by some of the biggest companies in the world, such as Google and Amazon, to power their AI applications.</p>
   <p>In August of 2020, Nvidia announced its intention to acquire Arm, a leading supplier of chips for smartphones and other mobile devices, for $40 billion. The acquisition is still pending regulatory approval, but if it goes through, it could make Nvidia an even bigger player in the semiconductor industry.</p>
   
   <p>Here are some numbers that demonstrate the impact that Nvidia has had on the stock market:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>From January to December 2020, Nvidia's stock price rose from $239 to $533, an increase of 123%.</li>
    <li>Nvidia's revenue in the third quarter of 2020 was $4.73 billion, up 57% from the same quarter in 2019.</li>
    <li>Nvidia's net income in the third quarter of 2020 was $1.34 billion, up 49% from the same quarter in 2019.</li>
   </ul>

    <li><strong>Tesla:</strong> This electric car manufacturer is one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a market capitalization of over $800 billion. Tesla's stock price has risen dramatically in the past year, fueled in part by the company's success in China.</li>
