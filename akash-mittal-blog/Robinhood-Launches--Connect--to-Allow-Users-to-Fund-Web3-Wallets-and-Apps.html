   <p>Once upon a time, there was a popular investment app called Robinhood that allowed users to buy and sell stocks with zero fees. Over time, Robinhood expanded its offerings to include cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. But Robinhood did not stop there. On December 13, 2021, Robinhood announced the launch of 'Connect', a new feature that allows users to fund Web3 wallets and applications with their Robinhood balance.</p>
   <h2>Real Life Examples</h2>
   <p>With Connect, Robinhood users can now send their existing buying power to decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms like Uniswap and Aave, and decentralized applications (dApps) like Aavegotchi and Axie Infinity. This represents a major shift in the market as traditional centralized finance (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) merge.</p>
   <p>For instance, a Robinhood user who has invested in the cryptocurrency Ethereum can transfer their Pools tokens to a DeFi protocol such as Compound, earn interest on their investment, and still retain the value of their ETH.</p>
   <h2>Main Companies and Hyperlinks</h2>
   <p>Robinhood's launch of Connect is timely, given the current crypto market craze. The main companies involved in the launch are:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><a href="https://robinhood.com/">Robinhood</a>: The investment app that allows users to buy and sell stocks and cryptocurrencies with zero fees.</li>
    <li><a href="https://uniswap.org/">Uniswap</a>: The decentralized trading protocol that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies without intermediaries.</li>
    <li><a href="https://aave.com/">Aave</a>: The decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that allows users to earn interest on their cryptocurrency holdings.</li>
    <li><a href="https://aavegotchi.com/">Aavegotchi</a>: The DeFi-powered game that allows users to own and play with virtual creatures that are backed by real crypto assets.</li>
    <li><a href="https://axieinfinity.com/">Axie Infinity</a>: The blockchain game that allows users to breed, raise, and battle creatures called Axies.</li>
    <li><a href="https://compound.finance/">Compound</a>: The DeFi protocol that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies with interest.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion, Summary, and Critical Comments</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, Robinhood's launch of Connect is a game-changer in the world of finance. It allows users to access DeFi protocols and dApps with ease, and it bridges the gap between CeFi and DeFi. This will undoubtedly bring more users into the crypto space and increase adoption of Web3 technologies.</p>
   <p>However, some critical comments must be made. Robinhood has been criticized in the past for not allowing users to move their cryptocurrency holdings off the platform. Connect appears to be a step towards rectifying this issue, but it remains to be seen how transparent and trustworthy Robinhood will be in its handling of user funds.</p>
   <p>Overall, Connect is a promising development, and it will be interesting to see how other investment apps and exchanges respond to this new trend.</p>
