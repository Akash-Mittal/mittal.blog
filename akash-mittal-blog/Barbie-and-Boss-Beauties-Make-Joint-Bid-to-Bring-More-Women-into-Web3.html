  <h1>Barbie and Boss Beauties Make Joint Bid to Bring More Women into Web3</h1> <img src="images/Barbie-and-Boss-Beauties-Make-Joint-Bid-to-Bring-More-Women-into-Web3.jpeg" alt="+Barbie-and-Boss-Beauties-Make-Joint-Bid-to-Bring-More-Women-into-Web3+">
  <p>When Barbie met Boss Beauties, it was like two worlds collided.</p>
  <p>Barbie, the beloved doll, known for her fashion sense and charm, and Boss Beauties, an empowering organization that connects, empowers and educates women entrepreneurs, have teamed up to bring more women into Web3.</p>
  <p>In a recent announcement, the two groups revealed their plans to launch a joint campaign that would encourage more women to embrace the Web3 movement and take advantage of the opportunities it offers.</p>
  <p>Barbie, who has always been interested in tech, sees this partnership as a way to inspire the next generation of female tech innovators, while Boss Beauties believes that the Web3 movement offers limitless potential for women entrepreneurs.</p>
  
  <p>The numbers speak for themselves. According to a recent report by the World Economic Forum, women are significantly underrepresented in the tech industry. In the United States, only 26% of computing jobs are held by women, while in Europe, women make up just 17% of the tech workforce.</p>
  <p>In contrast, the Web3 industry is still in its early stages but has already shown more diversity. A recent survey found that nearly 40% of Web3 developers are women, and that number is expected to grow as more women are drawn to the opportunities presented by this new technology.</p>

Or consider Eva Beylin, the co-founder and CEO of DAOhaus, a decentralized organization that provides tools and resources for DAOs. These women are proof that the Web3 industry offers limitless potential for female entrepreneurs and innovators.</p>
