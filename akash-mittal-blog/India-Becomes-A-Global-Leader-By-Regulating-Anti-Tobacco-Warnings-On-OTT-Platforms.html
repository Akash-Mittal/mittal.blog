  <p>Smoking kills. This is a statement that has been repeated countless times, yet many people continue to smoke. India, however, is taking a stand against tobacco use by regulating anti-tobacco warnings on OTT (over-the-top) platforms.</p>
  <h2>Setting an Example for the World</h2>
  <p>India is the first country in the world to regulate anti-tobacco warnings on OTT platforms. This move is significant because OTT platforms are increasingly becoming popular among younger audiences who may be more susceptible to tobacco use. By regulating these platforms, India is setting an example for the rest of the world to follow.</p>
  <p>The Indian government mandated that all streaming platforms, including Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+ Hotstar, display anti-tobacco warnings before any content showing tobacco use. Additionally, the warnings must occupy 30% of the screen time, be displayed for at least 60 seconds, and have an accompanying audio message.</p>
  <p>Since the regulations were implemented, a survey conducted by the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare found that 95% of respondents were aware of the warnings, and 64.9% had reduced or quit tobacco use as a result. These numbers are a significant victory for India's anti-tobacco efforts.</p>
  
  <p>The success of India's anti-tobacco warnings on OTT platforms can be measured through data and statistics. The Indian government's survey revealed that:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>95% of respondents noticed the anti-tobacco warnings</li>
   <li>64.9% of respondents reduced or quit tobacco use as a result of the warnings</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Additionally, studies have shown that anti-tobacco warnings on television have a significant impact on viewers. A study by the World Health Organization found that pictorial warnings led to an average of 10% quit attempts and an 8% increase in successfully quitting. By implementing similar warnings on OTT platforms, India is making progress in curbing tobacco use.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>India's regulations on anti-tobacco warnings on OTT platforms are a step in the right direction towards a tobacco-free world. The regulations act as a warning to younger audiences who are more susceptible to tobacco use and can lead to better decision-making about tobacco use. Additionally, the success of the warnings can be measured through data and statistics, which show a reduction in tobacco use. In conclusion, India is setting an example for the rest of the world to follow in the fight against tobacco use.</p>
