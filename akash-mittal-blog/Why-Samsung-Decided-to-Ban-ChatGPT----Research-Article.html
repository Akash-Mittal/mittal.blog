    <p>In early 2021, a team of engineers at Samsung discovered a major issue with its proprietary code. They needed a quick solution to fix it as soon as possible. Instead of relying on traditional methods, they turned to a new and advanced technology called ChatGPT. ChatGPT is an AI-based chatbot that uses natural language processing and deep learning algorithms to generate human-like responses to various inputs. The team fed their proprietary code to ChatGPT, which analyzed it and generated a solution that fixed the issue within minutes. The engineers were ecstatic with the result, but Samsung's management was not. They banned ChatGPT from their systems, sparking a heated debate among tech enthusiasts and AI experts around the world.</p>
