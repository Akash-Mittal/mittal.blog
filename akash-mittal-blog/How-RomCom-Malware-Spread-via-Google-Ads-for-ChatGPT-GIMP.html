  <p>Last year, I was browsing the internet and came across a website for a photo editing software called ChatGPT GIMP. I clicked on the download button and within seconds, my computer was infected with malware. It was a frustrating experience that left me feeling violated and vulnerable. Little did I know, this was just the beginning of a widespread scam that targeted thousands of unsuspecting internet users.</p>
  <p>The malware, known as RomCom, spreads through Google Ads for ChatGPT GIMP by tricking users into downloading a fake software update. Once installed, the malware hijacks the victim's browser and displays unwanted pop-up ads, redirects them to malicious websites, and even steals their personal information. It's a nightmare scenario that affects not only individuals but also businesses, governments, and other organizations.</p>
  <p>A recent report by Bleeping Computer reveals the extent of the RomCom malware campaign. According to the report, over 500,000 users were exposed to the malware through Google Ads for ChatGPT GIMP in just one week. The hackers behind the campaign are believed to be from a well-organized criminal group based in Eastern Europe, with ties to other cybercrime syndicates.</p>
  <h2>Quantifiable examples</h2>
  <p>The RomCom malware campaign has caused significant financial losses and reputational damage to its victims. In one case, a small business lost over $50,000 in revenue due to the malware infecting its computers and stealing confidential client data. In another case, a government agency was forced to shut down its entire network for several days to prevent further damage from the malware.</p>
  <p>The RomCom malware also has a serious impact on user privacy. According to the Bleeping Computer report, the malware is capable of collecting sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card numbers.
