    <h3>The Story of AlphaGo</h3>
    <p>In 2016, a computer program called AlphaGo made history by defeating the world champion of Go, a complex ancient Chinese board game. The victory was a major milestone for artificial intelligence and showed just how far the technology has come in a relatively short amount of time.</p>
    <p>But the development of AlphaGo wasn't an overnight success. It was the result of years of research and experimentation by a team of dedicated scientists and engineers. And that's the thing about AI research - it never stops. Even after achieving a major breakthrough, there's always more to learn and discover.</p>

    <h3>The Importance of Continual Research</h3>
    <ol>
     <li>AI is still in its infancy. Despite the impressive advancements we've seen in recent years, there's still so much we don't know about the technology and how it will continue to develop.</li>
     <li>AI has the potential to change the world. From healthcare to transportation to education, there's no limit to the areas where AI can make an impact. But in order to fully realize that potential, we need to keep pushing the boundaries of what's possible.</li>
     <li>AI is constantly evolving. The algorithms and models we use today may be outdated in just a few years' time. Continued research is necessary in order to stay ahead of the curve and ensure that we're always utilizing the most advanced AI techniques available.</li>
    </ol>
