    <p>Imagine waking up in the middle of the night, consumed by anxiety and unable to calm down. Instead of tossing and turning, you reach for your phone and start a conversation with a chatbot. This may sound like science fiction, but for thousands of people, it's becoming a reality as AI-powered mental health apps become more accessible.</p>

    <h2>Real-life Examples</h2>
    <p>Woebot, an app that uses cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques to help people manage their mental health, has been downloaded more than a million times. Its effectiveness has been demonstrated in multiple clinical trials, and its creators say that its non-judgmental, always-available approach has helped many people overcome their fears and anxieties.</p>
    <p>Another platform, Wysa, offers a similar service, but adds a layer of emotional intelligence to its technology. It uses machine learning to recognize patterns in user behavior and emotions, and can provide personalized suggestions and exercises based on that data.</p>
