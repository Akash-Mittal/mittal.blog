   <p>Stories of identity theft and data breaches are abundant in today's internet age. While all web-based platforms collect standard user data such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, and credit card details, keeping the data secure is a major challenge. Thus, many companies have turned to Web3 for solutions, hoping that decentralized networks and blockchain technology will provide a secure environment for users.</p>
   <p>However, some companies are not waiting for Web3 to arrive; they are taking matters into their own hands by improving data privacy and enabling user rights. Two such companies are Substack and Inrupt.</p>
   <h2>Substack</h2>
   <p>Substack, an email newsletter platform that enables writers to publish and monetize their work, recently announced a set of new features to protect its users' data. The platform will provide an option to enable two-factor authentication to protect accounts from unauthorized access. Additionally, Substack is introducing a user data download feature, allowing users to export their data and use it in other applications. Lastly, Substack will add a privacy policy specifically designed for European users that is compliant with GDPR regulations.</p>
   <h2>Inrupt</h2>
   <p>Inrupt, the startup co-founded by World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee, is focused on creating a decentralized internet where users have complete control over their data. Their solution is the Solid platform, which is designed to allow users to store and manage personal data in a secure and private environment. Solid also contains a set of user-centric tools for sharing data selectively with apps and other entities. Inrupt is partnering with governments and corporations to develop and deploy Solid-based apps, including a UK National Health System app for monitoring Covid-19 symptoms.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Companies like Substack and Inrupt are demonstrating that data privacy and user rights can be protected even without Web3 technology.</li>
    <li>By enhancing existing platforms with features like two-factor authentication and user data download, companies can improve data privacy and user control.</li>
    <li>Creating decentralized platforms like Solid can provide a lasting solution to the problem of data privacy by giving users complete control over their own data.</li>
   </ol>
