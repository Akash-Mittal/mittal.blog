   <p>Picture this: You're walking into a typical brick-and-mortar bookstore, hoping to find a book on digital transformation. As you scan the shelves, an employee approaches you and asks if they can help you find anything in particular. You explain that you're interested in how companies are using technology to improve their business processes.</p>
   <p>The employee smiles and nods. "Ah yes, digital transformation. It's certainly a hot topic these days." They then proceed to guide you to a small corner at the back of the store, where they show you a few books on the subject.</p>
   <p>This scenario illustrates a fundamental truth about the current business landscape: digital transformation is no longer a buzzword, but a reality that companies must embrace in order to remain competitive. The COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated this trend, forcing businesses to adapt quickly to the new normal of remote work and online customer interactions.</p>
