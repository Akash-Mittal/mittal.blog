  <p></p>
  <p>The year was 2009, and with the release of Bitcoin, the world was introduced to a revolutionary technology that would change the way we interact with the internet. Blockchain technology, underlying the cryptocurrency, introduced a decentralized ledger system, enabling peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries. With this release, the very foundation of how we view the internet began to shift. The rise of Web3 is here, and it's a game-changer.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Web3 Stack Explained: Defining the Decentralized Landscape</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Web3 is not only about blockchain technology, but it encompasses technologies that power the decentralized web. The Web3 Stack comprises Blockchain, Storage, Messaging, Payment, and Identity. It's essential to understand each of them to appreciate their significance in powering the decentralized landscape.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Blockchain: Blockchain technology is a distributed ledger system that records every transaction on a decentralized network. It is the backbone of the Web3 Stack and enables decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and smart contracts.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Storage: The web2 stack relies mainly on centralized servers that store data. Web3 Stack, on the other hand, is decentralized, and the data is spread over many devices, providing more security and tamper-resistant storage. IPFS and Arweave are some popular decentralized storage systems.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Messaging: Messaging protocols allow users to communicate with each other without intermediaries. It is crucial to create decentralized applications without relying on centralized platforms. Matrix and Whisper are such messaging protocols.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Payment: Cryptocurrencies and stablecoins power decentralized payments, allowing users to transact directly without intermediaries. Payment protocols such as Lightning Network and Connext Network enable faster and cheaper transactions.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Identity: Decentralized identity is essential to the Web3 Stack's growth, providing more privacy, security, and control of personal data. Web3 wallets act as digital identities, enabling users to interact with decentralized applications.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p> Web3 Stack implementations</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>There is no better way to understand the Web3 Stack than to look at real-life use cases that power the decentralized landscape. Here are three quantifiable examples worth looking at.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>DeFi has revolutionized the financial industry by offering a decentralized alternative to traditional banking. TokenSet is a decentralized platform that enables the creation of smart portfolios with tokens. It allowed users to set a strategy for a portfolio consisting of digital assets without the need for intermediaries, providing users with greater control and flexibility.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Uniswap is another decentralized exchange that enables peer-to-peer trading and automated market-making. It allows users to trade ERC-20 tokens without the need for intermediaries or order books.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>NFTs are unique tokens that represent a specific asset. They can be used to represent anything, from digital art to in-game items. The NBA Top Shot is a platform that allows users to buy, sell, and trade NFTs, representing memorable NBA moments.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Decentraland is another example of an NFT project, which is a virtual world powered by blockchain technology. It allows users to own virtual real estate and create decentralized applications within the world. It's a perfect example of Web3 Stack powered by blockchain, identity, payments, and storage.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Decentralized Social Media</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Decentralized social media is gaining popularity due to concerns about privacy and data breaches. Platforms such as Minds, Steemit, and Mastodon enable users to interact with each other without intermediaries and provide more control over their data.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Minds is a decentralized social media platform that rewards users with cryptocurrency for creating and sharing content. Steemit is a blockchain-based platform that rewards content creators with cryptocurrency for their contributions. It's a perfect example of how Web3 Stack can power decentralized payments and storage.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Web3 Stack is becoming the norm in powering decentralized applications, enabling peer-to-peer transactions, and eliminating intermediaries.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Blockchain, Storage, Messaging, Payment, and Identity are the essential components of Web3 Stack that power the decentralized landscape.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Web3 Stack examples, such as DeFi, NFTs, and Decentralized Social Media, showcase the potential of decentralization and what it can bring to users' control and flexibility.</p>
