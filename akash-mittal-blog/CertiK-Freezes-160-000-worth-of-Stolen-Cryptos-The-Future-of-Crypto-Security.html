  <p>Introduction:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, with new security measures and protocols being developed and implemented regularly. However, cybercriminals remain active and continue to find ways to exploit the vulnerabilities of these digital assets. In this article, we will discuss how CertiK, a leading blockchain security company, recently helped freeze stolen cryptos worth $160,000 and how this incident highlights the importance of strong crypto security measures.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Story:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In January 2021, a group of hackers breached a cryptocurrency exchange, gaining access to private keys and stealing several types of digital assets, including Ethereum, Binance, and Tether. The hackers successfully transferred these assets to different wallets, leaving the exchange's security team scrambling for a solution. The exchange reached out to CertiK for help, and within hours, CertiK had identified and frozen the stolen cryptos. This outcome proved that CertiK's security measures are not only effective but also highly timely.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Real Life Examples:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>- In 2018, a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange called Zaif was hacked, resulting in the loss of $60 million worth of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Monacoin. The exchange later decided to sell its business to another company and compensate its users for their losses.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>- In 2020, Twitter accounts belonging to several high-profile figures, including Elon Musk and Barack Obama, were hacked, and scammers managed to steal more than $120,000 worth of Bitcoin via a fake giveaway scam.</p>
