  <h1><em>From Kargil To Kirana: How Nithin Kamath's Father In Law Became An Inspiration To Many</em></h1> <img src="images/From-Kargil-To-Kirana-Zerodha-s-Nithin-Kamath-Shares-Inspirational-Story-Of-Father-In-Law.jpeg" alt="+From-Kargil-To-Kirana-Zerodha-s-Nithin-Kamath-Shares-Inspirational-Story-Of-Father-In-Law+">
  <p>It was a usual Sunday morning, when Mr. Ramesh Kamath, a retired Indian Army veteran, visited his son-in-law Nithin Kamath, the founder of Zerodha, in Bangalore. Over the cup of tea, Nithin asked Mr. Kamath, how he managed his finances post-retirement.</p>
  <p>Mr. Kamath's reply left Nithin startled. He said, "My son, for the last 20 years of my service, my only finance goal was to save Rs. 880 every month, which got invested in Kisan Vikas Patra, and it became Rs. 10 lakh. I was ignorant of other investment avenues and their benefits. But, today's youth is well-informed, and you have the power to change their lives."</p>
  <p>Mr. Kamath's story of financial prudence and simplicity left a deep impact on Nithin. He realized that not everyone had access to financial literacy and simplified investment options. This led him to start Zerodha, India's first discount brokerage firm, that aimed to democratize finance for Indian investors.</p>
