  <p>It was a typical Wednesday morning with most Americans glued to their social media timelines when something unusual happened.

Good luck, Ron!"</p>

  <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
  <p>One personal anecdote that illustrates the impact of digital media on public perception is the story of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's meteoric rise to political stardom. AOC, as she is popularly known, went from being a relatively unknown bartender to becoming the youngest woman ever elected to Congress in just a few months. This was largely due to her savvy use of social media to engage with her constituents and promote her progressive policies.</p>
  <p>A case study that is worth examining is the impact of deepfake videos on public trust and civic discourse. In 2018, a deepfake video of former President Obama went viral, in which he appeared to be speaking words that he had not actually said. This video raised concerns about the rampant spread of fake news and manipulated media, undermining our ability to discern truth from fiction.</p>
