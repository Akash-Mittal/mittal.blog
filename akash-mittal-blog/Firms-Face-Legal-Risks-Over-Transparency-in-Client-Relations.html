    <h2 id="story">The Story</h2>
    <p>Imagine you are a client of a Wall Street research firm. You pay them a lot of money to provide you with accurate and insightful research about companies you are interested in investing in. You trust them to provide you with unbiased and transparent information. But what if they are not being transparent? What if they have conflicts of interest that they are not disclosing to you?</p>
    <h2 id="examples">Real Life Examples</h2>
    <p>There have been several examples of Wall Street research firms facing legal action over lack of transparency in client relations. One such example is the case of Citigroup, which agreed to pay a $15 million penalty to the SEC in 2018 to settle charges that it failed to disclose certain conflicts of interest to clients of its research unit. Another example is the case of Morgan Stanley, which paid a $10 million penalty in 2015 to settle charges that it failed to disclose conflicts of interest related to its stock research.</p>
