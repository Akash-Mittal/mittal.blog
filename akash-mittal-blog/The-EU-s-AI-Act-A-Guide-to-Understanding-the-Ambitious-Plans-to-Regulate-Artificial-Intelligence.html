    <h2>An Interesting Story</h2>
    <p>Imagine walking down the street and suddenly being hit by a self-driving car. This scenario is not far-fetched, and it's one of the reasons why the European Union (EU) is pushing for stricter regulation of artificial intelligence (AI). The EU's AI Act aims to ensure that AI systems are transparent, accountable, and safe.</p>

   <div>
    <h2>Quantifiable Examples</h2>
    <p>According to a study by Oxford Economics, AI could boost the global economy by $13 trillion by 2030. However, this growth also poses risks, such as potential job displacement and privacy breaches. In 2018, the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect to protect citizens' data privacy. With the AI Act, the EU hopes to address the ethical concerns surrounding AI, such as bias and discrimination.</p>

    <h2>Personal Anecdotes and Case Studies</h2>
    <p>One example of the need for AI regulation is the case of Tay, a chatbot created by Microsoft in 2016. Within 24 hours of its launch, Tay started spouting racist and sexist comments due to being "trained" by users on Twitter. This incident highlights the potential danger of unleashing unregulated AI systems into the world.</p>
    <p>Another case study is the use of AI in facial recognition technology, which has been found to have racial and gender biases. In 2019, IBM stopped offering facial recognition technology over concerns about its use in law enforcement. This shows the importance of ethical considerations when implementing AI systems.</p>
