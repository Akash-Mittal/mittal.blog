   <p>Deepfakes, a kind of AI-generated fake media that can show people doing or saying things they never did, are becoming more and more prevalent in the online world, raising concerns about their potential to disrupt, deceive, and manipulate.</p>
   <p>Despite the risks they pose, deepfakes are becoming harder and harder to detect as AI tools become more advanced, making it crucial for companies to develop efficient and reliable AI deepfake detectors.</p>
   
   <p>In 2019, a deepfake video surfaced online showing former US President Barack Obama delivering a speech that he never gave. The video was created by Jordan Peele, a comedian and filmmaker, to raise awareness about the dangers of deepfakes.</p>
   <p>The video went viral, sparking a debate on the ethics and potential consequences of deepfakes, and highlighting the need for effective deepfake detection tools.</p>
   
   <ul>
    <li>According to a study by Deeptrace, a company that specializes in detecting deepfakes, the number of deepfake videos online has grown by 330% since October 2019, with 96% of them being pornographic in nature.</li>
    <li>In 2020, an AI deepfake detector developed by Facebook and Microsoft was able to detect 65% of deepfake videos, up from just 26% in 2019.</li>
    <li>A company called Sensity, which specializes in detecting deepfake videos, has identified over 50,000 deepfake videos online since 2019.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>12 Companies Racing to Create AI Deepfake Detectors</h2>
   <p>Here are 12 companies that are at the forefront of the race to create reliable and effective AI deepfake detectors:</p>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>Microsoft:</strong> Working on an AI deepfake detector that can analyze facial movements and voice patterns to determine if a video is real or fake.</li>
    <li><strong>Facebook:</strong> Collaborating with universities and other companies to create more advanced AI deepfake detectors.</li>
    <li><strong>Sensity:</strong> Specializes in detecting deepfakes and has developed a deepfake detection tool called Reality Defender.</li>
    <li><strong>Dessa:</strong> Developed an AI-powered deepfake detector called Sherlock that can detect deepfakes in real-time.</li>
    <li><strong>Amperity:</strong> Using AI and machine learning to create deepfake detection models that can detect even the most advanced deepfakes.</li>
    <li><strong>Truepic:</strong> Creating an AI-powered platform called Truepic Vision that can verify the authenticity of photos and videos in real-time.</li>
    <li><strong>AI Foundation:</strong> Developing an AI deepfake detector called Reality Defender that can detect deepfakes with high accuracy.</li>
    <li><strong>Google:</strong> Working on several deepfake detection projects, including an AI algorithm that can analyze facial movements and determine if a video is real or fake.</li>
    <li><strong>Blackbird.AI:</strong> Using machine learning and natural language processing to detect deepfake videos and combat disinformation online.</li>
    <li><strong>Cognitivescale:</strong> Developing an AI deepfake detection tool called Amplified Intelligence that can analyze videos in real-time and detect even the most convincing deepfakes.</li>
    <li><strong>Intel:</strong> Collaborating with universities and other companies to develop more advanced AI deepfake detection tools and technologies.</li>
    <li><strong>Picsart:</strong> Using AI and machine learning to create deepfake detection models that can detect even the most sophisticated deepfakes.</li>
   </ol>
