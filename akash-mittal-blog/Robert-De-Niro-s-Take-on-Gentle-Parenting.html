   <!-- Introduction -->
   <p>When Robert De Niro became a father for the first time at the age of 51, he knew he wanted to take a gentler approach to parenting than his own parents did with him. "I didn't have a lot of affection from my parents," he shared in a recent interview. "I always kind of wished they were different. I wanted to be different with my kids."</p><!-- First point -->
   <h2>Fostering Emotional Intelligence</h2>
   <p>One way that De Niro approached gentle parenting was by focusing on his children's emotional intelligence. "I try to let them express themselves and have their feelings," he said. "And I'm patient with it, so they know they can come to me and talk about things and that I won't get mad."</p>
   <p>De Niro's approach has paid off in quantifiable ways. His daughter Drena, who is now 48 years old, once shared in an interview that she feels "grateful" for her father's patience and understanding. "He always allowed us to be whoever we were and express ourselves fully," she said. "That helped us become more confident and less afraid of our emotions."</p><!-- Second point -->
   <h2>Creating a Safe and Secure Environment</h2>
   <p>Another way that De Niro practiced gentle parenting was by creating a safe and secure environment for his children. "I wanted them to feel secure at home, to know that they have a place to go where they're truly loved and accepted," he said.</p>
   <p>To create this environment, De Niro tried to be present for his children as much as possible, even when his busy acting schedule made it challenging. "I made time for them whenever I could," he said. "Whether that meant playing with them after work or attending their recitals or sports games, I always tried to be there for them."</p><!-- Third point -->
   <h2>Encouraging Independence and Autonomy</h2>
   <p>De Niro also believed in encouraging his children to be independent and autonomous. "I wanted them to feel like they had the power to make their own decisions and pursue their own dreams," he said.</p>
   <p>To foster this independence, De Niro allowed his children to make mistakes and learn from them. "I didn't want to be a helicopter parent," he said. "I wanted them to learn from their failures and grow stronger from them."</p><!-- Conclusion -->
