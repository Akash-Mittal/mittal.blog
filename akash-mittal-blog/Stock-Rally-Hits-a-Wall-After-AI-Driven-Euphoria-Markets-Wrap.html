  <p>Joe, a 35-year-old banker, had invested a significant part of his savings in a tech company that had been making news for its artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The company's stock had been on a steady upward trend, and Joe had been confident that it would continue to rise. However, in the last few weeks, things had taken a turn for the worse. The stock had hit a wall and was now on a downward spiral. As Joe watched his investment dwindle, he couldn't help but wonder what had caused this sudden change in fortune.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The answer, as it turned out, lay in the euphoria that had gripped the markets regarding AI-driven technologies. It seemed as though everyone had jumped on the bandwagon, investing heavily in companies that promised to revolutionize the world with their smart machines. However, as is often the case with such hype-driven markets, the reality turned out to be different. Investors were now realizing that AI technologies were still in their infancy and that the promised returns were still a long way off. The result: the stock prices of these companies were plummeting, causing investors like Joe to suffer heavy losses.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable Examples</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The rise and fall of AI-driven stocks is not just a personal story, but one that can be quantified by the market. In the last year, the Nasdaq index, which is heavily weighted towards tech stocks, has seen a sharp surge in prices. At its peak, the Nasdaq was up by over 40% from its pre-pandemic levels, largely driven by companies focusing on AI and other cutting-edge technologies. However, in the last few weeks, the Nasdaq has taken a sharp turn, losing around 4% in just three days.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The slide in the stock prices of companies focusing on AI-driven technologies has also been pronounced. For instance, the shares of ZoomInfo, a technology company that provides AI-powered contact data, fell by 9% in a single day, wiping out over $1 billion in market value. Similarly, the stock of Palantir, a data analytics company that uses AI to process large amounts of information, has lost nearly 18% of its value in just a few weeks.</p>

  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusions in 3 points</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The hype around AI-driven technologies has driven the market to overvalue companies that use such technologies. This has led to a sharp increase and then decline in the stock prices of companies concentrating on AI.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Investors must realize that AI technologies are as-yet unproven and that the promised returns are still distant. Careful investment analysis is necessary to separate realistic investments and those led by hype.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>A balanced investment portfolio, which includes a mix of AI-driven and other technologies, particularly in a post-pandemic age, is vital to protect investor confidence.</p>
