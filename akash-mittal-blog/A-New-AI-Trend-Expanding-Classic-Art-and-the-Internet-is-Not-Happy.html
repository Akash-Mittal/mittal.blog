    <p>Imagine seeing a beautiful piece of art at a museum and feeling awe-inspired by the talent, creativity, and detail that went into its creation. And then imagine seeing that same piece of art being distorted, manipulated, and changed by an AI program to create something entirely new and different. This is the reality of a new AI trend that is expanding classic art - and the internet is not happy about it.</p>

    <h2>The Quantifiable Examples</h2>
    <p>Many artists and art enthusiasts are worried about this trend because it disrespects the original artist's vision and intent. Computer algorithms are essentially taking the work of a master artist and turning it into something unrecognizable and potentially meaningless.</p>
    <p>One example of this is the recent AI-generated portrait of a fictional aristocrat named Edmond de Belamy. The original image was created by artist Ian Goodfellow using a GAN (generative adversarial network) algorithm. The painting ended up selling for over $400,000 at Christie's auction house, which is a testament to the growing interest in AI-generated art.</p>
    <p>Another example is the AI-generated version of Leonardo da Vinci's famous Mona Lisa painting that was created by developer Nathan Shipley. The AI was able to manipulate the colors and textures of the original painting to create a surreal, dream-like version that some found intriguing but ultimately disrespectful.</p>
    <p>These examples may seem harmless at first, but they are indicative of a larger trend that could have negative implications for the art world as a whole.</p>

     <li>AI-generated art is becoming more prevalent and is disrupting traditional notions of what constitutes "real" art.</li>
     <li>Many artists and art enthusiasts are concerned about this trend because it can be viewed as disrespectful to the original artist's vision and intent.</li>
     <li>It is important for the art community to have open and honest conversations about the role of AI in art and to establish guidelines for how it should be used in a way that respects the integrity and creativity of the original artist.</li>

    <h2> and Practical Tips</h2>
    <p>As an aspiring artist myself, I understand the importance of respecting the work of those who came before me and using their art as inspiration to create something new and unique. However, I also see the potential benefits of using AI to expand on classic art in a way that breathes new life into it and makes it more accessible to a wider audience.</p>
    <p>One practical tip for using AI in art is to always give credit to the original artist and acknowledge the role that AI played in the creation of the new piece. This can help to minimize the perception that the AI-generated art is somehow more valuable or important than the original work.</p>
