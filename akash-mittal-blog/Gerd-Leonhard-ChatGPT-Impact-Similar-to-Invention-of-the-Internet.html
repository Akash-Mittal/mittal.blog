    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>It was the year 1989, when a British computer scientist named Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. This invention revolutionized the world of communication, bringing people closer together and allowing them to share information like never before.</p>
    <p>Today, in the year 2021, another revolutionary technology is changing the way we communicate, work, and live. This technology is called ChatGPT, and it's the brainchild of German futurist Gerd Leonhard.</p>
    <p>ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence-based chatbot that can converse with humans on a wide range of topics, from news and current affairs to personal relationships and emotions. It uses advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to analyze human language and respond with empathy and understanding.</p>
    <p>According to Leonhard, ChatGPT is not just another chatbot. It's an entirely new way of communicating that can transform the way we work, think, and interact with the world around us.</p>
