  <h1>The Rise of Blockchain Games: Gods Unchained Goes Mobile on Apple and Android</h1> <img src="images/Apple-Android-to-get-Mobile-Version-of-Web3-Game-Gods-Unchained.jpeg" alt="+Apple-Android-to-get-Mobile-Version-of-Web3-Game-Gods-Unchained+">
  <p>Have you ever heard of the term "web3" or "blockchain games"? If not, you're about to enter the exciting world of decentralized gaming, where players have true ownership over their assets and the gaming experience is more transparent and fair. And now, one of the most popular blockchain games, <b>Gods Unchained</b>, is coming to the mobile platforms of Apple and Android.</p>
  <h2>The Story of Gods Unchained</h2>
  <p>Gods Unchained is a digital collectible card game that is built on the Ethereum blockchain, which is known for its smart contract capabilities and decentralized applications. The game is inspired by classic trading card games like Magic: The Gathering, but with a modern twist. Players can purchase and trade their digital cards on the blockchain, which means that they own and control them outside of the game.</p>
  <p>The game's developers, Immutable, launched a crowdfunding campaign in 2018 to kickstart the development of the game, which raised over $15 million. Since then, the game has gained a cult following in the blockchain community, with tournaments and championships offering thousands of dollars in prizes.</p>
  <h2>Why the Mobile Version is a Game Changer</h2>
  <p>Up until now, Gods Unchained has only been available on desktops, which limits its accessibility and audience. However, with the release of the mobile version, the game can reach a wider audience, including casual gamers who prefer mobile devices.</p>
  <p>According to a report by Newzoo, the global mobile gaming market generated $77.2 billion in revenue in 2020, with over 2.4 billion gamers worldwide. By launching on mobile platforms, Gods Unchained can tap into this massive market and potentially become a mainstream game.</p>
  <h2> Blockchain Game's Popularity</h2>
  <p>It's not just Gods Unchained that's gaining popularity in the blockchain gaming space. Other games like Axie Infinity, The Sandbox, and Decentraland are also making waves. Axie Infinity, another blockchain-based game, has become so popular that it's now the top-grossing decentralized application (dApp) on the Ethereum network, surpassing even Uniswap and Compound. The game has also created a new job market, with players earning cryptocurrency by playing the game and selling their virtual creatures.</p>
  <p>The Sandbox, a virtual world game, has sold over $1.5 million worth of virtual land, with each parcel of land being a non-fungible token (NFT) on the blockchain. This shows the potential of blockchain games not just as games, but as investment opportunities and digital real estate.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion: The Future of Blockchain Gaming</h2>
  <p>Blockchain gaming is still in its early stages, but it's already showing immense potential for creating new gaming experiences and business models. By combining blockchain technology with gaming, players can truly own and control their assets, which creates a more fair and transparent gaming environment.</p>
  <p>The launch of Gods Unchained on Apple and Android is a big step towards mainstream adoption of blockchain games. With the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and decentralized finance (DeFi), it's only a matter of time before more players discover the benefits of blockchain gaming.</p>
  <p>So, get ready to enter the new era of gaming and see what the future holds.</p>
