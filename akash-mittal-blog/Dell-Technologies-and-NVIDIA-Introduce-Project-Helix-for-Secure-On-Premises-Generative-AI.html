    <p>Imagine a world where a computer system could come up with brand new ideas and solutions to everyday problems. Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly evolving towards this reality. However, with the ability to create endless new possibilities comes the very real concern that sensitive data could be compromised in the process - and that's not even getting into the possibility of rogue AI creating unprecedented risks we can't even anticipate. To be successful with generative AI means being absolutely sure your data is safe from the ground up. That's where Dell Technologies and NVIDIA steps in with Project Helix.</p>

   <section>
    <h2>What is Project Helix?</h2>
    <p>Dell Technologies and NVIDIA have collaborated on a new project to enable on-premises generative AI leveraging the secured technologies. Project Helix provides unprecedented data security to ensure that the generative process takes place within a secure environment. With the help of NVIDIA's computing power and Dell's security innovations, Project Helix's results are achieved through extensive testing and validation before being released to the public.</p>

   <section>
    <h2>Benefits of Project Helix</h2>
    <p>Project Helix provides several benefits, including:</p>
    <ul>
     <li><strong>Secure Data Management:</strong> Project Helix ensures that your sensitive data stays behind a secure wall to protect it from potential breaches.</li>
     <li><strong>Quicker Deployment:</strong> By providing pre-validated platform infrastructure components, Project Helix helps organizations reduce the time they need to deploy generative AI and enables them to get started faster.</li>
     <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Project Helix is a turnkey solution, and its features are elegantly integrated, allowing organizations to take advantage of generative AI without worrying about infrastructure or technical expertise.</li>
    </ul>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>How Project Helix Works</h2>
    <p>Project Helix works by combining the power of Dell Technologies for secure on-premises compute infrastructure with NVIDIA's hardware acceleration through GPUs and software development expertise. Their solution is built on a range of NVIDIA technologies including Quadro RTX GPUs and NVIDIA DGX, as well as NVIDIA's AI software stack. The GPUs are vital to the acceleration of generative AI, without which, the process would be much slower, less efficient and more expensive.</p>
    <p>This collaboration allows Project Helix to offer a secure and validated alternative to taking your generative AI to the cloud. However, being secure doesn't mean you sacrifice performance. Project Helix has been optimized to deliver maximum throughput for deep learning deployments, making it one of the fastest on the market.</p>

    <h2> Project Helix</h2>
    <p>The benefit of Project Helix is obvious, but what sort of returns can organizations really expect? Here are some quantifiable examples.</p>
    <ul>
     <li><strong>Reduced Costs:</strong> With the efficient use of resources, Project Helix customers can expect to reduce training times on deep learning models by an average of 70%.</li>
     <li><strong>Increased Accuracy:</strong> Project Helix has been designed with a view to improving accuracy in generative output by as much as 20% when compared to alternative systems.</li>
     <li><strong>Improved Performance:</strong> Project Helix can process as many as three times the number of images per second when compared to other systems, making it one of the fastest on the market.</li>
    </ul>
