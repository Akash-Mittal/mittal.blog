   <h2>How AI is changing the way we look at images.</h2>

  <main>
   <p>Imagine you're scrolling through your social media feed and you come across a beautiful landscape photograph. It looks almost too good to be true – crystal clear waters, blue skies, and green mountains as far as the eye can see. But then you notice something strange – the shadows don't quite match up, and some of the elements in the photo seem to be repeating. You start to wonder: is this photo real, or was it generated by AI?</p>
   <p>It's a question that's becoming increasingly difficult to answer, as AI-generated images are becoming more and more advanced.</p>
   <h3>The rise of AI-generated images</h3>
   <p>Artificial intelligence has come a long way in recent years, and now it's making waves in the world of photography. AI-generated images are so realistic that it's often impossible to tell whether they're real or not.</p>
   <p>One example of this is the website <a href="https://generated.photos/">Generated Photos</a>, which claims to offer "a diverse library of AI-generated faces" that can be used for various purposes, such as advertising, gaming, or design. The faces look completely real, but in fact, they were all generated by AI.</p>
   <p>Another example is the research project <a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/">This Person Does Not Exist</a>, which uses a machine learning algorithm to create portraits of people that don't actually exist. The results are so convincing that it's hard to believe they're not real photographs.</p>
   <h3>The advantages and drawbacks of AI-generated images</h3>
   <p>There are undoubtedly some advantages to using AI-generated images. For one thing, they can save time and money compared to hiring a professional photographer or model. In addition, they can be used for a wide range of purposes without the need for model releases or copyright issues.</p>
   <p>However, there are also some potential drawbacks. For one thing, if AI-generated images become too widespread, it could undermine the value of genuine photographs. In addition, there's the question of bias – if AI is being used to generate images of people, for example, there's a risk that it could perpetuate harmful stereotypes or exclude certain groups.</p>
   <h3>The future of AI-generated images</h3>
   <p>So what does the future hold for AI-generated images? Will we soon be unable to distinguish between real and fake photographs?</p>
   <p>It's certainly a possibility. As AI technology continues to evolve, it's likely that we'll see more and more sophisticated image generation techniques emerge. And as these images become more pervasive, it will become increasingly difficult to tell what's real and what's not.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>AI-generated images are becoming more and more realistic, to the point where it's often impossible to tell whether they're real or not.</li>
    <li>There are advantages to using AI-generated images, such as saving time and money, but also potential drawbacks, such as the risk of perpetuating harmful stereotypes.</li>
    <li>The future of AI-generated images is uncertain, but it's likely that we'll see more and more sophisticated techniques emerge in the coming years.</li>
