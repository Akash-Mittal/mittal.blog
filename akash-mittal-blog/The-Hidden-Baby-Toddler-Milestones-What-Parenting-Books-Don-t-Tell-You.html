    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>It was a sunny day, and I was taking my 14-month-old daughter to the park. She was running around and putting sand in her mouth every time I turned my back. Suddenly, she stopped, looked at the sky and said, "Bird!" That was the first time she had identified a bird, and I was amazed. It was a small but significant milestone that I wasn't expecting. It made me wonder, what other hidden baby toddler milestones are there that parenting books don't tell us about?</p>

   <section id="examples">
    
    <ul>
     <li>Recognizing colors and shapes</li>
     <li>Self-soothing and falling asleep independently</li>
     <li>Giving precise directions using body language or gestures</li>
     <li>Engaging in imaginative play with toys or household objects</li>
     <li>Being able to follow simple two-step instructions</li>
     <li>Showing empathy by hugging or comforting others</li>
     <li>Using potty words or body signals to indicate need for a diaper change</li>
     <li>Showcasing a sense of humor by understanding and laughing at jokes</li>
     <li>Talking about things not present in the moment, like events from the past or plans for the future</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These milestones don't always occur at the same time for every child, and some may occur earlier or later than expected. However, they are all signs of healthy development and growth.</p>

    <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
    <h3>1. Observe and Encourage</h3>
    <p>Observe your child's behavior and encourage them to try new things. Be present and engaged in their playtime, offer gentle praise and encouragement when you see them testing new skills, and avoid being overly critical or discouraging.</p>
    <h3>2. Promote Autonomy</h3>
    <p>Let your child make choices and decisions when appropriate. This promotes independence and encourages them to trust their own judgment and abilities.</p>
    <h3>3. Play and Learn</h3>
    <p>Use playtime as an opportunity for learning and development. Choose toys and activities that promote problem-solving, creativity and logical thinking.</p>
