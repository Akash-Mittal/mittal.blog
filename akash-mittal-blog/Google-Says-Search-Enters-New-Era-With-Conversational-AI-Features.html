    <h2>A Personal Story to Start With</h2>
    <p>As a person who uses the internet every day, I have seen how search engines have changed over time. I remember the days when I had to type in specific keywords to get the results I needed. But now, thanks to Google's conversational AI features, I can simply ask Google a question as if I were talking to a friend and get instant answers.</p>

    <h2>Quantifiable Examples</h2>
    <p>According to Google, over 70% of search queries are now in natural language form instead of specific keywords. This shows that people are increasingly comfortable with using conversational language to communicate with search engines. Additionally, Google's BERT algorithm, which uses natural language processing to better understand search queries, has improved the accuracy of search results by 10%. This means that users are more likely to find exactly what they are looking for in their search results.</p>
