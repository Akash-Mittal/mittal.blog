   <p>In 2007, NVIDIA, the well-known graphics processing unit (GPU) manufacturer, tried to move into the mobile phone market. However, the competition was fierce, and the company struggled to make much headway.</p>
   <p>Undeterred, NVIDIA started to pivot its focus towards the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence (AI). The company saw an opportunity to use its powerful GPUs to accelerate the training of AI algorithms, and began to invest heavily in this area.</p>
   <p>Now, over a decade later, NVIDIA's bet has paid off big time. The company is one of the world's leading suppliers of GPUs for AI, and its stock has soared on the back of strong demand for related products and services.</p>
   
   <p>According to recent financial reports, NVIDIA's Q1 2021 earnings were $3.08 billion, up 39% from the same quarter in the previous year. The company's gross margin also improved, from 63.8% in Q1 2020 to 65.1% in Q1 2021.</p>
   <p>One major driver of these results is the increasing demand for AI-related products and services. NVIDIA's GPUs are used by many companies to train and run AI algorithms, and as more businesses look to harness the power of AI, demand for these GPUs is only likely to increase.</p>
   <p>Another example of NVIDIA's success in the AI space is its recent partnership with Mercedes-Benz. The automaker is using NVIDIA's AI technology to power its advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and other car manufacturers are likely to follow suit.</p>
   <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
