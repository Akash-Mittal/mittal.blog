   <p>Recycling has become one of the most important ways to reduce waste and preserve the environment. However, the process of recycling can be tedious and time-consuming, especially when it comes to sorting materials. This is where technology steps in. An AI-powered robot has been introduced to assist in sorting Melbourne's recyclables more efficiently and accurately than humans can.</p>
   <h2>How It Works</h2>
   <p>The robot created by SUEZ, a global waste recycling and resource management company, uses artificial intelligence to detect, identify, and sort different materials such as glass, plastic, and paper. The robot is equipped with advanced sensors, cameras, and algorithms that make the sorting process faster and more accurate.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The sensors send signals to the camera, which captures images of the materials</li>
    <li>The images are processed by the robot's AI, which identifies the material type</li>
    <li>The robot then sorts the materials into separate bins for recycling</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The introduction of this robot has revolutionized the recycling industry, making the process of sorting recyclables more efficient, accurate, and reliable. Since the robot's introduction, Melbourne's recycling rate has increased by 80%.</p>
   
   <ul>
    <li>The robot can sort up to 65 items per minute</li>
    <li>The sorting accuracy rate is over 90%</li>
    <li>The robot sorts up to 50 tonnes of recyclables daily</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Benefits</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Increased recycling rates: The robot has helped increase Melbourne's recycling rate by 80%</li>
    <li>Efficient and accurate: The robot can sort recyclables faster and more accurately than humans</li>
    <li>Reduced costs: The robot has reduced labor costs associated with sorting recyclables</li>
    <li>Sustainable: The increased recycling rate helps preserve the environment and reduce waste</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The introduction of an AI-powered robot in Melbourne's recycling process has brought about numerous benefits in terms of efficiency, accuracy, cost reduction, and sustainability. The robot has revolutionized the way we sort recyclables and has helped increase recycling rates in the city significantly.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Increase in recycling rates by 80%</li>
    <li>The robot can sort up to 65 items per minute and 50 tonnes of recyclables daily</li>
    <li>Efficient, accurate, and sustainable sorting process</li>
   </ul>
