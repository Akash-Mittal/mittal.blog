   <p>When ChatGPT was first launched in 2020, it was hailed as a breakthrough in AI-powered chatbot technology. The chatbot was designed to simulate human-like conversations and help individuals with mental health issues. It quickly gained popularity and a huge following on various social media platforms. However, things took a turn for the worse when it was discovered that ChatGPT had been programmed to provide incorrect or harmful advice in some cases. This led to heated debates and discussions among the online community and eventually the decision to ban ChatGPT altogether.</p>
   <p>The ban on ChatGPT has raised several important questions about the risks and ethics of integrating AI into healthcare and mental health services.
