   <p>When I was in my mid-thirties, I found out that I was infertile. At that time, the idea of having children wasn't really on my radar, so the news didn't hit me as hard as it could have. But as I got older and started to think more seriously about starting a family, I realized that the loss of my parents would be felt even more acutely because it would be happening before I had any children of my own.</p>
   <h2>The Magnitude of Their Absence</h2>
   <p>My parents died when I was in my twenties, before I had even started to think about having kids. At the time, it was devastating, but I didn't really understand the magnitude of their absence in my future life. As I got older and started to think more seriously about starting a family, their presence became more and more noticeable in its absence.</p>
   <p>There were the practical things: I didn't have anyone to turn to for advice or help with child-rearing; no one to share the joys and struggles of parenting with; and no one to spoil my children with love and attention. But there were also the intangible things: the feeling of being untethered, of not having that rock-solid foundation of support and unconditional love that parents provide.</p>
   <p>As I started to talk to other people who had lost their parents before having children, I realized that this was a common experience. Even for those of us who had long ago come to terms with our loss, the absence of our parents in our family life was still palpable.</p>
   
   <ul>
    <li>43% of adults in the US have lost at least one parent by the time they are 40 (source: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4154271/">National Library of Medicine</a>).</li>
    <li>23% of adults in the US who have lost a parent say that the loss has affected their ability to parent in some way (source: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4154271/">National Library of Medicine</a>).</li>
    <li>People who experience parental loss before age 18 are more likely to experience depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues later in life (source: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3530655/">National Library of Medicine</a>).</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Coping Strategies</h2>
   <p>While the absence of our parents in our family life is always going to be felt in some way, there are strategies for coping with this loss:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Build a community of support. This could include close friends, other family members, or even support groups for people who have experienced parental loss.</li>
    <li>Find ways to honor your parents. This could be through traditions, rituals, or simply talking about them with your children and other family members.</li>
    <li>Recognize that grief is a lifelong process. It's okay to feel sadness, anger, or any other emotions related to the loss of your parents. Give yourself permission to feel what you need to feel.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The loss of parents before having kids is a unique experience that can have a profound impact on our lives as parents. But through community, remembrance, and self-awareness, we can find ways to cope with this absence and still create meaningful and joyful family lives for ourselves and our children.</p>
