   <p>It was a hot summer day in Abidjan, the economic capital of Ivory Coast. The streets were bustling with people, cars, and market vendors selling everything from fruits to electronics. In one of the busiest streets, a group of French businessmen were negotiating a new oil deal with the Ivorian government representatives. The negotiations have been going on for weeks, and both parties were eager to finalize the agreement. The French had a lot at stake; they wanted to secure their access to Ivory Coast's offshore oil reserves, which were estimated to be worth billions of dollars. On the other hand, the Ivorians were hesitant about giving away their resources to foreign entities, especially after years of exploitation by Western powers.</p>
   <p>The negotiations reached a critical point when one of the Ivorian representatives raised concerns about the environmental impact of oil drilling on the country's fragile ecosystem. The French businessmen tried to reassure him that they would comply with all environmental standards and regulations, but the Ivorians were not convinced. Suddenly, an unexpected voice spoke up. It was a young French woman, who had been silently observing the negotiations. She was an environmental lawyer, who had been working with the Ivorian government on a new set of environmental laws and regulations. She stepped forward and offered to help the Ivorians to draft a contract that would protect the country's natural resources and biodiversity. Her offer was accepted, and the negotiations resumed. A few days later, the deal was signed, and both parties were satisfied.</p>
   <p>This incident is a clear example of France's new approach to expand its geopolitical influence in Africa. Instead of relying solely on economic and military power, France is now trying to adopt a more collaborative and sustainable approach that takes into account the interests of African nations. This new strategy has been dubbed "AFRICA 2020" and is part of the French government's efforts to renew its relationship with the continent.</p>

   <p>As a French expat living in Senegal, I have witnessed firsthand the positive impact of France's new approach on the continent. I have met many young African entrepreneurs who have benefited from French support and mentorship programs. I have also seen how French companies are investing in renewable energy and sustainable agriculture, creating jobs and reducing poverty. At the same time, I have seen how French cultural institutions, such as the Institut Français, are promoting cultural exchange and dialogue between France and Africa. Overall, I believe that France's new approach is a step in the right direction, and I hope that other Western powers will follow suit.</p>
