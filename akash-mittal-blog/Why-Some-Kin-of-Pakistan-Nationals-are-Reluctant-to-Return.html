  <h1>Why Some Kin of Pakistan Nationals are Reluctant to Return?</h1> <img src="images/Why-Some-Kin-of-Pakistan-Nationals-are-Reluctant-to-Return.jpeg" alt="+Why-Some-Kin-of-Pakistan-Nationals-are-Reluctant-to-Return+">
  <p>Many Pakistan nationals have family members or close relatives living abroad. While many of them dream of reuniting with their loved ones, there are some who are reluctant to return. This reluctance can be caused by a variety of factors, including political, social, and economic challenges in Pakistan.</p>
  
  <p>Ali is a Pakistani who has been living in the United States for the past ten years. His parents, siblings, and extended family still reside in Pakistan. While Ali misses his family dearly, he has no intentions of returning to his homeland anytime soon. The reason for this is simple â€“ he does not feel safe in Pakistan.</p>
  <p>According to Ali, the political situation in Pakistan is extremely volatile, and there is a constant threat of violence. He fears that if he returns to Pakistan, he may become a victim of terrorism or targeted killings. Therefore, he feels that it is safer for him and his family to stay in the US.</p>
  
  <p>Ali's fear is not unfounded. Pakistan has been facing a wave of terrorism and political instability for many years now. According to the Global Terrorism Index, Pakistan was ranked as the fourth most affected country by terrorism in 2019. This highlights the fact that the threat of violence and terrorism is very real in Pakistan, and it is one of the main reasons why people are reluctant to return.</p>
  <p>Another reason why people are hesitant to return to Pakistan is the lack of economic opportunities. Many Pakistanis who live abroad have succeeded in finding good jobs and are able to provide a better standard of living for their families. On the other hand, Pakistan's economy has been struggling for many years, and there is a high unemployment rate. This means that even if people do return to Pakistan, they may struggle to find good jobs and support their families.</p>
