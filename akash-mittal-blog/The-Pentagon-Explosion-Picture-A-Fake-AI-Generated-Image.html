   <main>
    <p>Have you ever seen a picture of something that never happened? That's what happened with the Pentagon Explosion Picture that went viral online a few years ago.</p><img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2012/11/04/04/13/bomb-64223_960_720.jpg" alt="explosion">
    <p>The picture shows a huge explosion at the Pentagon, supposedly caused by a terrorist attack. However, the truth is that the picture is a fake, generated by an AI technology that can create realistic images of events that never actually occurred.</p>
    <h3>The Dangers of Fake News and AI Technology</h3>
    <p>The Pentagon Explosion Picture is just one example of how easily people can be misled by fake news and manipulated images online. With the rise of AI technology, it's becoming even easier to create realistic images and videos that can fool anyone into believing something that never happened.</p>
    <p>This has serious implications for the way we consume information online and the trust that we place in what we see on our screens. The risk of being misled by fake news and manipulated images is greater than ever before, and we need to be aware of this danger and take steps to protect ourselves.</p>
    <h3>Quantifiable Examples</h3>
    <ul>
     <li>In a study conducted by Pew Research Center, it was found that 64% of Americans have been exposed to fake news on social media.</li>
     <li>A survey by Ipsos Mori revealed that only 26% of Americans trust news they see on social media.</li>
     <li>Research conducted by MIT found that it takes only 10 likes for an AI-generated article to go viral on social media.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to Protect Yourself from Fake News</h3>
    <p>Here are some practical tips that you can use to protect yourself from fake news:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Be skeptical of information that seems too good or bad to be true.</li>
     <li>Check the source of the information and see if it's trustworthy.</li>
     <li>Verify the information through multiple sources before sharing it with others.</li>
     <li>Use fact-checking sites such as Snopes or FactCheck.org to check the validity of a story.</li>
     <li>Be careful about the information you share online and verify its accuracy before sharing it with others.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>

It serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of fake news and manipulated images online, and the need for us to be vigilant in protecting ourselves from this threat. By being skeptical, verifying information, and using fact-checking tools, we can take steps to ensure that we are informed by accurate information and not misled by false information.</p>
