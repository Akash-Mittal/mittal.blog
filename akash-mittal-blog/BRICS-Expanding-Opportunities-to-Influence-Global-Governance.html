   <section id="introduction">
    <p>At the turn of the century, leaders from Brazil, Russia, India, China, and later South Africa, came together and formed what is known as BRICS. BRICS refers to these countries with rapidly growing economies that are not quite developed yet but are expected to be among the most dominant economies in the world in the near future.</p>
    <p>Today, BRICS countries are emerging as powerful players on the global stage and are expanding their opportunities to influence global governance. By 2050, these countries are expected to account for more than half of the world's economic growth, according to Goldman Sachs.</p>
    <p>In this article, we will explore the expanding opportunities that BRICS countries have to influence global governance.</p>

    <h2>A Personal Story</h2>
    <p>My friend, Arvind, is an Indian citizen who was studying in the United States. He was planning to get a job there after graduation but ended up returning to India after his studies. When I asked him why he chose to go back, he said, "India is the future, and I want to be a part of that future."</p>
    <p>Arvind's story is just one example of how people from BRICS countries are embracing their countries' potential for growth. As these countries' economies continue to grow, their influence on the world stage is also growing.</p>
