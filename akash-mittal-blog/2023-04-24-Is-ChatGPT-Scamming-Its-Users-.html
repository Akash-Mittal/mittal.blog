    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>Imagine you're on the hunt for a new online service that can help you with your everyday needs. You stumble upon ChatGPT, a website that offers various services such as homework help, online therapy, and even online dating. You think it's the perfect solution for your needs and sign up.</p>
    <p>After using the service for a while, you realize that things aren't quite right. You notice that the homework help you received was plagiarized, the online therapy session didn't make you feel any better, and the online dating service was a complete scam.</p>
    <p>You try to contact the ChatGPT team, but they don't respond. You decide to reach out to consumer protection bodies to investigate ChatGPT and see if they are legit or a scam.</p>
