   <p>When it comes to their children's health, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge take no chances. They hired a "no-nonsense" nanny, Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo, to take care of Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis. And one of her strict rules is about their eating habits.</p>
   <p>The nanny believes in the importance of a healthy and balanced diet for the royal kids. She enforces a "no snacks" policy between meals, encouraging them to eat nutritious food instead. According to reports, she also prepares home-cooked meals for the children in Kensington Palace.</p>
