  <p class="intro">During the Cannes Film Festival, actor and writer Sean Penn took a stand against AI and discussed how it will affect the entertainment industry. Penn, who has backed the WGA strike, called the AI dispute a "human obscenity" in light of how it may lead to job displacement among writers and actors.</p>
  <h2 class="section-title">AI and the Entertainment Industry</h2>
  <p>AI, or artificial intelligence, has been a hot topic in the entertainment industry for quite some time. It has already been used to create movie trailers and even entire films, such as the sci-fi thriller "Morgan," which was co-written by AI program Benjamin. But while AI has the potential to revolutionize the industry, it also has the potential to displace human workers.</p>
  <p>Penn expressed his concerns about AI in a panel discussion at the Cannes Film Festival, saying that it will be especially detrimental to writers and actors:</p>
  <blockquote>
   "The idea that creativity can be replicated by a machine is a human obscenity. The entertainment industry is about expression, about telling stories and sharing human emotions. If AI takes over, it will be a sad day for humanity."
  </blockquote>
  <h2 class="section-title"> AI Displacing Human Workers</h2>
  <p>Penn's concerns are not unfounded. There are already numerous examples of AI displacing human workers in various industries. For example:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>In Japan, a hotel staffed almost entirely by robots laid off over half of its robotic workforce due to poor performance.</li>
   <li>In the United States, a company called Momentum Machines has developed a robot that can make a burger from start to finish, potentially replacing human fast food workers.</li>
   <li>In the UK, a team of researchers has developed an AI system that can write articles as well as a human journalist.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These examples demonstrate the potential impact of AI on the job market, and serve as a wakeup call for industry professionals to consider the consequences of AI's growing capabilities.</p>
  <h2 class="section-title">Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, AI presents both opportunities and challenges for the entertainment industry. While it has the potential to enhance production and revolutionize storytelling, it also has the potential to displace human workers. Here are three key takeaways from Sean Penn's concerns over AI and the entertainment industry:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>The idea of creativity being replicated by machines is a human obscenity, and the industry must take a critical look at how AI will affect job displacement among writers and actors.</li>
   <li>There are quantifiable examples of AI already displacing human workers in various industries, and this serves as a warning to the entertainment industry to consider the long-term impact of AI on the job market.</li>
   <li>The entertainment industry has a responsibility to consider the ethical implications of AI and to find ways to integrate AI into production in a way that benefits both humans and machines.</li>
