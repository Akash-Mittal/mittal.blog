  <p>Once upon a time, there was a farmer named Jack who owned a vast piece of land. He had two children, Lily and John, whom he loved dearly. One day, he realized that his children could not work alone on the farm forever and they needed an education. He sent them to school, and they learned basic skills like reading, writing, and arithmetic. However, there were new skills that the school system could not teach Lily and John. Jack wanted his children to learn survival skills, how to strategize and adapt in unforeseen circumstances. So, he hired a private tutor to teach his children and gave them the opportunity to learn new skills that would prepare them for their future.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Similarly, the White House recently released the National AI Research and Development Strategic Plan and the National AI Ethics Framework. These plans are aimed at encouraging the adoption of AI and its ethical use in various sectors. The framework includes recommendations for educators on how to integrate AI into their curriculum and how to teach skills that will be valuable in the future.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable Examples</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the world. In the transportation sector, driverless cars are being developed, and by 2025, their sale is expected to reach over ten million. In the healthcare sector, AI is being used for faster medical diagnoses, and in logistics, it is being used for efficient warehouse management. Furthermore, according to market data, the artificial intelligence in education market is projected to reach $3.7 billion by 2023. It shows that AI adoption in education will benefit both students as well as educational institutions.</p>

  <p>"The Artificial Intelligence Revolution: How Educators Can Prepare Students for the Future"</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p>As an individual who came from a small town, I did not have access to resources that would prepare me for the future. Despite the challenges, I was able to navigate the system and acquire the skills I needed to succeed. However, with the advancement in technology, educators can provide better access to resources for students to learn skills that will be valuable in their future.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case Study</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In India, The Next School is a case study of how AI is transforming the education system. The school has implemented an AI ethics curriculum that comprises machine learning, big data, and cloud computing. Additionally, the curriculum focuses on the development of ethical AI systems, data privacy, and digital citizenship. The school's robotics lab is equipped with programming tools, Lego Mindstorms, and Python software, which helps in the development of AI-powered systems. Students learn fundamental concepts such as AI algorithms and the application of natural language processing algorithms.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The national AI frameworks are recommendations aimed at encouraging the use of AI in various sectors. The recommendations for educators are vital in preparing students for the future. Here are some critical points to consider:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. AI integration into the curriculum will help students to acquire essential skills that will prepare them for the future. Educators should collaborate with tech companies to provide students access to AI tools, coding software, and machine learning software.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. AI ethics should be taught in schools to prepare students to be responsible AI users. Educators should teach awareness of AI bias, proficient use of AI algorithms, and the application of AI systems in everyday life.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. AI education provides marginalised students with the opportunity to learn and pursue careers in tech. Educators should provide equal access to resources and mentorship programs that will support students who want to pursue a career in tech.</p>
