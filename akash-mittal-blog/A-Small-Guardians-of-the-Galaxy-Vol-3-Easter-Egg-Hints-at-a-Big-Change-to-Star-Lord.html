    <h2>The Small Easter Egg</h2>
    <p>At the end of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2, we saw the introduction of Adam Warlock. But in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3, it's highly likely that another new character will make an appearance â€“ none other than Quasar!</p>
    <p>What evidence do we have for this theory? A small Easter egg that appeared in one of the deleted scenes of the second movie.</p>
    <p>In the scene in question, Star-Lord can be seen holding a small device that looks like a Quasar quantum band. This is a nod to the comic book character who is the latest hero to take the mantle of Quasar. He wore the quantum bands and was an expert in quantum physics. It's a small Easter egg, but it hints at something big for the future of Star-Lord.</p>

    <h2>The Implications</h2>
    <p>What does this Easter egg mean for Star-Lord?</p>
    <ol>
     <li>It could mean that Star-Lord is going to be tapping into his Quantum powers: the same powers that Quasar is known to possess in the comics. This would give Star-Lord an exciting new power set that could lead to some epic battles in the movie.</li>
     <li>This could also mean that Star-Lord might be taking on the mantle of Quasar in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This would be a major change to his character and could lead to some interesting storylines in the future.</li>
     <li>Another possibility is that Quasar may make an appearance in the movie, and Star-Lord will simply come into contact with the quantum bands. This could lead to an interesting interaction between the two characters and a new dynamic in the team.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These implications hint at the fact that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 will be a game-changer for Star-Lord and the entire Guardians team. Marvel is known for keeping their fans on the edge of their seat, and this Easter egg is no different.</p>
