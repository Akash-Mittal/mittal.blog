    <h2>An interesting story:</h2>
    <p>On August 6, 1945, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on the city of Hiroshima in Japan, killing thousands of people instantly and causing long-term damage to the environment and health of the survivors and the successive generations. Despite the horror of this event, the international community failed to prevent the development and proliferation of nuclear weapons, which have been used in other conflicts and continue to pose a grave threat to global security.</p>
    <p>On June 12, 2018, the United States and North Korea held a historic summit in Singapore, where they signed a joint statement to work towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the normalization of diplomatic relations. Despite the skepticism and criticisms of the agreement, it represented a rare opportunity for dialogue and cooperation between two countries that had been at odds for decades, and for the international community to demonstrate its commitment to peace and disarmament.</p>
    <h2>Quantifiable examples:</h2>
    <p>The Hiroshima bombing killed an estimated 140,000 people by the end of 1945, and tens of thousands more later due to radiation sickness and other causes. The long-term effects of the bomb include increased cancer rates, birth defects, and psychological trauma among the survivors and their offspring.</p>
    <p>The North Korean nuclear program is estimated to have produced enough fissile material for up to 20 nuclear weapons, with the potential to hit South Korea, Japan, and even the United States with ballistic missiles. The US and its allies have imposed economic sanctions and military pressure on North Korea to persuade it to abandon its nuclear ambitions, while North Korea has demanded security guarantees and diplomatic recognition in exchange for denuclearization.</p>
    <h2>An eye-catching or magnetic title:</h2>
    <blockquote>

    </blockquote>
    <h2>Conclusion in 3 points:</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>The Hiroshima bombing and the North Korean nuclear program are two examples of the destructive power and the risks of nuclear weapons.</li>
     <li>The US-North Korea summit represents a potential breakthrough in the diplomatic effort to address the North Korean nuclear threat and the broader security challenges in the Korean Peninsula and the region.</li>
     <li>The international community must continue to engage in dialogue, negotiation, and cooperation to prevent the use and the spread of nuclear weapons, and to promote peace, security, and development for all.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Personal anecdotes or case studies:</h2>
    <p>As a peace researcher, I have had the opportunity to meet and interview survivors of the atomic bombing in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as researchers, activists, and officials who work on disarmament and non-proliferation. Their stories and insights have inspired me to pursue my own research and advocacy on these issues, and to engage with others who share the vision of a world free from nuclear weapons.</p>
    <h2>Practical tips:</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>Educate yourself and others about the history, science, and politics of nuclear weapons, and their impact on human security and wellbeing.</li>
     <li>Take action and support organizations that work on disarmament, non-proliferation, and peacebuilding, such as the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), and the International Peace Bureau (IPB).</li>
     <li>Engage with policymakers, media, and civil society to raise awareness and demand action on nuclear disarmament and the broader agenda of human security, development, and justice.</li>
