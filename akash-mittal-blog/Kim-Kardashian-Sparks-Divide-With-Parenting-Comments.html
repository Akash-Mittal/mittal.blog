    <p>Kim Kardashian, the popular reality TV star, has always been in the limelight for various controversies, and her recent parenting comments have sparked a divide among fellow parents and social media users.</p>
    <p>In an interview with a leading lifestyle magazine, Kardashian revealed that she allows her children to have unrestricted access to technology and that she doesn't believe in setting strict boundaries for them. She also stated that it's important to let children explore and learn things on their own, and that parents shouldn't helicopter parent their kids.</p>
    <p>These comments didn't sit well with many parents who believe that setting boundaries and monitoring their children's screen time is crucial for their mental and physical well-being. The controversy escalated on social media, with both sides defending their point of view.</p>

     <li>A survey conducted by Common Sense Media found that 98% of households with children under the age of eight have access to a mobile device, and 42% of them own a tablet.</li>
     <li>The same survey found that children between the ages of 0-8 spend an average of 2 hours and 19 minutes on screens every day, and that their daily usage has increased by 48 minutes since 2011.</li>
