   <h3>An Eye-Opening Experience</h3>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>As a young adult, I thought I had my relationship with God all figured out. I went to church on Sundays, prayed every night, and tried to live my life according to the teachings of my religion. But after becoming a parent, I discovered that my relationship with God was about to take an unexpected turn.</p>
   <p>When my first child was born, I suddenly became acutely aware of two things: the incredible responsibility I now had as a parent to guide and nurture this little life, and the sheer magnitude of the love that flooded my heart for this tiny, helpless infant. It was a love I had never experienced before, and it was overwhelming.</p>
   <p>As I spent countless sleepless nights rocking my baby, I found myself praying more fervently than ever before. I begged God to help me be the kind of parent my child needed, to give me the wisdom and patience to guide them through life, and to protect them from harm. And as I prayed, I felt a new kind of closeness to God, a sense that He understood and shared my love for this precious child.</p>
   <p>This newfound connection to God only deepened as I watched my child grow and develop. I found myself in awe of the miracle of life and the incredible potential of each human being. And as I saw my child face challenges and overcome obstacles, I felt a sense of awe and gratitude to God, who had given this child the strength and resilience to persevere.</p>
   <h2> Change</h2>
   <p>As I reflect on how parenting has changed my relationship to God, there are a few specific examples that come to mind.</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Increased Prayer:</strong> As I mentioned earlier, I found myself praying more often and more fervently after becoming a parent. And studies have shown that I'm not alone in this. A 2015 poll found that 68% of parents pray for their children daily, compared to 42% of non-parents.</li>
    <li><strong>Greater Sense of Awe:</strong> The experience of watching my child grow and develop has filled me with a greater sense of awe and wonder at the complexity and beauty of the world around us. And this awe has spilled over into my spiritual life, as I contemplate the vastness and mystery of God's creation.</li>
    <li><strong>Deeper Sense of Gratitude:</strong> As I mentioned earlier, witnessing my child overcome challenges and achieve milestones has filled me with a sense of gratitude to God for the gift of this child and for the privilege of being their parent. This gratitude has also transformed the way I approach life in general, as I seek to cultivate a spirit of thanksgiving in all things.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusions</h2>
   <p>So what are the key takeaways from my experience of how parenting has changed my relationship to God? Here are three conclusions I have drawn:</p>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>Parenting can deepen our sense of spirituality:</strong> Becoming a parent can be a powerful reminder of the miracle of life and the fragility, beauty, and worth of every human being. This can lead to a greater sense of awe, appreciation, and reverence for God's creation, and a deeper connection to the divine.</li>
    <li><strong>Parenting can increase our faith:</strong> As parents, we are confronted with the reality of our own limitations and the unpredictability of life. This can lead us to rely more heavily on our faith and trust in God's plan, and to seek guidance and comfort from our spiritual practices.</li>
    <li><strong>Parenting can broaden our perspective:</strong> Parenthood is a humbling experience that teaches us to see beyond ourselves and to prioritize the needs of others. This can help us to develop a more compassionate and selfless attitude toward the world, and to seek out opportunities to serve and give back to our communities.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>Personal Reflections</h2>
   <p>For me, parenting has been a transformative experience that has deepened my relationship to God and my sense of purpose in life. But this is just one person's perspective. To get a fuller picture of the ways in which parenting can impact our spirituality, I reached out to a few other parents and asked them how becoming a parent has changed their relationship to God.</p>
   <p>One mother shared that motherhood has helped her to better understand the concept of God's unconditional love. "I never really got the whole 'God is our heavenly father' thing," she said. "But once I became a mom, I totally got it. I would do anything for my kids, I would never stop loving them, and I would always be there for them. And that's how I see God now."</p>
   <p>Another father shared that fatherhood has increased his sense of responsibility and purpose. "Before I became a dad, I just kind of floated through life," he said. "But now that I have kids, I feel like I have a real purpose. I want to be a good role model for them, and I want to make a positive impact in the world for their sake."</p>
   <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
   <p>If you're a parent who wants to deepen your relationship to God, here are a few practical tips to consider:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Pray regularly, both for your children and for yourself.</li>
    <li>Take time to appreciate the wonder and beauty of God's creation with your children.</li>
    <li>Seek out opportunities to serve others and show compassion.</li>
    <li>Find a community of like-minded parents who can support and encourage you.</li>
    <li>Make time for spiritual practices that nourish your soul, whether that's reading scripture, meditating, or attending religious services.</li>
   </ul>
