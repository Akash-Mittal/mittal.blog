   <p>In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic made it all too clear that the internet is no longer just a luxury, but a necessity for work, school, communication, entertainment, and more. As we spend more time online, experts believe we are on the cusp of a new era: Web 3.0.</p>
   <p>Web 3.0 refers to the third iteration of the internet, which is characterized by blockchain technology and the rise of artificial intelligence. Unlike Web 2.0, which focused on user-generated content, interactive web applications, and social media, Web 3.0 is all about decentralization, security, and privacy.</p>
   <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.consensys.net" target="_blank">Consensys</a>: A leader in the Web 3.0 space, Consensys is a blockchain software company that creates decentralized applications and infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.filecoin.com/" target="_blank">Filecoin</a>: A decentralized storage network, Filecoin aims to create a more open, efficient, and secure web by providing a peer-to-peer marketplace for buying and selling decentralized storage space.</li>
    <li><a href="https://singularitynet.io/" target="_blank">SingularityNET</a>: SingularityNET is a decentralized AI platform that allows developers to create, share, and monetize AI services at scale without relying on a centralized entity.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>According to recent market analysis, the Web 3.0 market is poised for exponential growth in the coming years. Research by MarketsandMarkets suggests that the market size will reach USD 81.9 billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 44.5% from 2021 to 2026.</p>
   <p>Real-life examples of Web 3.0 in action include:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Decentralized finance (DeFi): DeFi applications such as Uniswap and Aave allow users to trade cryptocurrencies, lend and borrow funds, and earn interest without intermediaries.</li>
    <li>Digital identity: Self-sovereign identity solutions such as uPort and Civic allow individuals to own and control their personal data, reducing the risk of identity theft and data breaches.</li>
    <li>Decentralized social networks: Platforms like Minds and Mastodon enable users to connect and share content without the advertising-driven business models of centralized social media giants like Facebook and Twitter.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>As the Web 3.0 movement gains momentum, it is clear that the future of the internet is decentralized, secure, and user-centric.</p>
