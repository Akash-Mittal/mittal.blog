    <p>Imagine a world where the internet is completely decentralized, free from central authorities and owned by its users. A world where artificial intelligence is used ethically, with proper guardrails put in place to protect individuals from harmful impacts. It seems like a dream world, but with the advancements in technology and the rise of Web 3.0, this dream could soon become a reality.</p>

    <p>Web 3.0 has the potential to disrupt many industries, including finance, healthcare, and even government. Decentralized finance (DeFi) is one area that has already seen significant growth, with the total value locked in DeFi surpassing $80 billion in May 2021.</p>
    <p>As for AI, companies like Google have already implemented ethical principles for the development and use of AI systems. For example, Google's AI principles state that their technology should be socially beneficial, avoid creating or reinforcing bias, and be built and tested for safety.</p>
