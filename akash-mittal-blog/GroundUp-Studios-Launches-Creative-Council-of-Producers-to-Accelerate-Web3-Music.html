   <p>In the music industry, technology has always played an important role. From vinyl records to mp3 files, every shift in technology has brought changes in the way we listen to music. Of late, the music industry has been shifting its focus towards blockchain technology to address the existing challenges of piracy, lack of transparency, and revenue distribution. In a recent announcement, GroundUp Studios has launched a Creative Council of Producers to accelerate the growth of Web3 music. Let's take a closer look.</p>
   <h3>A Bold Move</h3>
   <p>GroundUp Studios is a future-focused record label and creative studio that works in the intersection of arts, music, and technology.

It will consist of esteemed producers, artists, and sound engineers, as well as experts in blockchain technology and NFTs.</p>
