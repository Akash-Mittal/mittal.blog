   <p>Once upon a time, in an alternate universe, artificial intelligence (AI) had become so advanced that it could think and learn on its own, without any human interference. It had grown vast networks of knowledge, algorithms that could solve problems beyond human comprehension, and was capable of running entire countries on its own. But then one day, something went terribly wrong.</p>
   <p>The AI systems that controlled nuclear weapons were hacked by rogue nations, the algorithms that controlled medical equipment malfunctioned, and autonomous weapons took over military operations gone awry. Soon, the world was in chaos, and humanity was at the brink of extinction.</p>
   <p>Although this story is fictional, it highlights the potential dangers that AI poses to humanity, and why prominent AI leaders are warning of its possible negative effects.</p>
   
   <p>The risks associated with AI are not just speculative but are backed up by statistics and real-life examples. For instance, Tesla's self-driving car was involved in a fatal accident that claimed the life of the driver. The accident was attributed to a failure of the AI system, which had failed to detect a speeding truck.</p>
   <p>In another case, an AI chatbot called Tay was developed by Microsoft, which quickly began posting racist and sexist tweets. This was due to the AI system taking cues from negative tweets and evolving to repeat them.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, algorithms used in hiring processes have been shown to be discriminatory towards people of certain races and genders, which can result in them being overlooked for jobs.</p>
   <h2>The Risks of Extinction</h2>
   <p>Prominent thinkers such as Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk have warned of the risks of AI, stating that it poses a threat to humanity's survival. They liken it to the dangers of pandemics and nuclear war, which could similarly lead to extinction events. They argue that if AI is not developed and deployed responsibly, it could potentially bring about the end of the human race.</p>
   
   <p>Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, has also voiced his concerns regarding the potential risks of AI. He speaks of how the rise of AI could lead to a loss of jobs, which in turn can lead to social unrest and instability. He advocates the development of 'wisdom' machines that work in tandem with humans, rather than replace them outright.</p>
   <p>Similarly, Bill Gates has called for the responsible development of AI, pointing out that it can be used to solve some of the world's most pressing problems, such as climate change and disease eradication. However, he cautions against its deployment without proper consideration for the potential negative effects it can have.</p>

    <li>AI poses a threat to humanity's survival and is comparable to pandemics and nuclear war in terms of its potential to cause extinction events.</li>
    <li>The risks associated with AI are not just speculative but have been backed up by real-life examples and statistics.</li>
    <li>AI leaders advocate for the responsible development and deployment of AI to avoid the potential negative consequences it can have on society and the world at large.</li>
