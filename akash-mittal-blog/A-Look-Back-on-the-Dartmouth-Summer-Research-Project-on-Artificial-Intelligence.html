   <p>It was the summer of 1956, and a group of computer scientists, mathematicians, and philosophers gathered at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.</p>
   <p>Their goal? To explore the potential of artificial intelligence, or AI.</p>
   <p>The group included John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, Claude Shannon, and other luminaries in the field.</p>
   <p>They spent two months working together, laying the groundwork for what would eventually become a field that has revolutionized the world we live in.</p>
   <h2>AI Today</h2>
   <p>Today, AI is all around us. From Siri and Alexa to self-driving cars, AI is transforming the way we live, work, and play.</p>
   <p>But it all started with the Dartmouth Summer Research Project.</p>
   <h2>Some Quantifiable Examples</h2>
   <p>Here are just a few examples of how AI is being used today:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>AI is used in healthcare to diagnose diseases and suggest treatment options.</li>
