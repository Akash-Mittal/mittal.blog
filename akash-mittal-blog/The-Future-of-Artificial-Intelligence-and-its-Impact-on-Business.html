    <p>It was a busy day at the office, and Sarah was struggling to keep up with her workload. Just as she was about to take a lunch break, her boss called her and gave her an urgent task. Sarah was about to freak out when a chatbot on her computer screen caught her attention. The bot introduced itself as 'AI assistant' and asked if it could help her with anything. Sarah decided to give it a shot, and within minutes, the chatbot had completed the task her boss had given her. Sarah was amazed at how quickly and efficiently the AI assistant had helped her, and she realized that this was just beginning of how AI would impact the future of business.</p>

    <p>Artificial intelligence has already revolutionized many industries, and it's only going to become more pervasive in the coming years. Let's take a look at some real-life examples:</p>
    <ol>
     <li><a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson">IBM Watson</a>: IBM Watson is a cognitive computing framework that uses natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to analyze large data sets. It has been used in various industries, including healthcare, finance, and retail, to make complex decisions and predict outcomes.</li>
     <li><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/index.html">NVIDIA</a>: NVIDIA is a company that specializes in graphics processing units (GPU). Its GPUs are used in AI applications like self-driving cars, computer vision, and language translation.</li>
     <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Web-Services-AWS-CloudComputing/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=3611076011">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a>: AWS provides cloud-based computing, storage, and networking services. It has a range of AI tools and services, including Amazon SageMaker, which allows developers to build, train, and deploy machine learning models.</li>

    <p>Artificial intelligence is an exciting technology that has the potential to transform the way we work. However, it's important to also consider the potential risks and challenges of AI. Here are three critical comments:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>AI can create job displacement and widen the wealth gap between skilled and unskilled workers.</li>
     <li>AI algorithms can be biased and perpetuate existing inequalities and injustices.</li>
     <li>There needs to be more regulation and ethical frameworks for the development and deployment of AI.</li>
    </ul>
