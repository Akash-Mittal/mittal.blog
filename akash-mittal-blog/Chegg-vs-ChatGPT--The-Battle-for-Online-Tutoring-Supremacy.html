    <p>It was a hot summer day and Jack, a high school student, was struggling with his math homework. He decided to seek help online and found himself torn between two of the biggest names in the online tutoring business - Chegg and ChatGPT. While he had heard great things about Chegg from his classmates, he stumbled upon ChatGPT's website and found their services to be more affordable and easy-to-use.</p>
    <p>This scenario is becoming increasingly common among students around the world as more and more online tutoring companies are entering the market. However, the rise of ChatGPT is causing some major concerns for Chegg's revenue streams.</p>

    <h2>Real Life Examples</h2>
    <p>Let's take a look at some real-life examples of how ChatGPT is making waves in the online tutoring market:</p>
    <ul>
     <li><a href="https://www.chatgpt.com/p/homework-help.html" target="_blank">ChatGPT's Homework Help</a> service is gaining popularity due to its 24/7 availability, affordable pricing and high-quality tutoring. Chegg, on the other hand, only offers homework help during limited hours and at a higher cost.</li>
     <li><a href="https://www.chatgpt.com/p/online-classes.html" target="_blank">ChatGPT's Online Classes</a> are becoming a favorite among students due to their interactive nature, personalized approach and expert faculty. Chegg also offers online classes, but their platform is not as user-friendly and lacks the same level of engagement as ChatGPT's.</li>
     <li><a href="https://www.chatgpt.com/p/essay-writing-help.html" target="_blank">ChatGPT's Essay Writing Help</a> is gaining traction due to its high-quality writing and editing services, which are not offered by Chegg. This is a major drawback for Chegg as essay writing help is a popular service among students.</li>
    </ul>
