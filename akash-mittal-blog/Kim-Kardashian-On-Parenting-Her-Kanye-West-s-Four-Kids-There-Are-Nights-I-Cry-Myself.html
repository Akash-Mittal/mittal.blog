   <p>A few years ago, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West were in the headlines for their lavish lifestyle, glamorous fashion statements, and A-list parties. But these days, the couple has been making headlines for a different reason: their parenting struggles.</p>
   <p>In a recent interview, Kim Kardashian opened up about how she handles the challenges of being a mother to four young children while managing her career, marriage, and a high-profile divorce. She admitted that there are nights when she cries herself to sleep, feeling overwhelmed by the demands of motherhood and the pressure to live up to her own expectations.</p>
   <blockquote>
    "I think about my kids 24/7, and sometimes I just feel like I'm not doing enough for them," Kardashian said. "I want to be the best mother I can be, but it's hard when there are so many other things going on in my life."
   </blockquote>
   
   <p>Kim Kardashian's struggles with juggling motherhood and career are not unique. Many working mothers around the world face the same challenges every day. Here are some quantifiable examples:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>According to a 2019 study by the Pew Research Center, moms spend an average of 25 hours a week on paid work, compared to 17 hours for dads.</li>
    <li>A survey of 1,000 working mothers by the app Peanut found that 82% feel overwhelmed by the amount of responsibilities they have to juggle.</li>
    <li>Another survey by the Working Mother Research Institute found that 78% of working moms reported feeling stress related to their job, while 57% reported feeling stress related to their family.</li>
   </ul>
   
   <p>To illustrate the challenges of being a working mom, here are some personal anecdotes shared by other women:</p>
   <blockquote>
    "I remember once, I was on a business trip and I got a video call from my toddler daughter, and I could hear her crying and asking for me. That was one of the hardest moments of my life. I wanted to be there for her, but I also had to be there for my job." - Andrea, 34, marketing manager and mother of two
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote>
    "My husband and I share the housework and childcare duties equally, but people always assume that I'm the one who does everything. One time, my boss asked me to stay late for a project, and I had to decline because I had to pick up my kids from daycare. He said, 'But can't your husband do it for once?' It's frustrating, because I feel like I have to constantly justify my choices as a mother." - Samantha, 40, IT manager and mother of three

   <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
   <p>If you're a working mom who's feeling overwhelmed, here are some practical tips to help you manage your time and energy:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Set realistic goals - don't try to be perfect, and don't compare yourself to other moms.</li>
    <li>Delegate tasks - ask your partner, family members, or friends for help with childcare, housework, or errands.</li>
    <li>Take breaks - it's important to recharge your batteries and do something that makes you happy, whether it's reading a book, going for a walk, or taking a nap.</li>
    <li>Practice self-care - make time for yourself, whether it's a bubble bath, a yoga class, or a massage.</li>
    <li>Be kind to yourself - remember that you're doing the best you can, and that it's okay to make mistakes sometimes.</li>
   </ol>
