   <p>As parents, we all make mistakes. But when it comes to parenting in the public eye, like Trent and Amber Johnston do in their reality TV show, 7 Little Johnstons, those mistakes can be magnified and scrutinized by millions of viewers. Here are 10 of their worst parenting mistakes and what we can learn from them:</p>
   <h2>1. Not setting clear boundaries</h2>
   <p>One of the biggest mistakes that Trent and Amber make is not setting clear boundaries for their children. This leads to confusion and inconsistency in their parenting. For example, the children are allowed to eat junk food in some situations but not in others, with no clear explanation why. This can lead to frustration and resentment from both the parents and the children.</p>
   <p>Tip: Make sure to set clear and consistent boundaries for your children, and explain the reasoning behind them. This will help avoid confusion and promote better behavior.</p>
   <h2>2. Overprotecting their children</h2>
   <p>Trent and Amber have a tendency to be overprotective of their children, especially due to their small stature. While it's important to keep children safe, it's also important to allow them to take appropriate risks and learn from their mistakes. Overprotecting can hinder a child's growth and development.</p>
   <p>Tip: Find a balance between keeping your children safe and allowing them to take risks and learn from their mistakes. This will help them develop confidence and independence.</p>
   <h2>3. Favoritism towards certain children</h2>
   <p>In the show, it's clear that Trent and Amber have a favorite child, Anna. This can cause resentment and jealousy among the other children and lead to a lack of trust and respect towards the parents.</p>
   <p>Tip: Show equal love and attention to all of your children, and avoid playing favorites. This will help promote a positive and healthy relationship with all of them.</p>
   <h2>4. Ignoring their children's emotions</h2>
   <p>There are many instances in the show where Trent and Amber ignore their children's emotional needs and dismiss them as being "dramatic" or "overreacting." This can lead to a lack of empathy and a breakdown in communication.</p>
   <p>Tip: Take the time to listen to your children's feelings and validate them. This will help them feel heard and understood.</p>
   <h2>5. Not involving their children in decision making</h2>
   <p>Trent and Amber often make decisions for their children without involving them in the process. This can lead to a lack of autonomy and a feeling of powerlessness.</p>
   <p>Tip: Involve your children in decision making when appropriate, and allow them to have a say in their own lives. This will help them develop independence and responsibility.</p>
   <h2>6. Focusing too much on achievement</h2>
   <p>Trent and Amber place a heavy emphasis on achievement, especially when it comes to school. While it's important to encourage and support your children, too much pressure and focus on achievement can lead to anxiety and burnout.</p>
   <p>Tip: Celebrate your children's accomplishments, but also encourage them to rest and prioritize their mental health. Encourage a balance between hard work and self-care.</p>
   <h2>7. Not allowing their children to make mistakes</h2>
   <p>Trent and Amber often intervene and prevent their children from making mistakes, even if it means they won't learn a valuable lesson. This can hinder a child's growth and confidence.</p>
   <p>Tip: Let your children make mistakes, and use them as an opportunity for growth and learning. This will help them develop resilience and confidence.</p>
   <h2>8. Comparing their children to others</h2>
   <p>In the show, Trent and Amber often compare their children to others, such as their siblings or other children their age. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy and a sense of not being good enough.</p>
   <p>Tip: Avoid comparing your children to others, and instead focus on their individual strengths and accomplishments. This will help promote self-esteem and confidence.</p>
   <h2>9. Overscheduling their children</h2>
   <p>Trent and Amber often overschedule their children with extracurricular activities and events, leaving no time for rest or self-care. This can lead to burnout and stress.</p>
   <p>Tip: Encourage your children to rest and prioritize their mental health, and avoid overscheduling them. This will help promote a healthy work-life balance.</p>
   <h2>10. Allowing TV show production to influence their parenting decisions</h2>
   <p>Lastly, it's important to note that Trent and Amber's parenting decisions are sometimes influenced by the demands of the TV show production. This can lead to decisions that prioritize viewer entertainment over their children's well-being.</p>
   <p>Tip: Prioritize your children's well-being over any outside influences, including TV show production or social media. This will help promote a healthy and positive family dynamic.</p>
