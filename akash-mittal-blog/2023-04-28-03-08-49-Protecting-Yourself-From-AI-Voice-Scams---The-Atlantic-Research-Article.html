    <p>Imagine receiving a phone call from a friend, except it's not really your friend â it's a scammer using artificial intelligence to mimic their voice. This is just one example of the kind of AI voice scams that are becoming increasingly common in our digital world.</p>
    <p>In this article, we'll discuss how you can protect yourself from these scams by understanding how they work and what you can do to prevent them.</p>
    <p>Real-life examples of AI voice scams include companies like Amazon and Google falling prey to fraudulent activities. Amazonâs Alexa was used to scam a user out of $1,700 by impersonating a customer support representative. Google's Duplex technology can replicate human-like conversations, allowing scammers to trick unsuspecting victims into divulging sensitive information or making payments.</p>
    <p>So, what can you do to protect yourself from AI voice scams? Here are three key points to keep in mind:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Never give out personal information or make payments over the phone unless you're certain of the caller's identity.</li>
     <li>Use two-factor authentication when making online purchases or setting up new accounts.</li>
     <li>Be wary of unexpected calls or messages, especially those that claim to be urgent or from a government agency.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>By following these simple guidelines, you can reduce the risk of falling victim to AI voice scams.</p>
