    <h2>The Story of AMD</h2>
    <p>In 1969, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) was founded by Jerry Sanders and seven other engineers with the goal of designing cutting-edge semiconductors. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, AMD competed with industry giant Intel in the microprocessor market, eventually becoming a key player in the industry. Despite facing many challenges over the years, including financial struggles and legal battles, AMD has managed to consistently innovate and adapt to changing market conditions.</p>
    <p>Today, AMD is known for producing high-performance CPUs and GPUs that are used in a wide range of products, from gaming consoles to supercomputers. With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), AMD is once again poised to gain a significant share of a rapidly growing market.</p>
