    <h3>The Search for Better Materials</h3>
    <p>For years, scientists and engineers have been on a quest to find better materials for use in a variety of industries, from aerospace to electronics to medicine. Traditional methods of discovering new materials have involved trial and error, with researchers testing different combinations of elements and observing their properties. However, this process can be time-consuming and expensive, and often leads to dead ends.</p>
    <p>Recently, researchers at MIT have been developing new methods to improve material discovery and design. One promising approach involves using artificial intelligence (AI) to identify similar materials in images, which could lead to more efficient discoveries and faster development of new materials.</p>

    <h3>Quantifiable Examples</h3>
    <p>Using their AI system, the MIT researchers were able to identify similar materials in a dataset of over 37,000 images of crystals. The system was able to group the images into clusters based on similarities in their structures and properties. This allowed the researchers to discover new materials that had not been previously identified, as well as predict the properties of these materials.</p>
    <p>The team also used their system to analyze images of polymers, another common class of materials. They were able to identify patterns in the images that corresponded to key properties of the polymers, such as strength and flexibility.</p>
    <p>These results show the potential of AI in improving material discovery and design, and could have major implications for a wide range of industries.</p>
