    <p>However, one day she stumbled upon PREPARES, a program offered by her local Catholic church that provides free pregnancy and parenting support. Through PREPARES, she was connected with a mentor who helped her navigate her pregnancy and prepare for motherhood.</p>
    <p>With the support of PREPARES, Julie felt empowered and confident in her ability to care for her child. Today, she has a beautiful baby boy and is grateful for the help she received from PREPARES.</p>
