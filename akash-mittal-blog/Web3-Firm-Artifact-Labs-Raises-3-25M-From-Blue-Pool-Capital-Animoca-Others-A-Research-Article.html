    <p>Have you heard about Artifact Labs? The Web3 firm is making headlines with its latest funding round, which raised $3.25M from top investors like Blue Pool Capital and Animoca.</p>
    <p>But what is Web3, and how is Artifact Labs using it to shake things up?</p>
    <h2>What Is Web3?</h2>
    <p>Web3 is the next evolution of the internet. While Web1 was about static web pages and Web2 was about social media and user-generated content, Web3 is about decentralization and blockchain technology.</p>
    <p>Web3 will allow us to create a truly decentralized internet, with no central authority controlling our data or online activities. This will have huge implications for industries like finance, healthcare, and more.</p>
    <h2>How Is Artifact Labs Using Web3?</h2>
    <p>Artifact Labs is using Web3 to create a decentralized marketplace for digital assets. This marketplace will allow users to buy, sell, and trade digital assets like NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and other blockchain-based assets.</p>
    <p>By using blockchain technology, Artifact Labs can create a marketplace that is truly decentralized, with no company or entity controlling the market. This will make buying and selling digital assets more secure and transparent.</p>
    <h2>Who Invested In Artifact Labs?</h2>
    <p>Artifact Labs' latest funding round raised $3.25M from top venture capital firms like Blue Pool Capital and Animoca, as well as other investors like Hashed and Alameda Research.</p>
    <p>Blue Pool Capital is a Hong Kong-based investment firm that manages the personal wealth of its founder, Tencent co-founder Chen Yidan. Animoca is a blockchain-based gaming company with a portfolio of over 150 games and apps.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The funding round for Artifact Labs shows that there is increasing interest in Web3 and blockchain technology. With its decentralized marketplace for digital assets, Artifact Labs is poised to become a major player in the Web3 ecosystem.</p>
    <p>But as with any new technology, there are risks and challenges to be aware of. It remains to be seen how Web3 will be regulated and how companies like Artifact Labs will navigate these regulatory hurdles.</p>
    <p>One thing is clear, however – Web3 is the future, and we can expect to see more companies like Artifact Labs emerge in the coming years.</p>
