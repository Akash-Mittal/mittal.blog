    <p>Its no secret that tech giants have become adept at using AI hype to bury their mediocre results. This has been demonstrated in recent quarters, as companies such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon have announced a string of uninspiring earnings reports.</p>
    <p>However, the problem of hiding behind AI hype goes deeper than these companies quarterly results. It is a symptom of a larger issue  one that is affecting the entire tech industry.</p>
    
    <p>Recently, a small startup company named AitoAI beat IBM, Google, and Microsoft in the TREC (Text REtrieval Conference) algorithm competition. AitoAI was founded by a team of three researchers who developed a unique approach to information retrieval that combined machine learning with human intuition.</p>
    <p>Their approach was so successful that it outperformed the algorithms developed by tech giants with exponentially larger budgets and resources. This shows that AI is not a magic bullet that can solve all problems. Instead, it requires careful planning, cooperation, and human input.</p>
    <h2>Concrete Examples</h2>
    <p>The use of AI hype to bury mediocre results is not limited to quarterly earnings reports. It can also be seen in the following areas:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>AI-powered chatbots that cannot handle basic customer queries</li>
     <li>Self-driving cars that cannot avoid accidents</li>
     <li>AI assistants that provide irrelevant information or fail to execute basic tasks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The problem with AI hype is that it creates unrealistic expectations among consumers and investors.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>AI is a powerful tool, but it is not a magic bullet.</li>
     <li>Companies need to be more transparent about their AI capabilities and limitations.</li>
     <li>Human input is still critical in developing successful AI solutions.</li>
    </ol>
