  <h1>The Revolution of Telcos: Smart Enters Web3 with BlockchainSpace Partnership</h1> <img src="images/Smart-Enters-Web3-with-BlockchainSpace-Partnership.jpeg" alt="+Smart-Enters-Web3-with-BlockchainSpace-Partnership+">
  <p>When John, a resident in rural Philippines, tried to make a call from his mobile phone, he found no signal. He tried walking to different locations to get a signal but to no avail. A few days later, he heard about Smart Communications, a telecommunication company that promised nationwide coverage and service reliability, and he decided to give it a try.</p>
