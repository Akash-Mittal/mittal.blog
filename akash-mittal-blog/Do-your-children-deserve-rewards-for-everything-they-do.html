   <p>When my daughter Alice was five years old, she came home from school with a certificate for good attendance.</p>
   <p>She was over the moon with excitement and proudly showed it to everyone she met.</p>
   <p>As a proud parent, I couldn't help but feel happy for her and encouraged her to keep up the good work.</p>
   <p>But then it got me thinking, should children be rewarded for everything they do? Does it set unrealistic expectations for them in the future?</p>
   <p>Let's explore this topic further.</p>
   <h2>Examples of over-rewarding children</h2>
   <p>Parents may have different reasons for wanting to reward their children for everything they do.</p>
   <p>Some may want to boost their self-esteem or motivate them to achieve their goals.</p>
   <p>However, rewarding your child for doing everyday tasks such as brushing their teeth or completing their homework may send the wrong message.</p>
   <p>It creates a culture of entitlement, where children expect to be rewarded for everything they do, both big and small.</p>
   <p>For example, if a child is given a reward for every assignment they complete, they may become more focused on the reward than the actual learning process.</p>
   <p>They may also feel disappointed or discouraged if they do not receive a reward for something they expected to be rewarded for.</p>
   <h2>Case study: The helicopter parent</h2>
   <p>Let me tell you about a friend of mine, Jane, who has two children, a boy and a girl.</p>
   <p>Jane is what we call a helicopter parent â€“ always hovering around her children and ensuring they have everything they need.</p>
   <p>One day, her son asked her for a new video game that had just been released.</p>
   <p>Jane promised to buy it for him if he got an A on his math test.</p>
   <p>Her son studied hard and aced the test, but when Jane went to buy the video game, it was already sold out.</p>
   <p>Her son was deeply disappointed and asked her to buy it for him from an online store.</p>
   <p>Jane complied, but the incident made her realize that she had been over-rewarding her children for their accomplishments.</p>
   <p>She started to set realistic expectations for them and encouraged them to strive for goals without expecting a reward in return.</p>
   <h2>Practical tips for parenting without over-rewarding</h2>
   <p>So, how can you raise your child without over-rewarding them?</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Set clear expectations: Communicate clearly with your child about what you expect of them, whether it's doing their chores or getting good grades. Make sure they understand that it's a responsibility and not something they will be rewarded for every time.</li>
    <li>Focus on intrinsic motivation: Encourage your child to find joy in their accomplishments rather than focusing solely on external rewards. Praise your child for their efforts and hard work rather than just their achievements.</li>
    <li>Occasional rewards: It's okay to reward your child for a significant achievement or on special occasions, such as their birthday or a holiday. However, make sure it's not an everyday thing, and they understand that it's not a given.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>While it's natural for parents to want to reward their children for their accomplishments, over-rewarding can have negative consequences.</p>
   <p>It can create entitled behavior and unrealistic expectations for the future. Instead, set clear expectations, focus on intrinsic motivation, and occasionally reward your child for their accomplishments.</p>
   <p>Remember, raising a successful and happy child is not about giving them everything but teaching them the skills they need to succeed in life.</p>
