   <p>Imagine you're a business owner who needs to hire several employees before the end of the month. But instead of going through countless resumes and conducting interviews, you just need to write a job description and let Artificial Intelligence (AI) do the rest.</p>
   <p>That's exactly what HireVue, an AI platform, offers. Their program uses predictive analytics and machine learning to scan resumes, conduct video and personality assessments, and provide potential employee rankings. No interviews necessary.</p>
   <p>But it's not just HR departments who are benefiting from AI. From self-driving cars to voice assistants, AI has become a crucial component of technology today. And the growth of AI is only going to continue. Here are just a few examples:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Google's machine learning platform, TensorFlow, is used in everything from image and speech recognition to self-driving cars.</li>
    <li>IBM's Watson, a natural language processor, is used in healthcare to help diagnose illnesses and in finance to mitigate risks.</li>
    <li>Amazon's Alexa is a voice assistant that can play music, answer questions, and control smart home devices.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>While the applications of AI are vast and varied, the benefits are clear. AI can speed up processes, reduce human error, and even make predictions about the future.</p>
   <p>So, what's next for AI? Here are three predictions:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>AI will continue to become more personalized, allowing for hyper-targeted marketing and individualized healthcare plans.</li>
    <li>The use of AI in industries such as education and finance will become more widespread.</li>
    <li>AI will continue to blur the line between human and machine, raising ethical questions about the role of robots in society.</li>
   </ol>
