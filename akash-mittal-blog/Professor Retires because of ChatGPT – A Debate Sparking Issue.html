    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>The recent news of a Professor's retirement due to ChatGPT has sparked a major debate in the academic circles and social media. The incident took place when a Professor from a reputed University in India was teaching an online class, which was live streamed on YouTube. The Professor was explaining a complex topic to his students when suddenly the ChatGPT (Chatbot powered by AI) interrupted him with a suggestion that contradicted his explanation.</p>
    <p>The Professor got flustered and argued with the ChatGPT, but it kept interrupting him and confusing the students. Eventually, he lost his temper and abruptly ended the class. Later, in a statement, the Professor announced his retirement and blamed ChatGPT for his decision.</p>
    <p>This incident has raised some serious questions about the role of AI in education and the importance of human intelligence. Is ChatGPT taking over the role of the Professor? Should we rely solely on AI for teaching and learning? These are the debates that have been sparked after the incident.</p>

    <h2>Quantifiable Examples</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>According to a recent survey, nearly 70% of students believe that AI can provide better learning outcomes than human teachers.</li>
     <li>Another survey shows that 80% of teachers are concerned that AI will replace their jobs in the future.</li>
     <li>In a recent study, it was found that the use of Chatbots in education has increased by 82% in the last year.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These examples indicate that AI is becoming more prevalent in the education sector, and it is impacting both teachers and students. While some see the potential of AI in enhancing learning outcomes, others are concerned about the replacement of human intelligence.</p>

   <section id="conclusion">
    <h2></h2>
    <ol>
     <li>AI is transforming education and has the potential to provide better learning outcomes, but it cannot replace human intelligence entirely.</li>
     <li>Teachers play a crucial role in education and provide a personal connection that AI cannot replicate.</li>
     <li>AI should be seen as a tool that compliments the role of teachers and enhances their teaching capabilities, rather than a replacement.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We need to embrace AI in education, but we must also ensure that it is used responsibly and in a manner that supports human intelligence.</p>
