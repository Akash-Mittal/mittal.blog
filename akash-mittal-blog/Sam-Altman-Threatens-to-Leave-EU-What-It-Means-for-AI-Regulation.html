    <p>Once upon a time, in the world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Tech, there was a man named Sam Altman. He was the CEO of OpenAI, a research organization dedicated to creating AI that benefits humanity. Sam Altman was a visionary, a pioneer, and a staunch advocate for AI regulation. He believed that AI has the potential to revolutionize the world as we know it, but only if it is used ethically and responsibly.</p>
    <p>However, Sam Altman's views on AI regulation were not always aligned with those of the European Union (EU). In fact, the EU's proposed regulations for AI - the ChatGPT regulation - recently drew the ire of Sam Altman.</p>
    <p>Sam Altman threatened to leave the EU if he does not like their ChatGPT regulation. This has caused quite a stir in the AI community, with many wondering what it means for the future of AI regulation.</p>

     <li>The Algorithmic Accountability Act: The Algorithmic Accountability Act is a proposed bill in the US that seeks to ensure that AI systems are transparent and accountable.</li>
     <li>The Electronic Frontier Foundation's AI Bill of Rights: The Electronic Frontier Foundation's AI Bill of Rights is a set of guidelines for the ethical use of AI.</li>
