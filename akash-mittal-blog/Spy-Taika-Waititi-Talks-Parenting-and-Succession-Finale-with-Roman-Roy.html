  <p>Roman Roy, played by Kieran Culkin, is one of the most complex and intriguing characters in the hit HBO series Succession. He is the youngest son of the Roy family and often seen as the black sheep of the family. His father, Logan Roy, sees him as a liability and is always ready to throw him under the bus. However, Roman's wit and charm make him a fan favorite among viewers. Recently, Taika Waititi, known for his work in films like Jojo Rabbit and Thor: Ragnarok, sat down with Kieran Culkin to discuss Roman's character and talk about parenting in the finale of Succession.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Waititi, who is also a father, started off the conversation by asking Culkin about his approach to parenting and how he deals with his children's behavior. Culkin revealed that he has a 3-year-old daughter and that he tries to understand her needs and wants. "I think the key to parenting is empathy," he said. "You have to put yourself in their shoes and try to understand where they're coming from. It's not about being permissive, but being compassionate."</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Waititi nodded his head in agreement and shared a personal anecdote about his own parenting style. "I have two daughters; one is 12 and the other is 5. I try to be involved in their lives as much as possible. When my oldest daughter was younger, I used to take her to the playground every day after school. We would talk about her day and what she learned. It was a way for us to connect and bond."</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The conversation then shifted to Roman's character and his relationship with his father. Culkin revealed that he had a lot of fun playing Roman and that he enjoyed exploring the different layers of his character. "Roman is a complex character. He's the youngest of the family and has always been overshadowed by his siblings. He tries to make his mark in the family business but is constantly reminded that he's not good enough."</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Waititi agreed and said that he saw a lot of himself in Roman. "I come from a big family, and I was always getting compared to my siblings. It can be tough to find your place in that environment," he said.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The two then discussed the season finale of Succession and the shocking twist that left viewers on the edge of their seats. Culkin revealed that he was just as surprised as the viewers when he first read the script. "I was blown away. I had no idea that was coming. It's a testament to the writers and the show's ability to keep the audience guessing."</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Waititi added that he loved the unpredictability of the show. "Succession is one of those shows that keeps you on your toes. You never know what's going to happen next, and that's what makes it so exciting."</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The conversation ended with Waititi asking Culkin what advice he would give to parents who are struggling to connect with their children. Culkin's answer was simple: "Just be present. Spend time with them, listen to them, and try to understand them. It's not about being perfect, it's about being there."</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Empathy is key to parenting - try to understand your child's needs and wants.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Creating an environment where your child feels heard and respected is important in building a strong relationship.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Being present and spending time with your child is essential in building a connection and fostering a loving relationship.</p>
