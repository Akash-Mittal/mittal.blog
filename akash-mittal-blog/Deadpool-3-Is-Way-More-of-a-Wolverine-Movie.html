    <p>The Deadpool franchise has been a huge success since the first movie was released in 2016. Ryan Reynolds' portrayal of the foul-mouthed, wisecracking anti-hero has won over fans all over the world. However, fans have been eagerly awaiting news about the next installment of the franchise, and it seems like we finally have some answers.</p>
    <p>In a recent interview with MovieWeb, Rob Liefeld, the creator of the character Deadpool, revealed that Deadpool 3 was going to be more of a Wolverine movie. He explained that the upcoming movie would focus on the relationship between Deadpool and Wolverine and that the two characters would have a lot of screen time together.</p>
    <p>This news has been met with both excitement and skepticism from fans. Some are thrilled to see the two iconic characters sharing the screen together, while others worry that this could be a ploy to capitalize on the popularity of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine character.</p>

    <p>While we don't have any details about the plot of Deadpool 3, we can look at some examples of how the two characters have interacted in the past. In the comics, Deadpool and Wolverine have a complicated relationship. They have fought each other numerous times, but they have also teamed up to take on common enemies.</p>
    <p>One example of their dynamic was in the comic series "Enemy of the State." In this story, Wolverine is brainwashed and sent on a killing spree by the evil organization Hydra. Deadpool is sent to take out Wolverine, but instead, the two end up teaming up to take down Hydra.</p>
    <p>Another example is in the comic series "Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe." In this story, Deadpool sets out to kill every character in the Marvel Universe, including Wolverine. However, when he confronts Wolverine, he realizes that he cannot kill him because he sees him as a father figure.</p>
    <p>These examples show the complex relationship between the two characters. While they may not always get along, there is a level of respect and understanding between them.</p>
