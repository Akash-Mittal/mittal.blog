  <p>Have you ever heard of cryptominers? They are people who use powerful computers to solve complex mathematical problems and earn digital currencies like Bitcoin. In recent years, cryptomining has become a lucrative business, but it also consumes a lot of electricity. And that's where President Biden comes in.</p><!-- Real life examples with hyperlinks -->
  <p>Under Biden's proposed tax plan, cryptominers would have to pay a 30% tax on their power bills. This is because the government wants to incentivize companies to use more renewable energy sources and reduce carbon emissions. Some of the main companies in the cryptomining industry include:</p>
