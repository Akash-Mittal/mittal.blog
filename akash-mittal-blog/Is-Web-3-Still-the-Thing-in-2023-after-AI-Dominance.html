   <h2>The Rise of Web 3 and AI</h2>
   <p>In 2017, the term "Web 3" was coined to describe the next iteration of the internet. It was envisioned as a decentralized, open web that puts users in control of their data and online identity. Fast forward to 2023, and the concept of Web 3 is still relevant, but it has been overshadowed by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
   <p>AI has been transforming industries and changing the way we interact with technology. From chatbots to self-driving cars, AI is becoming ubiquitous in our lives. The dominance of AI has prompted some to wonder if Web 3 is still relevant in this new technological landscape.</p>
   <h2>Real Life Examples</h2>
   <p>Despite the rise of AI, there are still plenty of examples of companies and technologies that embrace Web 3 principles. One such company is Brave, a privacy-focused web browser that removes ads and trackers. Another example is Ethereum, a blockchain platform that enables decentralized applications (dApps) to run on its network.</p>
   <p>There are also companies that are combining AI and Web 3 technologies to create new innovations. One such company is Fetch.ai, which is creating a decentralized marketplace for AI and machine learning algorithms. By leveraging Web 3 principles, Fetch.ai is able to provide a more secure and transparent marketplace for developers and buyers.</p>
