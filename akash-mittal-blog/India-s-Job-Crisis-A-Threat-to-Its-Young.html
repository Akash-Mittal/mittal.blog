    <ol>
     <li>India's job crisis is real, and it is affecting its young population the most.</li>
     <li>The government needs to both create jobs and address the skills gap in the labour force.</li>
     <li>Young people need to take a proactive approach to skill-building and entrepreneurship.</li>

    <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
    <p>Take the case of Smita, a young woman from a rural area in Maharashtra. She completed her bachelor's degree in arts and was determined to find a job in the city. However, she faced several challenges, including language barriers, discrimination, and a lack of networks. Frustrated, Smita decided to start her own business selling handmade crafts. Today, she is running a small but successful enterprise and is an inspiration to many other young people like her.</p>
    <p>Similarly, the story of Shyam, a mechanical engineer from Tamil Nadu, highlights the need for upskilling and reskilling. Despite graduating from a top university, Shyam struggled to find a job in his field. He then decided to take online courses in data analytics and machine learning, and soon landed a job at a top tech firm.</p>
