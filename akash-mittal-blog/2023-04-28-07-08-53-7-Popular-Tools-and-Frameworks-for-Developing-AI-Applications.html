  <main>
   <p>Developing AI applications has become a trend worldwide. The technology is advancing at an unimaginable pace, and it is crucial to keep up with the latest tools and frameworks. For instance, image recognition has become a hot topic in the tech industry in recent years. Let's say you are on a night out, and you're unsure whether the dish on your plate contains gluten. You can solve this problem with an AI-powered app that recognizes gluten-containing foods using an image from your phone camera.</p>
   <p>However, building such an app from scratch is not an easy task. Here are the seven most popular tools and frameworks for developing AI applications that we recommend:</p>
   <ol>
    <li><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://caffe2.ai/">Caffe2</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://keras.io/">Keras</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/">Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/developer/">NVIDIA Deep Learning SDK</a></li>
   </ol>
   <p>These tools and frameworks have different strengths and weaknesses, depending on your needs. TensorFlow is an excellent choice for those wanting to train neural networks, while PyTorch is a popular choice for natural language processing. Caffe2 is suitable for developing apps that require real-time video analysis, such as virtual assistants. Keras is a high-level library that is easy to use and has great community support. Scikit-learn is excellent for data scientists, while the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit is ideal for developers building deep learning applications. The NVIDIA Deep Learning SDK is a go-to choice if you're running experiments that need maximum performance.</p>
   <p>To illustrate, let's take a look at a few real-life examples:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.tesla.com/">Tesla</a> uses TensorFlow to develop its self-driving cars.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/siri/">Apple</a> uses PyTorch for Siri's natural language processing capabilities.</li>
    <li>The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi Foundation</a> uses scikit-learn to teach children about machine learning.</li>
    <li>The team behind <a href="https://www.watson.ibm.com/">IBM Watson</a> uses Keras to build its deep learning models.</li>
    <li>The <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> team uses the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit to develop its space exploration robots.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/deep-learning-performance/index.php">NVIDIA</a> uses its Deep Learning SDK for autonomous driving simulations.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>In conclusion, AI tools and frameworks are the backbone of modern software development. The seven we have discussed are just the tip of the iceberg, and there are many others. Remember to choose the tool that best fits your specific needs. AI development has a promising future, and we should take full advantage of it.</p>
   <h3>Critical Comments:</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>One common frustration among developers is the steep learning curve and difficulty tweaking models to fit specific use cases. However, new tools and platforms are emerging that may simplify the process.</li>
    <li>The lack of standardization in the AI industry poses a challenge for developers, making it difficult to switch between tools and frameworks.</li>
    <li>Finally, it is essential to note that AI is still in its early stages, and the technology is constantly evolving. Hence, developers must keep themselves updated with the latest trends to stay ahead of the curve.</li>
