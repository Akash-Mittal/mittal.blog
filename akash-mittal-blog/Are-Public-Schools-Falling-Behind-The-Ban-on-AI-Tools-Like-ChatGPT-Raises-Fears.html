    <h2>An Eye-Opening Story</h2>
    <p>Imagine a scenario where two high schools in the same city are preparing their students for college. On one side, there's a public high school where teachers are struggling to manage 35-40 students in a classroom. With limited budgets, class sizes are getting bigger and bigger, which makes it tough for the teachers to give each student the individual attention they need. On the other side of town, there's a private high school where classes are capped at 20 students, and each classroom has an AI-powered chatbot that helps students learn and get personalized feedback.</p>
    <p>Soon, the students from both schools will write the same standardized test. But how can these schools compete with each other when the playing field is so uneven? This is the reality we're faced with as public schools continue to struggle with limited resources while private schools utilize cutting-edge technology to stay ahead.</p>

   <h2> the Issue</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>In September 2021, a public school in Ontario, Canada banned the AI-powered tool ChatGPT, citing concerns over student privacy and data usage. This decision left teachers and students struggling to find alternative resources to supplement learning.</li>
    <li>A survey conducted by the National Education Association in the United States found that 94% of teachers in low-income schools face challenges with technology access and integration, compared to only 54% of teachers in high-income schools.</li>
    <li>According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the average class size in public schools in the United States was 21 students in the 2017-2018 school year. However, in urban areas, the average class size can exceed 25 students per class.</li>
    <li>A report by EdTech Digest found that 78% of teachers believe technology is a powerful tool to enhance learning, but only 36% of teachers feel their school has adequate technology resources.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
   <p>Emma is a public high school teacher in a large city in the United States. She teaches English to students from diverse backgrounds, but struggles to give each student the individual attention they need due to class sizes often hitting 30 students. In contrast, her friend Rachel teaches at a private school just a few blocks away. Rachel's classrooms use AI-powered chatbots to help students learn and get personalized feedback on their writing, allowing her to focus more on individual instruction. Emma worries that her students might be falling behind when they don't have access to the same technological resources.</p>
   <p>David is a high school student in Ontario, Canada. His school recently banned ChatGPT, which David found incredibly helpful in writing assignments. With the tool, he was able to get instant feedback on his work and improve his writing skills. Now, he feels like his progress has been cut short, and he's unsure how to get the same level of feedback without access to an AI-powered tool.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Public schools need to address the issue of limited resources and the increasing student-to-teacher ratio.</li>
    <li>The ban on AI tools like ChatGPT in public schools highlights the growing technology gap between public and private schools.</li>
    <li>In order to close this gap, more funding and resources should be allocated to public schools so they can offer their students the same level of technological tools and resources that private schools can provide.</li>
