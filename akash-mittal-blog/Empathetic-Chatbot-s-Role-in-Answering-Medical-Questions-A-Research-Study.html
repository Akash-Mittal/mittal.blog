  <h2>An interesting story</h2>
  <p>Meet Mary, a 38-year-old woman who was diagnosed with hypertension a few months back. She was on medication, but there were certain changes in her body that she was not able to understand. She had some questions regarding her medication and side effects. She was feeling confused and helpless when she discovered an empathetic chatbot named "Sara" that could assist her with all her medical questions related to her medication. Chatting with Sara made her comfortable and confident.</p>
  <h2>Real-life examples</h2>
  <p>"Doctor on Demand" is a telemedicine company that uses empathetic chatbots to cater to its patients. They have a chatbot named "Sophie" that assists patients with their medical queries. Sophie uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand the patient's condition and offers solutions accordingly. The chatbot is available 24/7, which makes it easy for patients to contact them whenever they need assistance.</p>
  <p>"Your.MD" is another company that uses empathetic chatbots to answer medical queries. They have a chatbot named "Ada," which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide patients with possible causes of their symptoms. Ada has helped millions of people worldwide to understand their symptoms and seek medical assistance.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion or Summary or critical comments in 3 points</h2>
  <p>Empathetic chatbots have revolutionized the healthcare industry. Their ability to understand human emotions, language, and behavior has made them indispensable in assisting patients with their medical queries. They offer a personalized experience for patients, which makes them comfortable and confident. Empathetic chatbots save both time and resources for healthcare providers and patients alike. However, chatbots have their limitations and are not a substitute for medical professionals. Chatbots can offer advice and assistance, but they cannot replace a face-to-face consultation with a doctor.</p>
