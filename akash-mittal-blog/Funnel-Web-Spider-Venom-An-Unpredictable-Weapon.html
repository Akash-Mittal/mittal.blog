    <h2>A Deadly Encounter</h2>
    <p>It was a hot summer day and Sarah was enjoying a leisurely walk in her garden when she suddenly felt a sharp sting on her ankle. A few seconds later, she felt a burning sensation spreading through her leg and knew that something was wrong. She looked down and saw a small black spider crawling away. Horrified, she realized that it could be a funnel web spider, one of the deadliest spiders in the world.</p>
    <p>With trembling hands, Sarah called the emergency services and was rushed to the hospital. The doctors confirmed that she had been bitten by a funnel web spider and administered antivenom immediately. Thankfully, Sarah survived the encounter, but it left her with a deep fear of spiders and a curiosity about the venom that almost killed her.</p>

    <h2>The Unpredictable Venom</h2>
    <p>A recent study conducted by a team of Australian researchers has shed light on the variability of funnel web spider venom. The study found that the venom of the funnel web spider can differ depending on the spider's location, diet, and age.</p>
    <p>For example, funnel web spiders that live in urban areas have more toxic venom than those in rural areas. This is likely due to the fact that urban spiders are exposed to more environmental pollutants and toxins, which they incorporate into their venom. Similarly, funnel web spiders that feed on insects have less toxic venom than those that feed on larger prey, such as small mammals. This is because they need to immobilize their prey quickly, rather than kill it slowly with potent venom.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the study found that the venom of juvenile funnel web spiders is less potent than that of adult spiders. This is believed to be because juvenile spiders have not yet developed the complex venom cocktails of their adult counterparts.</p>

     <h3>Funnel Web Spider Anatomy</h3><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1571731269247-28b76ea57977?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=500&amp;q=80" alt="Funnel Web Spider Anatomy">
     <p>Funnel web spiders are large, black spiders that are found in Australia. They are named for their distinctive funnel-shaped webs, which they use to trap their prey.</p>
     <ul>
      <li>Length: up to 5 cm (2 in.)</li>
      <li>Weight: up to 50 g (1.8 oz.)</li>
      <li>Lifespan: up to 20 years</li>
      <li>Location: Eastern coast of Australia</li>
     </ul>

     <h3>Funnel Web Spider Venom</h3><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1519831172222-2646564e3340?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=500&amp;q=80" alt="Funnel Web Spider Venom">
     <p>The venom of the funnel web spider is highly toxic to humans and other animals. It contains a mix of neurotoxins, which can cause paralysis, and enzymes, which can break down tissue.</p>
     <ul>
      <li>LD50: 0.14 mg/kg (injected)</li>
      <li>Symptoms: muscle spasms, sweating, increased blood pressure, vomiting, breathing difficulties, death</li>
      <li>Treatment: anti-venom</li>
     </ul>

     <h3>Famous Funnel Web Spiders</h3><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1519831803610-75e85251f93c?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=500&amp;q=80" alt="Funnel Web Spider">
     <p>Some of the most famous funnel web spiders include:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>Mouse spider (Missulena spp.): Not a true funnel web spider, but often confused with them due to their similar appearance and venom</li>
      <li>Trapdoor spider (Moggridgea spp.): Builds a burrow with a hinged trapdoor, which it uses to catch prey</li>
      <li>Tree funnel web spider (Hadronyche cerberea): Lives in the hollows of trees, where it builds its web</li>
     </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <div class="conclusion">
     <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>Funnel web spider venom can vary depending on the spider's location, diet, and age.</li>
      <li>Urban spiders have more toxic venom than rural spiders because of exposure to environmental pollutants and toxins.</li>
      <li>Juvenile spiders have less potent venom than adult spiders because they have not yet developed their full venom cocktail.</li>
     </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Although funnel web spiders are one of the deadliest spiders in the world, they play an important role in the ecosystem by controlling insect populations. However, it's important to be cautious around these spiders and seek medical attention immediately if bitten.</p>
