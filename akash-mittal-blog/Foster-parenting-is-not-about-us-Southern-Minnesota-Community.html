   <h2>Why fostering is about the children</h2>
   <p>At Southern Minnesota Community, we believe that fostering is not about us. It's about putting the needs of foster children first and foremost. This is a message we want to share with the community, and we feel that it's best illustrated through a true story:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>"I remember the day we first met our foster child. She was just five years old at the time and she had already been through so much in her short life. We knew that we had a lot to learn about how to care for her and make her feel safe and loved. We quickly realized that we had to put her needs above our own. It wasn't always easy, but over time we developed a deep bond with her and we knew that we were making a positive impact in her life."</p>

   <p>This story demonstrates the importance of keeping the focus on the children when fostering. Too often, foster parenting can be seen as a way to fulfill our own desire to have children or to do something charitable. However, the reality is that fostering requires a great deal of sacrifice and selflessness. Here are some quantifiable examples:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Foster children are more likely to thrive when their foster parents provide consistent routines and boundaries</li>
    <li>Foster parents often have to juggle doctor's appointments, court hearings, and social worker visits on top of their regular work and family responsibilities</li>
    <li>The average length of stay for a foster child is 2 years, meaning that foster parents often have to say goodbye to children they have grown to love and care for deeply</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Despite these challenges, fostering can be incredibly rewarding. Here are three reasons why:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Fostering gives you the opportunity to make a positive impact in a child's life</li>
    <li>You can learn valuable skills about parenting and empathy</li>
    <li>You can strengthen your community by helping to care for its most vulnerable members</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>How to keep the focus on the children</h2>
   <p>Here are some tips for keeping the focus on the children when fostering:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Remember that foster children have experienced trauma and may need extra patience and love</li>
    <li>Hold regular family meetings to discuss any concerns or issues that arise</li>
    <li>Stay in regular contact with the child's social worker to stay up-to-date on any important developments or changes</li>
    <li>Attend training sessions and support groups to learn more about how to provide the best care for your foster child</li>
    <li>Encourage your foster child to participate in extracurricular activities and to stay in touch with their biological family, if appropriate</li>
    <li>Practice self-care, whether it's taking time for yourself or seeking support from friends and family</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>At Southern Minnesota Community, we believe that fostering is a selfless act of love. It's not about fulfilling our own needs, but about providing a safe and stable environment for children who have experienced trauma. By keeping the focus on the children, we can make a positive impact in their lives and strengthen our community. If you're interested in becoming a foster parent, we encourage you to learn more about the process and to seek support from our community.</p>
