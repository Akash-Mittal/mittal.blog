    <p>Have you ever wondered how Hollywood creates those stunning visual effects and captivating storylines? Well, the secret is out - generative AI is taking the film industry by storm.</p>
    <p>Leading companies such as <a href="https://www.wetafx.co.nz/">Weta Digital</a>, <a href="https://www.pixar.com/">Pixar</a>, <a href="https://www.ilm.com/">Industrial Light &amp; Magic</a> and <a href="https://www.themill.com/">The Mill</a> have been experimenting with generative AI to create groundbreaking films and commercials.</p>
    <p>For example, Weta Digital used a combination of AI and traditional filmmaking techniques to bring the mythical world of Middle-earth to life in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. They created realistic landscapes, creatures, and battle sequences using AI algorithms that learned from vast amounts of data.</p>
    <p>Pixar, on the other hand, has been using AI to generate more complex and realistic character animations. They developed a system called "Arti", which leverages machine learning to create lifelike movements and facial expressions for their animated characters.</p>
