    <h2>The AI Boom and Its Impact</h2>
    <p>The AI boom is gaining momentum and is driving the growth in the chip stock market. The demand for AI-driven technologies has surged globally, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. According to Statista, a leading provider of market and consumer data, the AI market size worldwide is expected to rise from 9.5 billion US dollars in 2018 to 118.6 billion US dollars by 2025.</p>
    <p>The massive growth of the AI market has triggered the demand for chips that power the AI technologies. It has propelled semiconductor companies to invest heavily in research and development, with an aim to meet the high demands for AI technologies. Investors who have invested in chip stocks are starting to reap the rewards of the AI boom. For instance, in June 2021, Nvidia Corp.'s share price hit an all-time high of $745.44, driven by its strong AI-related product lineup.</p>
    <p>The AI boom is also creating opportunities for new entrants to enter the market. Smaller semiconductor companies specializing in AI chip designs, such as Cerebras Systems, are making their way into the chip stock market.
