  <h1>Mum's Warning: Baby Suffers "Margarita Burn" from Eating Celery in Sun</h1> <img src="images/Mum-s-Warning-Baby-Suffers-Margarita-Burn-from-Eating-Celery-in-Sun.jpeg" alt="+Mum-s-Warning-Baby-Suffers-Margarita-Burn-from-Eating-Celery-in-Sun+">
  <p>Australian mother, Lucy Burke, is warning parents to be extra cautious when feeding their children celery in the sun after her nine-month-old son, Oliver, experienced what she calls a "margarita burn" on his face and body.</p>
  <p>The incident occurred during a family picnic where Oliver had been munching on some celery sticks. Unbeknownst to Lucy, celery contains a chemical called psoralen that reacts with sunlight and causes skin irritation, similar to the effect of lime juice on the skin when drinking a margarita.</p>
  <p>"Oliver's face, arms, and chest were covered in a red rash and blisters, and he was clearly in a lot of pain. We rushed him to the hospital where they confirmed he had suffered a severe sunburn reaction caused by the celery," says Lucy.</p>
  <p>According to the American Society for Photobiology, psoralens are found in some plants and can cause phototoxic reactions when exposed to UV radiation. Other foods that contain psoralens include lemons, grapefruit, parsley, and figs.</p>
  
  <p>The dangers of psoralen exposure are not well-known to the general public, but they can have serious consequences, especially for young children. In fact, a study published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology found that up to 10% of people who ingest psoralen and are exposed to UV radiation can develop skin inflammation, blisters, and pigmentation changes.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, a report from the World Health Organization revealed that psoralen exposure can also lead to long-term health effects, including an increased risk of skin cancer and premature aging of the skin.</p>
  <h2> and Practical Tips</h2>
  <p>Lucy's warning has prompted other parents to come forward with similar experiences, highlighting the need for greater awareness of psoralen exposure in food. Here are a few tips to help protect your children from "margarita burn" and other phototoxic reactions:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Avoid feeding your children psoralen-containing foods like celery, parsley, and figs if they will be exposed to direct sunlight.</li>
   <li>During outdoor outings, apply sunscreen with at least SPF 30 on your child's face and body, and reapply every two hours.</li>
   <li>If your child experiences a reaction to a certain food or drink, especially if it includes sun exposure, seek medical attention immediately.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>"As parents, we want to give our children healthy and nutritious foods, but we also need to be aware of the potential risks and take the necessary precautions. I hope my story can help other families avoid the pain and trauma that Oliver went through," says Lucy.</p>
