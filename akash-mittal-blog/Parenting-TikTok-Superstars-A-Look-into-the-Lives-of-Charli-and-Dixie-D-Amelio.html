  <p>Heidi D'Amelio never thought her daughters, Charli and Dixie, would become the superstars they are today on TikTok. But with their combined following of over 160 million followers, the sisters have become household names and have ultimately changed the course of their family's life.</p>
  <p>One day, Heidi was scrolling through her Instagram feed when she stumbled upon a video of her daughters dancing on TikTok. As a former model and stay-at-home mom, she didn't know much about the platform, but quickly realized the potential.</p>
  <p>"I saw that they had like 70,000 followers and I was like, 'What?!' And then like, a week later it was a million. And then it was two million, and it just kept going up," Heidi said in an interview with WFSB News.</p>
  <p>The D'Amelio sisters have since become one of the biggest sensations on TikTok, known for their dance videos and relatable content. But with fame and fortune comes new challenges for both the sisters and their parents.</p>
