    <p>Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies have transformed the way we think about money. These digital assets have shown us a glimpse of the future, where transactions can be instantaneous, affordable, and secure. However, as more people use blockchain technology, the need for scalability and interoperability becomes increasingly crucial. That's where zkSync comes in.</p>
    <p>zkSync is a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum that uses zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to perform off-chain transactions while maintaining the same level of security as on-chain transactions. Since its mainnet launch in June 2021, zkSync has been making steady progress in terms of adoption, usage, and capabilities. Here are the three major milestones that zkSync has achieved so far:</p>
    <ol>
     <li><strong>1 million+ transactions per day:</strong> As of August 2021, zkSync has surpassed one million transactions per day, making it one of the most active Layer-2 solutions on Ethereum. This milestone demonstrates zkSync's ability to handle high traffic and provide fast and cheap transactions for users.</li>
     <li><strong>Integration with Polygon:</strong> In July 2021, zkSync announced its integration with Polygon, a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum. This partnership enables users to transfer assets between zkSync and Polygon, providing greater liquidity and accessibility for both ecosystems.</li>
     <li><strong>Launch of Version 2:</strong> In September 2021, zkSync launched Version 2 of its protocol, which features several improvements over its predecessor. Some of the new features include: 
      <ul>
       <li>Bigger batch sizes for greater efficiency</li>
       <li>Improved user experience with a new wallet interface</li>
       <li>Support for USDC and several other ERC-20 tokens</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ol>
    <p>These milestones show that zkSync is not just a promising solution, but a viable one that is making significant progress in the crypto ecosystem. As more developers and users adopt zkSync, we can expect to see even more growth and innovation in the months and years ahead.</p>
