    <h2>The Future is Here</h2>
    <p>Picture waking up one day and realizing that your robot just brewed your perfect cup of coffee without asking. Or looking out your window to see a self-driving car passing by. These are not just scenes from a sci-fi movie, they are a part of our reality today.</p>
    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the world as we know it. It has already transformed many industries, such as healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing, and the impact on our daily lives will only grow stronger in the coming years.</p>
   </section>
   <section id="examples">
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>AI is already being used in a wide range of applications. Here are just a few examples:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Personal assistants like Siri and Alexa use natural language processing to understand and respond to our commands.</li>
     <li>Google's DeepMind has been able to beat human champions in complex board games like Go.</li>
     <li>AI-powered drones are being used for search and rescue missions and environmental monitoring.</li>
     <li>Smart homes equipped with AI can automate tasks and make our living spaces more comfortable and energy-efficient.</li>
    </ul>
   </section>
   <section id="conclusion">
    <h2>The Future of AI</h2>
    <p>The future of AI is exciting and full of possibilities, but it also poses a number of challenges that we need to address. Here are three key takeaways:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>AI will transform the job market and reshape the way we work. It is estimated that up to 40% of jobs may be replaced by automation in the next 15 years.</li>
     <li>We need to ensure that AI is developed ethically and with human values in mind. This includes issues such as bias, transparency, and accountability.</li>
     <li>We need to keep pushing the boundaries of what is possible with AI. There is still so much we don't know about this technology, and with the right research and development, we could unlock its full potential to solve some of the world's biggest challenges.</li>
    </ol>
