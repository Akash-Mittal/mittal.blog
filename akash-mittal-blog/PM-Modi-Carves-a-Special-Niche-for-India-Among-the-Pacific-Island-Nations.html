   <p>India has always held a special place in the hearts of the people of the Pacific Islands. However, for many years, India's engagement with these nations was limited and sporadic, with little to no sustained effort to strengthen ties. But all of that changed when Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014.</p>
   <p>During his first visit to Fiji in 2014, PM Modi announced a significant increase in India's aid to the region from $125 million to $200 million over the next five years. He also pledged to increase cooperation in areas such as trade, investment, and renewable energy. Since then, India has continued to build strong ties with the Pacific Island nations, carving out a niche for itself as a trusted partner and a friend.</p>
