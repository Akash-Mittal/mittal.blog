  <main>
   <p>Imagine walking into your favorite clothing store and having the ability to design your own outfit with just a few clicks of a button. You can choose the colors, the patterns, and even the fabric. All of this is made possible thanks to generative AI.</p>
   <p>Generative AI is a technology that helps machines to learn and create something new by using vast amounts of data. It has the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work, and many industries are already taking advantage of its capabilities.</p>
   <h3>Real Life Examples</h3>
   <p>One company that is leading the charge in generative AI is Autodesk. They have created a software tool called Dreamcatcher that is capable of generating thousands of design options based on specific parameters which are set by designers. This tool can be used across a range of industries, including architecture, engineering, and manufacturing.</p>
   <p>Another example of generative AI in action can be seen at The Grid, a website building platform that uses AI to design custom websites. Users simply input their content, and the AI does the rest, creating unique designs that are tailored to each individual customer.</p>

   <h3>Conclusion</h3>
   <p>Generative AI is changing the game for businesses in many ways, from automating tasks to creating new product designs. While there are still some limitations to the technology, it is clear that we have only scratched the surface of its potential.</p>
   <p>As we move into a more AI-driven future, it is important to stay aware of the potential consequences and implications of this technology. The use of generative AI will undoubtedly lead to new opportunities, but it also raises important ethical questions that need to be addressed.</p>
