    <h2>An Interesting Story</h2>
    <p>As a long-time fan of fantasy novels, and an even longer-time fan of Henry Cavill, I was ecstatic when Netflix announced their adaptation of The Witcher. The first season was great, albeit a bit confusing at times, and the second season had some exciting moments... but, unfortunately, I think it's time to say goodbye to Geralt of Rivia and the rest of the gang.</p>

    <h2>Concrete Examples</h2>
    <p>The recent announcement that season 3 will be the last is not surprising, but it is disappointing. And, from what we've seen in the teaser, it looks like the writers are going to cram as much as possible into these final episodes. This approach often leads to rushed character development, plot holes, and unsatisfying conclusions.</p>
    <p>And then there's the backlash from Henry Cavill fans, who have vowed to boycott the show after rumors that he will be recast for future seasons. This would be a huge mistake on Netflix's part, as Cavill's portrayal of Geralt has been one of the highlights of the series.</p>
    <p>But it's not just the potential recasting that's causing problems. The show has already strayed far from the source material, making changes that were unnecessary and often detrimental. And while I understand the need to adapt for a visual medium, there are some things that just shouldn't be messed with.</p>
