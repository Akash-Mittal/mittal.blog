    <h2> Prompt Injection Vulnerabilities</h2>
    <p>Prompt injection is a type of cyber attack, which involves inserting a malicious command into a legitimate prompt message, in order to trick the user into providing sensitive information or executing harmful actions.</p>
    <p>YouTube transcripts are particularly vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, due to the nature of its coding system. The following are some quantifiable examples of prompt injection vulnerabilities on YouTube:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Over 20% of YouTube videos with transcripts contain at least one prompt injection vulnerability (source: https://www.checkmarx.com/2017/08/28/youtube-transcripts-vulnerable-prompt-injection-attacks/)</li>
     <li>A typical prompt injection attack on YouTube transcripts can compromise user data within minutes, and can result in significant financial losses (source: https://www.techradar.com/news/youtube-transcripts-vulnerable-to-prompt-injection-attacks)</li>
     <li>As of 2021, more than 3 billion people use YouTube regularly, making it a prime target for cyber attacks (source: https://www.oberlo.com/blog/youtube-statistics)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These examples demonstrate the severity of prompt injection vulnerabilities on YouTube transcripts, and the need for users to protect themselves against such attacks.</p>
