  <h2>Ramp's Mission</h2>
  <p>Ramp was created with the aim of helping businesses save money by automating their expense management. Its AI-powered tools are designed to detect wasteful spending and help businesses redirect their funds towards growth and expansion. The company's core values revolve around transparency, simplicity, and integrity.</p>
  <h2>Ramp's Latest Launch: An AI-Powered Savings Tool</h2>
  <p>Ramp recently announced the launch of a new AI-powered savings tool for businesses. The tool uses machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data from a company's expenses and identify opportunities for savings. It then provides recommendations on how to cut costs without sacrificing quality.</p>
  <p>The savings tool is already making a difference for businesses. One company, for example, was able to save over $10,000 per month on its food and beverage expenses alone, thanks to recommendations from the tool. Another company was able to save over 20% on its legal fees by switching to a more cost-effective provider.</p>
  <h2>How the Savings Tool Works</h2>
  <p>The Ramp savings tool works by analyzing a company's expenses over time. It uses machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and opportunities for savings. For example, it may detect that a company is spending more than it needs to on office supplies or travel expenses. It may also identify areas where the company is overpaying for services or subscriptions.</p>
  <p>The tool then provides recommendations on how to save money in these areas. For example, it may suggest using a different service provider or negotiating a better deal with an existing vendor. It may also recommend changes in policies, such as implementing a more stringent approval process for certain expenses.</p>
  <h2>The Benefits of Using an AI-Powered Savings Tool</h2>
