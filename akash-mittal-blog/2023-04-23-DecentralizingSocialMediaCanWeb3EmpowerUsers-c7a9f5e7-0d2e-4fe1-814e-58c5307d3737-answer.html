   <p>Once upon a time, there was a social media platform that was loved by millions of users. However, as the platform grew bigger, it became more centralized and started to prioritize profit over user experience. The algorithms became more biased, the censorship increased, and users had no control over their data. This was the turning point when Web3 entered the scene to empower the users.</p>
   <p>Web3 is the next evolution of the internet that brings decentralization and security to the forefront. With Web3, users have the power to control their online identities and data without relying on centralized platforms. It enables peer-to-peer interactions, smart contracts, and decentralized applications (DApps) that can transform the way we socialize online.</p>
   <h2>Concrete Examples of Web3 Empowering Users</h2>
   <ol>
    <li><b>Steemit:</b> Steemit is a blogging platform that rewards users with cryptocurrency for their content. It operates on a decentralized blockchain network, making it immune to censorship and manipulation. This gives content creators the power to earn money for their work without any middlemen.</li>
    <li><b>Minds:</b> Minds is a social media platform that values user privacy and free speech. It uses blockchain technology to secure user data and incentivizes users for their engagement. This gives users the power to communicate ideas freely without fear of censorship or data breaches.</li>
    <li><b>LBRY:</b> LBRY is a decentralized content sharing network that enables users to publish, share, and sell their digital content. It operates on a peer-to-peer network, making it immune to centralization and censorship. This gives creators the power to control their creations without intermediaries.</li>
