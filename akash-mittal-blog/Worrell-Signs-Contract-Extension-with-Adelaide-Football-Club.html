  <h1>Worrell Signs Contract Extension with Adelaide Football Club</h1> <img src="images/Worrell-Signs-Contract-Extension-with-Adelaide-Football-Club.jpeg" alt="+Worrell-Signs-Contract-Extension-with-Adelaide-Football-Club+">
  <p>It was a sunny day in Adelaide when young defender Fischer Worrell arrived at Adelaide Football Club's headquarters to sign a contract extension. The 20-year-old, who had played six AFL games, was all smiles as he put pen to paper on a new deal that will keep him at the club until the end of the 2024 season.</p>
  <p>It was a great moment for the young player, who had worked hard to earn his spot in the team. But it was also a sign of the faith the club had in him, and the potential they saw in him as a player.</p>
  <h2>The Rise of Fischer Worrell</h2>
  <p>Worrell was born in Adelaide and grew up playing for local club Golden Grove. He was picked up by Adelaide in the 2018 AFL Draft, and spent his first season playing in the SANFL.</p>
  <p>In 2020, he made his AFL debut, and impressed with his athleticism, courage and composure under pressure. He went on to play six games for the season, before a foot injury cut short his campaign.</p>
  <p>Despite the setback, the club knew they had a promising player on their hands. They worked closely with Worrell during his recovery, and he returned to pre-season training in great shape.</p>
  <p>As the 2021 season got underway, Worrell forced his way into the side with some strong performances in the SANFL. And when injuries struck the backline, he was given his chance in the AFL.</p>
  <p>He has played nine games so far this season, and has become an integral part of the team's defence. His height, speed and leap make him a difficult opponent for forwards, and his ability to get to contests and read the play have earned him praise from fans and teammates alike.</p>
  <h2>The Stats Behind The Player</h2>
  <p>While football is not just about stats, they can help to give a sense of a player's impact on the game. Here are some of the numbers that highlight Worrell's potential:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>85% disposal efficiency in his AFL career so far</li>
   <li>Average of 3.5 marks and 4.5 intercept possessions per game in 2021</li>
   <li>Ranking in the top 10% of AFL players for one-percenters</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These numbers show that Worrell is not just a promising prospect, but a player who is already making a difference at the highest level. And at just 20 years of age, he has plenty of scope to improve and become a real star of the competition.</p>
  <h2>What This Means for Adelaide Football Club</h2>
  <p>For Adelaide, securing the services of Worrell is a major coup. The club has had its ups and downs in recent years, but has a young and talented list that is beginning to gel.</p>
  <p>Players like Worrell are an important part of that future, bringing energy, enthusiasm and skill to the team. With his signature secured, the club can look to build around him and other young stars like Lachlan Sholl, Chayce Jones and Harry Schoenberg.</p>
  <p>It's also a strong message to the rest of the competition that Adelaide is serious about its rebuild. By locking in a player like Worrell, the club is showing that it has a plan for the future, and is willing to invest in the players who can help make that plan a reality.</p>
