    <h3>An Avalanche Story: Tragic and Terrifying</h3>
    <p>It was an ordinary winter day when a group of hikers decided to trek the steep mountainous terrain of the Kullu Valley region in Northern India. The scenic beauty of the snow-clad mountains was a sight to behold. They clicked pictures, shared laughs and traced their way through the winding paths. But little did they know that the mountains were silently plotting a deadly strike.</p>
    <p>Suddenly, without any warning, a loud roaring noise echoed through the valley. The hikers turned around to see a massive wall of snow rolling down towards them at an alarming speed. It was an avalanche ï¿½?? a natural disaster that can be fatal in just a few seconds.</p>
    <p>While a few of the hikers managed to move away in time, others couldn't escape the wrath of the snow. Four hikers were buried under the white cover, and it took hours of struggle for the rescue team to finally find them. Unfortunately, none of them survived.</p>

    <h3>The Avalanche Impact on Industries</h3>
    <p>Avalanches can be deadly for both humans and animals. They can cause massive damages to infrastructure, road networks, railways, and transportation in general. The tourism industry is one of the most affected by avalanches. Ski resorts, hotels and local businesses in the mountainous areas are forced to shut down when avalanche warnings are issued. This can lead to a severe loss of revenue, affecting the local economy adversely.</p>
    <p>Another industry that is impacted by avalanches is the mining industry. Mines located in the mountainous regions of the world face increased risks of avalanche. The loss of machinery, infrastructure and mining operations can cost the industry millions of dollars.</p>
    <p>Many companies have taken steps to mitigate the risk of avalanches. One such company is Swiss company, GeoTechnology, which provides solutions for managing natural hazards such as rockfall and avalanches. Their products, such as rockfall and debris flow barriers, protect infrastructure and people from avalanches and other natural disasters.</p>

    <h3>Critical Comments on the Avalanche Issue</h3>
    <ol>
     <li>The loss of human life and economic damage cause by avalanches is a serious issue that needs more attention and action.</li>
     <li>Industries that rely on mountainous regions need to take more measures to mitigate the risk of avalanches.</li>
     <li>Governments and non-profits organizations should take more active involvement in the promotion of research and development in the field of avalanche mitigation and warning systems.</li>
