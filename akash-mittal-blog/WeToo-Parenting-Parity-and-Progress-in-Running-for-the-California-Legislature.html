   <p>It was a sunny Tuesday afternoon in California, and Maria was in a hurry to pick up her three kids from school. As she entered the school premises, she noticed that another mother, also in a hurry, left her child's lunchbox behind. Maria quickly grabbed the lunchbox and ran after the mother, calling her name. The other mother turned around and thanked Maria for finding the lunchbox, giving her a quick hug. As Maria went to leave, one of her campaign flyers fluttered to the ground, with an image of Maria and her young family smiling and waving to potential voters.</p>
   <p>Maria is one of many mothers who have decided to run for the California Legislature, and as a result, representation in California is changing for the better. In the past, the California Legislature has been dominated by men, but we are now witnessing a shift towards increased representation for women, and particularly mothers, in government and politics.</p>
   
   <p>The progress we are seeing in California towards a more equal and representative government is not just anecdotal. According to recent statistics, the California Legislature is now comprised of 30% women, the highest percentage of any state legislature in the nation. This increase in representation is due in part to efforts by organizations such as Emerge California and Run Women Run, which work to train and support women in seeking elected office.</p>
   <p>Moreover, the presence of mothers in politics is becoming increasingly visible. One of the most prominent examples is California Senator Kamala Harris, who has two young stepchildren. She has spoken publicly about the importance of affordable childcare, and has advocated for paid family leave. Another example is Senator Holly Mitchell, who is a mother of one, and has been a champion for policies that support low-income families and communities of color.</p>
   <h2>Be the Change You Want to See</h2>
   <p>Mothers in politics are not only changing the face of the California Legislature, but also the policies that affect families and children across the state. By bringing their personal experiences and perspectives to the table, they are pushing for policies that are more inclusive, and will better serve the diverse needs of Californians.</p>
   <p>"I ran for office because I could not sit idly by and watch policies that failed to promote equity for our children and families," said Assemblywoman Buffy Wicks, who is also a new mother. "I knew that it was critical to have a mother's voice in the legislature, someone who had firsthand experience with issues like affordable healthcare, paid leave, and quality early childhood education."</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The increasing number of mothers and women in elected office is a positive development for California. By bringing diverse perspectives to government, they are helping to create a more equitable and representative society. If you are a mother who is interested in running for elected office, consider joining organizations like Emerge California or Run Women Run, which provide training and advice for women seeking office. Remember, success is not just about winning an election; it's about improving the lives of your community through policy change.</p>
