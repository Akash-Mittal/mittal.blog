  <p>The legal system is complex, and it is challenging to navigate without legal counsel.

  <p>The number of people seeking legal advice from chatbots has increased in recent times. Unfortunately, it has also resulted in a rise in legal malpractice cases. According to a report, an estimated 10% of people who receive legal advice from chatbots end up with legal issues due to incorrect advice.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, a survey found that more than 75% of people who received legal advice from ChatGPT did not have their issues resolved. Many of them ended up getting sanctioned or fined. These statistics show that chatbots like ChatGPT should not be trusted for legal advice.</p>
