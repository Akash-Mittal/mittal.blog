     <p>It was an exciting qualifying session at Monte Carlo for the Formula 3 race, with Min taking a commanding pole position. The young driver had been consistently quick throughout the practice sessions, but no one expected him to be so dominant in qualifying.</p>
     <p>Min's lap time of 1:20.732 was well ahead of his closest rival, who was more than half a second behind. The rest of the grid was even further back, with the top ten being separated by more than a second.</p>
     <h2>Quantifiable examples</h2>
     <p>Min's pole position is not just impressive because of the margin by which he took it, but also because of the track record he broke. The previous record, set by a Formula 1 driver in 2018, was 1:23.738. Min's lap time was more than three seconds faster!</p>
     <p>But it's not just the lap time that's impressive. The Monte Carlo street circuit is known for being one of the most challenging tracks in the world, with narrow roads, sharp turns, and unforgiving barriers. To be able to drive at such high speeds and with such precision in these conditions is a testament to Min's skill and courage.</p>
     <h2>Conclusion</h2>
     <div class="conclusion">
      <ol>
       <li>Min's pole position is a remarkable achievement that demonstrates his driving ability and potential.</li>
       <li>The lap time and track record he broke show that he is not just quick, but also capable of pushing the limits of what is possible on the track.</li>
       <li>We look forward to seeing how Min performs in the race, and what the future holds for this talented young driver.</li>
      </ol>
