    <p>As a doctor, you never know who will walk through your doors. One day, it could be a child with a runny nose, the next it could be an elderly person with chest pain. But what if you had a sidekick to help you diagnose your patients? That's where ChatGPT comes in.</p>
    <p>ChatGPT is a medical diagnosis AI chatbot that helps doctors diagnose their patients quickly and efficiently. By asking patients questions about their symptoms, ChatGPT is able to analyze the data and provide doctors with a list of potential diagnoses.</p>
    <p>Real life examples of ChatGPT include doctors using the technology in remote clinics to diagnose patients in rural communities. They are able to gather data from patients without even seeing them face-to-face. Another example includes ChatGPT being used in emergency rooms to triage patients. Nurses are able to use the system to quickly determine which patients need to be seen by a doctor immediately and which can wait.</p>
