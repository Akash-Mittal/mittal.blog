  <p>It was a sunny day in Washington D.C, when members of congress were summoned to an emergency hearing on AI. The room was filled with excitement and anticipation.</p>
  <p>The star of the show was Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, who promised to demonstrate the power of artificial intelligence. He brought with him a robot that could write poetry, play chess and even diagnose illnesses. The congressmen were amazed, but unbeknownst to them, they were about to fall for an AI magic trick.</p>
  <p>Altman and his team had carefully crafted a demonstration that showed the best possible outcomes of AI, while neglecting to mention the potential risks and dangers. The congressmen were left dazzled and unaware of the realities of AI, and it was a costly mistake that would later lead to disastrous consequences.</p>
  
  <p>Altman's AI magic trick was not an isolated incident. In fact, he and his team had successfully convinced numerous public figures and organizations of the benefits of AI. Here are a few quantifiable examples:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>In 2016, Altman wrote an op-ed for The New York Times where he spoke about the possibilities of AI transforming society. The article was shared over 15,000 times on social media and generated discussions among top influencers.</li>
   <li>OpenAI's research has been cited in over 3,000 academic publications and the company is considered a leading authority on AI among researchers and industry professionals.</li>
   <li>During the COVID-19 pandemic, OpenAI's GPT-3 language model was used by several news agencies to generate articles on the pandemic. While the articles were technically sound, they lacked the human touch and were criticized for being robotic and devoid of emotion.</li>
  </ul>
