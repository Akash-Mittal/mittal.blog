    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>Summer Walker, the R&amp;B singer known for hits like "Playing Games" and "Come Thru," recently opened up about her experiences with postpartum depression and single parenting. In an interview with <em>People</em> magazine, she talked about the challenges she faced after giving birth to her daughter, who is now three months old.</p>
    <p>"It was just really hard," Walker said. "I didn't love being pregnant, and I didn't really have a good support system during the pregnancy, so that kind of set me up for a weird postpartum experience. I was feeling really down, and I was just trying to figure out how to be a mom."</p>
    <p>Walker went on to describe how she struggled with everyday tasks like changing diapers and making bottles, and how she felt isolated and alone during those early days of motherhood. "It was just really rough," she said. "I felt like I was failing my daughter every day."</p>
    <p>Despite these challenges, Walker eventually found her footing as a new parent, and she credited her daughter with helping her get through those difficult times. "She's my motivation," she said. "She's the reason why I get up every day, and I'm just in love with her."</p>

    <p>Walker's story is not unique. In fact, postpartum depression affects up to 1 in 7 women in the United States, according to the American Psychological Association. And single parents, like Walker, face additional challenges. Here are some quantifiable examples:</p>
    <ol>
     <li><strong>Financial Strain:</strong> Single parents are more likely to live in poverty than any other demographic group. In 2019, the poverty rate for single-parent families was 35.2%, compared to 7.3% for married-couple families, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</li>
     <li><strong>Childcare Costs:</strong> Childcare is a major expense for single parents. In many cases, the cost of childcare can exceed the parent's income. For example, in California, the average cost of infant care is $16,412 per year, while the median income for single mothers is $26,000.</li>
     <li><strong>Mental Health:</strong> Single parents are at increased risk for mental health issues, including depression and anxiety. In one study, single parents were more likely to report symptoms of depression than parents who were married or cohabiting.</li>
    </ol>
