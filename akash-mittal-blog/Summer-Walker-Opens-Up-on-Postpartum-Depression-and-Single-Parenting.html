  <p>Summer Walker, known for her R&amp;B hits like "Girls Need Love" and "Playing Games," recently opened up about her struggles with postpartum depression and being a single parent in an interview with Rolling Stone.</p>
  <p>Walker revealed that after giving birth to her daughter last year, she experienced intense feelings of sadness and anxiety that she couldn't shake.</p>
  <p>"I felt like I was in a deep hole," Walker told Rolling Stone. "I didn't want to get out of bed, I didn't want to eat, I didn't want to do anything. It was really scary."</p>
  <p>Postpartum depression affects up to 20% of new mothers, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The condition can cause feelings of sadness, anxiety, and exhaustion that interfere with daily life.</p>
  <p>Walker's experience is not uncommon, but as a celebrity, she is in a unique position to raise awareness about a condition that is often stigmatized.</p>
  <h2>The Impact of Postpartum Depression on Single Parenting</h2>
  <p>For Walker, being a single parent has made her experience of postpartum depression even more challenging.</p>
  <p>"It's hard because I don't have anyone to lean on," she said. "I have to do everything myself, and it's overwhelming sometimes."</p>
  <p>Single parents, especially those who don't have a strong support system, may be more vulnerable to postpartum depression, according to a study published in the Journal of Women's Health. The study found that single mothers were more likely to experience depressive symptoms in the first year after giving birth than married or cohabiting mothers.</p>
  <p>Walker's experience highlights the need for better support for single parents, both in terms of mental health services and practical assistance with childcare and household chores.</p>
  <h2>Practical Tips for Coping with Postpartum Depression</h2>
  <p>If you are a new mother experiencing postpartum depression, there are steps you can take to cope with your symptoms:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Reach out to a healthcare provider or mental health professional for help. Medication and therapy can be effective in treating postpartum depression.</li>
   <li>Lean on your support system. Talk to trusted friends or family members about how you are feeling and ask for their help when you need it.</li>
   <li>Take care of yourself. Eat a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and make time for self-care activities that you enjoy.</li>
   <li>Avoid isolating yourself. Join a support group for new mothers or connect with other mothers online.</li>
  </ul>
