  <p>Why silence and censorship hinder understanding and trust: reflections on Covid origin debate in China's chat apps</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>It was a sunny afternoon in May when Chen, a 32-year-old IT engineer from Shanghai, logged into his favorite chat app, QQ, to join a group discussion about the latest news on Covid. As he scrolled the messages, he noticed that one of the members, who had been active and vocal before, suddenly stopped responding. Confused, he sent a private message and asked what happened. To his surprise, he received no reply, but saw that the person had left the group and disappeared from his contacts.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Chen wondered why his fellow chat mate vanished. He remembered that the person had recently posted a message expressing doubts about the official narrative that the virus originated from a wet market in Wuhan. Instead, the person speculated that the virus might have escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan. Chen knew that such views are sensitive as they challenge the credibility of the Chinese government and the leadership of the Communist Party. He himself did not have a firm opinion on the origin of the virus, but he valued free speech and open debate. He felt uneasy that someone who expressed a different view was punished by exclusion and isolation.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Chen's experience is not unique in China, where chat apps are popular and ubiquitous. According to a recent survey by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, more than 688 million people use mobile chat apps, which account for almost 90% of the total time spent on mobile internet. The apps allow people to form groups and exchange messages, photos, videos, and voice recordings instantly and privately, without the need for face-to-face interaction or even real identities. While such convenience and privacy facilitate the expression of diverse opinions and emotions, they also enable the spread of misinformation, rumors, and hate speech, and create echo chambers that reinforce stereotypes and biases.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The Covid origin debate in China's chat apps illustrates both the potentials and the pitfalls of digital communication. On one hand, the apps have allowed some netizens to challenge the official narrative and seek alternative sources of information and analysis. Thanks to the global reach of the internet, they can access foreign media, scientific reports, and social media platforms that might offer different perspectives and evidence. They can also share their own experiences and observations, and thus contribute to the collective understanding of the pandemic's impact on various regions, communities, and individuals.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>For example, some chat users have questioned the timing and accuracy of the official data released by the Chinese government on the outbreak in Wuhan. They have cited reports from foreign media that suggested the virus might have existed in other parts of China or the world earlier than December 2019, when the first cluster of cases was identified in Wuhan. They have also pointed out the inconsistencies and contradictions in the official accounts of the wet market theory, such as the absence of direct animal-to-human transmission links, or the presence of virus traces in sewage samples collected before the market was closed.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>On the other hand, the apps have also revealed the fragility and vulnerability of free speech and open debate in China, where the government has a history of censorship, propaganda, and control over the media and the internet. Despite the fact that the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization have conducted joint investigations and published reports that support the wet market theory and find no evidence of laboratory leaks, some chat users dispute the validity and objectivity of these sources, and insist on their own theories without providing solid evidence or rationale. Some of them also resort to insults, threats, and other forms of harassment and intimidation against those who disagree with them, or against the moderators who try to enforce basic rules of civility and rationality.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>For example, some chat users have accused the moderators of being paid agents of the government or foreign interests, or of being brainwashed by the official media. They have also attacked the moderators personally, using derogatory language or revealing their personal information, such as their names, photos, or addresses. Some moderators have reported receiving death threats or being harassed by anonymous callers or text messages. Some have also been banned by the app operators themselves, who may act to avoid legal troubles or political pressure.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>What can we learn from these conflicting dynamics of the Covid origin debate in China's chat apps? Here are three points of reflection:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Free speech without responsibility and accountability can harm the public interest and erode trust: While we should respect the right to express diverse opinions and challenge the official narrative, we should also be aware that such rights come with duties and risks. We should try to base our claims on verifiable facts, logical reasoning, and scientific methods, and be open to updating and revising our views in light of new evidence and arguments. We should avoid spreading rumors, falsehoods, or hate speech that might cause harm to ourselves or others. We should also be willing to accept critique, correction, and feedback from others, and engage in civil and constructive dialogue and debate.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Censorship and exclusion without transparency and accountability can also harm the public interest and erode trust: While we may encounter views and voices that we find disagreeable or offensive, we should not resort to censorship, exclusion, or other forms of control without clear and justified reasons, and without offering a space for appeal and redress. We should try to understand the underlying motives, needs, and fears of those who express different views, and engage in empathetic and respectful communication and interaction. We should also be transparent about our own biases, values, and interests, and seek to balance them with the needs and interests of the wider society and the common good.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Digital communication can amplify both the potentials and the pitfalls of human social behavior: While the chat apps offer a fast, convenient, and flexible way to connect with others and exchange information and views, they also challenge our ability to handle diversity, complexity, and uncertainty. We should be aware that the apps are not neutral or objective platforms, but embedded in the social and cultural contexts of their users and operators. We should also be aware that the apps have limitations and biases that may affect the quality and accuracy of the information and views shared on them, and that may create filter bubbles, echo chambers, and polarization. We should therefore try to complement our digital experiences with offline communication and interaction, and with critical thinking and media literacy skills.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, the Covid origin debate in China's chat apps highlights the urgent need for a more nuanced, constructive, and empathetic approach to digital communication that can foster understanding, trust, and collaboration in a globalized and complex world. We should not be complacent with simplistic dichotomies of right or wrong, true or false, but rather seek to engage in a dialogue that respects the diversity, complexity, and uncertainty of the issues at stake. We should also be aware that the pandemic is not only a health crisis, but also a social, economic, and cultural challenge that requires collective efforts and solidarity. We should therefore strive to transcend our personal and group interests, and work towards a common goal of building a more resilient, inclusive, and sustainable world.</p>
