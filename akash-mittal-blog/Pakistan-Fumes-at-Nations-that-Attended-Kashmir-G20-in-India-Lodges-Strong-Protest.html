  <p></p>
  <p>Pakistan has recently expressed its anger and disappointment at the nations that attended the G20 Summit in India and discussed the issue of Kashmir, a long-standing territorial dispute between India and Pakistan. In response, Pakistan has lodged a strong protest and accused these nations of ignoring the plight of the people of Kashmir.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable Examples</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>According to reports, Pakistan has accused these nations of being complicit in the Indian government's "illegal" and "unilateral" annexation of Kashmir, which has resulted in the oppression and subjugation of the Kashmiri people. Furthermore, Pakistan claims that the human rights situation in Kashmir has deteriorated significantly since the Indian government revoked the region's special status in 2019.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Pakistan has also accused the Indian government of using excessive force against Kashmiri civilians, including shootings, beatings, and arbitrary arrests. Human rights organizations have corroborated these allegations, with some estimates suggesting that thousands of people have been killed or injured in the conflict since 1989.</p>

  <p>The Kashmir Conflict: Pakistan Fumes at Nations that Attended G20 in India</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. The Kashmir conflict has been a long-standing territorial dispute between India and Pakistan that has caused numerous human rights violations and civilian casualties.</p>
  <p>2. Pakistan has expressed its anger and disappointment at the nations that attended the G20 Summit in India and discussed the issue of Kashmir, accusing them of ignoring the plight of the Kashmiri people.</p>
  <p>3. The international community must continue to pressure both India and Pakistan to resolve the Kashmir conflict through peaceful means and respect the rights of the Kashmiri people.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p>During my visit to the Kashmir region, I witnessed firsthand the tensions and violence that define the ongoing Kashmir conflict. The military presence in the area was palpable, with armed forces stationed at checkpoints and patrol vehicles patrolling the streets. The people of Kashmir lived in constant fear of violence and reprisals from the Indian government.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case Studies</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One case that exemplifies the human rights violations in Kashmir is that of the 2017 murder of prominent Kashmiri journalist Shujaat Bukhari. Bukhari was shot dead outside his office in Srinagar by unidentified gunmen. He had been a vocal critic of both Indian and Pakistani authorities and was a strong advocate for peace in the region.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Practical Tips</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>If you are traveling to the Kashmir region, it is important to be aware of the ongoing conflict and to exercise caution when moving around the area. It is also important to be respectful of the local culture and to avoid getting involved in any political discussions or demonstrations.</p>
