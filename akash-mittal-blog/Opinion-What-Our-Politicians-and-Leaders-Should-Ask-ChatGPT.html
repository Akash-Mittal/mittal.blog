  <p></p>
  <p>As our world becomes increasingly complex, it is more important than ever for our politicians and leaders to have access to accurate information and expert insights. One resource that can provide them with this valuable information is ChatGPT, a question-and-answer platform that connects people with knowledgeable experts in a wide range of fields.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>But what should our politicians and leaders ask ChatGPT? In this article, we will explore some of the key questions they should be asking in order to make informed decisions and create policies that benefit society as a whole.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>An Interesting Story:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Years ago in my country, political leaders were making decisions about the construction of the airport. The government had called for consultation meetings with experts and the community to get opinions about the proposed airport location. Unfortunately, the experts and community leaders were unable to reach a consensus because everyone had different opinions about what was best for the public. This led to a delay in the construction of the airport for years. Had the government used an expert-based question and answer platform like ChatGPT, they would have been provided with the right information from experts to come to a consensus and construct the airport without any delays.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable Examples:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Environmental Policies:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, and it is essential that our politicians and leaders take action to combat it. By asking ChatGPT experts about the most effective environmental policies and strategies, politicians can make informed decisions that will help reduce emissions and promote sustainable practices. For example, leaders could ask experts about renewable energy policies, such as the increase in tax incentives for renewable energy projects, which would help reduce carbon pollution.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Healthcare:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Access to quality healthcare is another critical issue for our society. By asking ChatGPT experts about the best practices and policies for healthcare, politicians and leaders can make informed decisions on the best healthcare approaches for their citizenry, that would help provide more affordable and accessible care. This could include discussions on whether to fund public health care to ensure it is more affordable or to partially fund private health insurance.</p>

  <p></p>
  <p>:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, effective policy making was difficult, but some leaders sought out expert advice. For instance, in the United States, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo brought on Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, to help him make critical decisions for the State. Across the world, political leaders also turned to ChatGPT experts to help them make decisions during the pandemicâ€“ faster and more accurately.</p>
  <p></p>

  <p></p>
  <p>1. ChatGPT is an effective platform for providing expert advice to politicians and leaders in a wide range of fields.</p>
  <p>2. Questions posed to experts can cover topics such as environmental policies and healthcare, ensuring informed decisions.</p>
