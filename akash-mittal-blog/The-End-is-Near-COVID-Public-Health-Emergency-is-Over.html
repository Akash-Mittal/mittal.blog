   <section>
    <p>It was a typical Tuesday afternoon when the announcement came. The public health emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was officially over.

    <p>For many, this news was met with mixed emotions. On one hand, people were relieved that the worst was over. They could finally go out, meet their loved ones, and resume their normal lives. On the other hand, people were cautious. They knew that the virus was still out there, and they had to take necessary precautions to avoid getting infected.</p>
    <p>The road to recovery was long, arduous, and at times, felt never-ending. But here we are, on the cusp of returning to normalcy. So, what can we expect in the coming days, weeks, and months?</p>

    <h2> the Return to Normalcy</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>Travel restrictions have been lifted in many countries, leading to a surge in tourism. According to the World Tourism Organization, international tourist arrivals are expected to increase by 50% in 2021 compared to 2020, but still 48% lower than pre-pandemic levels in 2019.</li>
     <li>Restaurants, bars, cinemas, and other entertainment venues have reopened, leading to a spike in sales. According to Mastercard SpendingPulse, retail sales in the US rose by 26.3% in April 2021 compared to the same month last year, and e-commerce sales grew by 19.2% YoY in March 2021.</li>
     <li>Unemployment rates are declining in many countries, as businesses reopen and people return to work. In the US, the unemployment rate fell to 5.8% in May 2021, down from 14.8% in April 2020.</li>

    <h2>What Does the Future Hold?</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>Continued Vigilance: While the worst may be over, we still need to be cautious. The virus is still out there, and it's important to follow guidelines on physical distancing, wearing masks, and washing hands to minimize the risk of getting infected.</li>
