   <h2>A Growing Trend</h2>
   <p>AI startups with no business plan are receiving billions of dollars in funding from investors. It seems that the promise of AI is so great that investors are willing to take a risk on these companies, even if they have no clear plan for monetization.</p>
   <p>This trend has been observed in many different industries, from healthcare to finance to retail. For example, one company called OptumIQ is focused on using AI to help healthcare providers improve patient outcomes. Despite not having a clear revenue model, the company has raised over $100 million in funding.</p>
   <p>Similarly, Kavout is a financial technology startup that uses AI to analyze market data and make investment recommendations. Since its founding in 2016, the company has raised over $10 million in funding, even though it has yet to generate any revenue.</p>
   <h2>Why This is Happening</h2>
   <p>So why are investors so willing to pour money into AI startups with no business plan? One reason is the sheer potential of AI technology. The promise of AI is that it can enable companies to do things that were previously impossible, from predicting future outcomes to automating repetitive tasks.</p>
   <p>Another reason is the fear of missing out (FOMO). With AI being hailed as the next big thing in technology, investors are afraid of falling behind their competitors by not investing in these startups. Even if there is no clear path to profitability, investors are willing to gamble on these companies in the hopes that they will be the next big success story.</p>
   <h3>The Risks</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Investors could lose a lot of money on AI startups that ultimately fail to monetize.</li>
    <li>Companies that rely on AI technology may become too dependent on it, which could be a problem if the technology fails or produces inaccurate results.</li>
    <li>The hype around AI may lead to unrealistic expectations, which could ultimately hurt the industry if it fails to deliver on its promises.</li>
   </ul>
