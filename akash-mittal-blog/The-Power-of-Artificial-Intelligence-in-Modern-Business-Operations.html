    <h2>How AI is Revolutionizing Business Operations</h2>
    <p>Imagine you are the CEO of a large multinational corporation. You have hundreds of employees, thousands of customers, and millions of dollars in revenue. One day, you come to work and discover that your company's operations are in disarray. Your employees are overworked, customers are dissatisfied, and profits are plummeting. You are at a loss for what to do.</p>
    <p>Then, you hear about a new technology called artificial intelligence (AI). You learn that AI is designed to automate routine tasks and improve efficiency. You decide to implement AI into your company's operations.</p>
