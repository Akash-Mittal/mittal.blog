   <p>Boston Dynamics has taken a giant leap in making robotics more socially intelligent by equipping their four-legged robot dogs with ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence (AI) language model that is capable of generating human-like text.</p>
   <p>Before this development, these robodogs had limited capacity for communication and interaction with human beings. Although they were capable of performing advanced tasks such as running, climbing, and jumping, their ability to communicate in a human-like manner was somewhat lacking.</p>
   <p>However, with the introduction of ChatGPT, these robodogs will be able to communicate in real-time with humans, allowing for a more seamless interaction between human beings and these machines. The potential applications for these communication capabilities are enormous, especially in areas such as disaster relief, military operations, and law enforcement.</p>
   <p>One example of how these robodogs can be used is in search-and-rescue operations, where they can navigate through rough terrain and hazardous conditions to locate individuals in need of help. With ChatGPT, they can effectively communicate any pertinent information to their human counterparts.</p>
   <p>Anothe example of the usage of robodogs with ChatGPT is in military operations. These dogs can be used as scouts, detecting potential threats and transmitting information back to their human handlers. With ChatGPT, the information they transmit can be contextualized more effectively and help their human handlers make more informed decisions.</p>
   <p>Despite numerous advantages that the incorporation of ChatGPT has brought to the robodogs, concerns of the ethical use of such artificial intelligence cannot be ignored. Security concerns that the dogs may be hacked and used for malicious purposes is a serious liability, and companies that will utilize such technology must invest heavily in security measures that ensure ethical use.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, the integration of ChatGPT into these robodogs is an exciting development that has expanded the potential applications of these machines. With their new-found capability for effective communication, Boston Dynamics' robodogs might soon become an important part of many industries, serving as indispensable assistants to human beings.</p><a href="https://nypost.com/2021/10/15/chatgpt-wired-into-boston-dynamics-robodogs-so-they-can-speak/" target="_blank" class="btn">Reference</a>
