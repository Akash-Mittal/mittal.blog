  <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the latest buzzword in the tech industry. It has taken the world by storm and is revolutionizing the way businesses operate. You have heard of self-driving cars, facial recognition, and voice assistants, but there is more to AI than meets the eye. Before investing in AI, you need to be familiar with these four terms.</p>
  
  <p>In 2011, IBM's Watson defeated two of Jeopardy's greatest champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings. Watson is a computer system that uses natural language processing and machine learning to analyze and understand human language. It was able to decipher the clues and come up with the correct responses faster than the human champions. This victory was a remarkable achievement for AI and marked a turning point in the technology's development.</p>
  
  <p>1. Natural Language Processing: AI systems are trained to analyze and understand human language. This has many applications such as chatbots that can assist customers and virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa. Google's AI language model, BERT, has improved the accuracy of search results by understanding the context of a query.</p>
  <p>2. Computer Vision: AI systems can recognize images and videos, which is why facial recognition and self-driving cars are possible. Amazon's Rekognition service can detect and analyze objects, faces, and activities in images and videos.</p>
  <p>3. Machine Learning: AI can learn from data, identify patterns and make predictions. Netflix uses machine learning to recommend content to its users based on their watching history. Google's AlphaGo used machine learning to defeat the world champion at the game of Go.</p>
  <p>4. Robotics: AI-powered robots are used in factories, healthcare, and even in space exploration. Boston Dynamics' robot, Spot, is capable of dynamic movements like running, jumping, and dancing.</p>

  <h2></h2>
  <ol>
   <li>AI is not a single technology, but rather a collection of technologies that enable machines to simulate human intelligence.</li>
   <li>The four terms to know before investing in AI are natural language processing, computer vision, machine learning, and robotics.</li>
   <li>AI has already revolutionized industries like healthcare, finance, and transportation and is expected to create new job opportunities and drive economic growth.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
  <p>GPT-3, an AI-powered language model developed by OpenAI, was used to generate articles for The Guardian newspaper. The editors inserted a few paragraphs of text as a prompt, and GPT-3 wrote the rest of the article. The results were impressive, and the readers could not tell whether a human or a machine had written the article.</p>
