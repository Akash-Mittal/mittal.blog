    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>Have you ever come across a chatbot that seemed to be too good to be true? Maybe it had the perfect answers to your questions, and you couldn't tell if you were talking to a human or a machine. This happened to me recently, and it got me thinking about how we can distinguish humans from AI.</p>
    <p>As a writer and content creator, I spend a lot of time online, and I've seen my fair share of chatbots. Most of the time, it's easy to tell that you're not talking to a human. The responses are short and robotic, and there's not much emotion in the conversation. But every now and then, you come across a chatbot that seems to be different. It's engaging, it's empathetic, and it seems to understand what you're saying.</p>
    <p>That's what happened to me when I came across ChatGPT, an AI-powered chatbot that can help you with a variety of tasks, from writing prompts to grammar checks. As I chatted with ChatGPT, I started to wonder if I was really talking to a machine or a human pretending to be a machine.</p>
    <p>That's when I came up with the idea for the Capital Letter Test.</p>

    <p>The Capital Letter Test is simple. All you have to do is make a deliberate mistake and see how the chatbot responds. Here's an example:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Me: i'm looking for a writing prompt.</li>
     <li>ChatGPT: Sorry for the interruption! Here are some writing prompts:<br>
       - If you could travel back in time, what would you change?<br>
       - Write about a person you admire and why.<br>
       - Describe a place that brings you peace.<br>
       Do any of these spark your interest?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You see, I intentionally typed "i'm" instead of "I'm" to check if ChatGPT would catch it. And it did! It not only corrected my mistake but also apologized for the interruption and offered some writing prompts.</p>
    <p>Now, let's see what happens with a different chatbot:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Me: i'm looking for a writing prompt.</li>
     <li>Another Chatbot: Great! Here are some writing prompts:<br>
       - write about a time you were proud of yourself<br>
       - describe a place you've never been but would like to visit<br>
       - write about your favorite hobby<br>
       Which one do you want to try?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In this case, the chatbot didn't catch my mistake and simply continued with the conversation.</p>
    <p>Of course, this is not a foolproof method, and some chatbots may be programmed to respond to lowercase letters. But in general, the Capital Letter Test can help you differentiate between humans and AI.</p>
