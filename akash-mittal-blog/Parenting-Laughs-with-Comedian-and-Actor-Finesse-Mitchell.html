    <p>As parents, we all know that raising kids is no easy task. But who says it can't be funny? Comedian and actor Finesse Mitchell has a way of finding humor in the most challenging moments of parenting.</p>
    <p>One time, Finesse's daughter wanted him to play dolls with her. He tried his best to make it fun, but after a few minutes, he couldn't take it anymore and said, "You know what, sweetie, I gotta go." His daughter's response? "Well, okay, but make sure you get your purse before you leave."</p>
    <p>It's moments like these that Finesse shares on stage, in his book "Your Girlfriends Only Know So Much," and on his podcast "The Spirit Told Me To Tell You." His humor is not only relatable, but it also helps parents realize that they're not alone in the struggles and joys of raising their children.</p>
    
    <p>According to a survey conducted by The Bump, 90% of parents find humor in their baby's blowouts, 72% find humor in dealing with toddler tantrums, and 62% find humor in their teen's mood swings.</p>
    <p>Another study found that laughter can actually reduce stress levels and improve mood, which can be particularly helpful for parents who often feel overwhelmed and exhausted.</p>
    
    <p>One of Finesse's most memorable parenting moments was when his daughter forgot her lines for a school play. Instead of getting upset, Finesse improvised and was able to make the audience laugh. He even received a standing ovation. This experience taught him that sometimes, the unexpected can lead to great things.</p>
    <p>Another time, Finesse's daughter was having a sleepover with some friends. He overheard them talking about him and one of the girls said, "Your dad is pretty funny for an old guy." Finesse couldn't help but laugh, realizing that he was no longer the cool dad he once thought he was.</p>
