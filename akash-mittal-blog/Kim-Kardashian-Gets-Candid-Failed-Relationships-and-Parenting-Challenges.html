    <p>The Kardashians are known for their extravagant lifestyle, but behind the glitz and glamour, there's also a lot of hard work and challenges. Kim Kardashian, in particular, has been open about her struggles with failed relationships and parenting challenges.</p>
    <p>Kim's journey to finding true love has been a rollercoaster ride. She had two failed marriages before finally finding happiness with her third husband, Kanye West. In a candid interview with <em>Vogue</em>, she revealed that she had to learn a lot from her failed relationships.</p>
    <p>"I married for the first time when I was 19 and I knew within six months it wasn't for me," she said. "But I had to learn that I'll always have love for him and that I'll always have love for my previous relationships. I had to learn how to be myself, get my confidence back, and figure out what I wanted."</p>
    <p>Kim also spoke about how her parenting journey has had its own set of challenges, especially with raising her children in the public eye. She revealed that it's often hard to decide what to share and what to keep private, especially when it comes to criticism from the public.</p>
    <p>"I think about when my kids grow up and they see all of the foolish things I've done," she said. "I'll just say to them, â€˜I did the best I could with what I had.'"</p>
