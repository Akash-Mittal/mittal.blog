   <article>
    <p>It was a warm evening in downtown San Francisco when John, a tech enthusiast, was scrolling through his Twitter feed when he came across a tweet that would change his life. The tweet was from a popular tech guru who had just invested in an AI startup that was revolutionizing the healthcare industry. John, who had been following the progress of AI for years, was intrigued. He immediately searched for more information about the startup and came across their website. In less than an hour, John had invested a substantial amount in the company. Fast forward a year, and John's investment has tripled in value.</p>
    <p>John's success story is just one of many in the world of AI stocks. As AI continues to grow and become more ubiquitous, investors are clamoring to get in on the action. In fact, AI stocks have been some of the best performers in recent years. But is this growth sustainable, or are we in the midst of an AI bubble?</p>
    <h3>The Numbers Speak for Themselves</h3>
    <p>Let's take a look at some of the numbers. According to Forbes, the AI market is expected to reach $118.6 billion by 2025. That's a compound annual growth rate of 36.6% from 2020 to 2025. Additionally, AI startups received over $40 billion in funding in 2020 alone. This is a clear indication that investors are bullish on the future of AI and are willing to put their money where their mouth is.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the performance of AI stocks has been impressive. The S&amp;P 500's AI and Robotics ETF, which tracks the performance of companies involved in AI and robotics, has returned over 120% in the past year. This is significantly higher than the S&amp;P 500's overall return of 40% during the same period.</p>
    <h3>Why the Growth is Sustainable</h3>
    <p>So, what's driving this growth? One major factor is the continued development of AI technology. AI is no longer a futuristic concept; it's a reality that's being integrated into our daily lives. From voice assistants to self-driving cars, AI is becoming more and more ubiquitous.</p>
    <p>Another factor is the increasing demand for AI in various industries. Healthcare, finance, and retail are just a few examples of industries that are embracing AI to improve efficiency and reduce costs. As the benefits of AI become more apparent, we can expect to see even more industries adopt this technology.</p>
    <p>Finally, the pandemic has only accelerated the adoption of AI. With remote work becoming the norm, companies have had to rely on AI to streamline processes and maintain productivity. In fact, a recent report by Deloitte found that 55% of companies plan to increase their use of AI in the post-pandemic world.</p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>In conclusion, AI stocks are not in a bubble, but rather, they are poised for continued growth. The numbers speak for themselves, and the increasing demand for AI technology is a strong indicator that this growth is sustainable. However, as with any investment, it's important to do your due diligence and invest wisely.</p>
