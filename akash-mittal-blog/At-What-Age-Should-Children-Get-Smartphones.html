    <p>Smartphones have become ubiquitous in our lives, and it is increasingly common for children to own them. According to a survey by Common Sense Media, 53% of children in the United States own a smartphone by the age of 11. However, there is ongoing debate about what is the right age for children to have smartphones.</p>
    <p>In this article, we will explore this topic in depth, from an interesting story to quantifiable examples, and offer a conclusion in 3 points. We will also provide personal anecdotes and case studies, as well as practical tips for parents.</p>

   <section id="story">
    
    <p>Once upon a time, there was a mother who gave her 7-year-old daughter a smartphone. She thought it would be a great tool for keeping in touch with her daughter when she was at work, and for entertaining her during long car rides.</p>
    <p>However, the daughter quickly became addicted to the phone, spending hours on social media and playing games. She also became more withdrawn and less interested in playing outside or interacting with her family.</p>
    <p>The mother realized that giving her daughter a smartphone at such a young age was a mistake, and decided to take it away. She then did some research and found that many experts recommend waiting until children are at least 12 years old before giving them smartphones.</p>

   <section id="quantifiable">
    
    <p>There are several reasons why experts recommend waiting until children are older before giving them smartphones. Here are some quantifiable examples:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Smartphone addiction: Children who use smartphones excessively can develop addiction-like symptoms, such as withdrawal, cravings, and loss of control. According to a survey by Common Sense Media, 50% of teens feel addicted to their smartphones, and 59% of parents agree that their teens are addicted.</li>
     <li>Cyberbullying: Children who use smartphones are at risk of being cyberbullied, which can lead to depression, anxiety, and suicide. According to a study by the Cyberbullying Research Center, 34% of students in the United States have experienced cyberbullying.</li>
     <li>Sleep problems: Children who use smartphones before bed can have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep, which can lead to poor academic performance, mood problems, and obesity. According to a study by the National Sleep Foundation, 90% of teens say they use their smartphones in bed, and 95% of those say they check social media.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Expert Advice</h2>
    <p>So, what is the right age for children to get smartphones? While there is no one-size-fits-all answer, most experts agree that waiting until children are at least 12 years old is a good idea. Here are some reasons why:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Brain development: Children's brains are still developing until their mid-20s, and excessive smartphone use can interfere with this development. Waiting until they are older can help them develop better impulse control, decision-making, and social skills.</li>
     <li>Maturity: Children who are older are typically better able to handle the responsibilities and risks that come with owning a smartphone, such as managing data usage, avoiding inappropriate content, and staying safe online.</li>
     <li>Alternative options: There are other options for keeping in touch with children, such as texting, calling, and using parental control apps, that do not involve giving them a smartphone.</li>
    </ul>
