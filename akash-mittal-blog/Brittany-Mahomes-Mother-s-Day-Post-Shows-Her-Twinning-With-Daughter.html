   <h2>Quantifiable Examples</h2>
   <p>Research has shown that having a close relationship with your child can have many positive outcomes. For example:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Children with secure attachments to their parents are more likely to have better emotional regulation, self-esteem, and social competence (Source: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5475174/">National Center for Biotechnology Information</a>).</li>
    <li>Mother-child bonding has been linked to lower levels of stress hormones in both mothers and children (Source: <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/dec06/moments">American Psychological Association</a>).</li>
    <li>Moms who spend more time with their children are more likely to have kids who report feeling happy and loved (Source: <a href="https://www.parents.com/parenting/better-parenting/positive/happy-mom-happy-kids/">Parents</a>).</li>
   </ul>
   <p>These examples show that building a strong relationship with your child can have a positive impact on both of your lives.</p>
   <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
   <p>So how can moms cultivate a strong bond with their children? Here are some practical tips:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Make time for one-on-one activities: Whether it's going on a walk, playing a board game, or baking cookies together, setting aside dedicated time for just you and your child can help you connect.</li>
    <li>Show interest in your child's passions: If your child loves soccer, go to their games and cheer them on. If they love art, enroll them in a class or set up a craft station at home. Supporting their interests shows that you care.</li>
    <li>Communicate openly and honestly: Encourage your child to share their thoughts and feelings with you, and listen attentively without judgment. This can help build trust and understanding.</li>
    <li>Practice self-care: Taking care of yourself is also important for maintaining a strong bond with your child. When you feel happy and energized, you'll be better able to engage with them and enjoy your time together.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>By incorporating these tips into your daily routine, you can create a loving and supportive environment for your child.</p>
