  <p>As parents, we all want to do the best we can for our children. But sometimes, we may not know everything we need to know, and may need a little guidance and support.</p>
  <p>That's where the Calabar Infant and Primary Parenting Workshop comes in. Recently, several parents from the school attended a workshop aimed at helping them be the best parents they can be.</p>
  <h2>A Personal Story</h2>
  <p>One of the parents who attended the workshop, Jennifer, shared her personal story with us. Jennifer is a mother of three, and while she loves her children more than anything, she sometimes feels unsure about how to handle certain situations.</p>
  <p>For example, her middle child is particularly sensitive and easily upset. Jennifer sometimes struggles with knowing how to respond and help her child through these emotions.</p>
  <p>At the Calabar Infant and Primary Parenting Workshop, Jennifer found the support and guidance she was looking for. The workshop covered a variety of topics, including emotional intelligence, effective communication with children, and discipline strategies.</p>
  <p>Through the workshop, Jennifer gained a new perspective on how to handle her child's emotions, and felt empowered to try new approaches that could help her child feel more supported.</p>
  
  <p>The Calabar Infant and Primary Parenting Workshop has had great success in helping parents become more confident and effective in caring for their children. Here are some quantifiable examples:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>83% of parents who attended the workshop reported feeling more confident in their ability to communicate with their children</li>
   <li>78% of parents reported an increase in positive interactions with their children after implementing some of the strategies learned in the workshop</li>
   <li>94% of parents felt the workshop was a valuable resource and would attend again in the future</li>
  </ul>

  <h2> and Practical Tips</h2>
  <p>Another parent who attended the workshop, Michael, shared his personal anecdote with us. Michael's child had been struggling in school, and he felt at a loss as to how to help.

With this new approach, Michael was able to help his child improve their grades, and also fostered a stronger sense of motivation and confidence.</p>
