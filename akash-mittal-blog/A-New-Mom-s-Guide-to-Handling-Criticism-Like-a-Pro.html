  <p></p>
  <p>When I became a new mom, I thought I was ready for anything – the late nights, the endless feedings, the diaper changes. But one thing I wasn't prepared for was the constant criticism that came with my parenting decisions. From my choice of formula to the way I held my baby, it seemed like everyone had an opinion on how to take care of my child.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One incident that particularly stands out was when a stranger in the grocery store told me I was holding my baby wrong – only two days after I had given birth. I felt embarrassed and ashamed, but I was determined to not let it get to me. Over the next few months, I learned some valuable lessons on how to handle criticism like a pro.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Here are three tips for new moms on how to handle criticism:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Consider the source</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Before you take criticism to heart, consider the person who is giving it. Are they a parenting expert or just a nosy neighbor? Do they have experience with children or are they speaking from ignorance? Understanding where the criticism is coming from can help you put it into perspective.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>For example, if a fellow mom gives you advice on breastfeeding, you may want to take it to heart since she has experience in that area. But if a stranger criticizes your decision to bottle-feed, you can take it with a grain of salt since they don't know your situation.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Focus on the positive</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>It's easy to get bogged down with negative comments, but try to remember the positive feedback you've received as well. For every person who criticizes your parenting, there's likely someone who has praised your skills or offered encouragement. Keep these positive remarks in mind and use them as motivation to keep going.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Be confident in your choices</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>You know your child better than anyone else, and you are the one who will ultimately make the decisions that affect their lives. Trust your instincts and have confidence in your choices. Remember that there is no one right way to parent – what works for one family may not work for another.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, criticism can be tough to handle for any new mom. But by considering the source, focusing on the positive, and being confident in your choices, you can learn to handle it like a pro. Don't let other people's opinions bring you down – you are doing the best you can for your child.</p>
