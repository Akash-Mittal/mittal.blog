   <p>Every year, millions of people worldwide visit ophthalmologists to get their eyes checked. These exams are essential for diagnosing and treating a plethora of vision problems, but they are not always accurate. Researchers have been working for years to improve the accuracy of ophthalmology exams, but they are facing numerous challenges. However, recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) have brought new hope to this field.</p>

    <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
    <p>One company that is making significant strides in the field of AI-powered ophthalmology is ChatGPT. They have created a chatbot that can conduct ophthalmology exams using natural language processing (NLP). The chatbot asks patients a series of questions related to their vision, and then provides them with a diagnosis based on their responses.</p>
    <p>Another company that is making waves in this field is Eyenuk, which has developed an AI system that can detect diabetic retinopathy with a high degree of accuracy. The system uses deep learning algorithms to analyze retinal images and identify signs of the disease, which can lead to early intervention and treatment.</p>
