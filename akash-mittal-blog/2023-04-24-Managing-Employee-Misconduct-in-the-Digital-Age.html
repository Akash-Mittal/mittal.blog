    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>John was the CEO of a small tech company. He had a great team of young, dynamic employees who were committed to their work. However, one day he received a complaint from a client that one of his employees had posted offensive comments about the client on social media. John was shocked and thought he had hired the wrong person. But as he tried to investigate the matter, he realized that he had not provided any guidelines to his employees about the use of social media at work. This incident made him realize the importance of managing employee misconduct in the digital age.</p>
