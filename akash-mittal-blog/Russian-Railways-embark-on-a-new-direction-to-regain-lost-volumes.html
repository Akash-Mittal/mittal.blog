  <p>Story:</p>
  <p>The sound of the locomotive whistle echoed through the station as the train pulled up to the platform, ready to depart on its transcontinental journey from Moscow to Vladivostok. For generations, the Trans-Siberian Railway had been the backbone of Russia's transport system, connecting the vast nation from east to west. But in recent years, the once-proud railway has been losing ground to more nimble competitors. Russian Railways, the state-owned company that operates the network, has been facing decreasing volumes and increasing financial pressures, spurring a reorientation effort to regain lost ground.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable examples:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>- Russian Railways' freight volumes fell by 3% in 2020, compared to the previous year, due to the pandemic and geopolitical tensions in the region, according to the company's financial report.</p>
  <p>- The company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) decreased by 6 billion rubles ($82 million) in the same period.</p>
  <p>- Russian Railways' market share in the transportation of coal, iron, and steel products declined from 47% in 2014 to 44% in 2020, due to the emergence of alternative transport modes such as trucking and inland waterways.</p>
