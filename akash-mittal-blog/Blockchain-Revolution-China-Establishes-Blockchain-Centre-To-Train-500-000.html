  <p>Imagine a world where transactions are lightning fast, secure, and transparent. Imagine a world where governments, financial institutions, and businesses can work hand in hand without the need for middlemen or intermediaries. This world is not far-fetched. It already exists, and it is called the blockchain technology.</p>
  <p>The blockchain technology is the backbone of the digital currency, Bitcoin. It is a decentralized, public ledger that maintains a list of all Bitcoin transactions, without the need for a central authority to manage it. With the blockchain technology, Bitcoin users can send and receive funds without going through banks or financial institutions. As a result, Bitcoin transactions are faster, cheaper, and more secure than traditional banking transactions.</p>
  <p>As more and more people adopt the blockchain technology, there is a growing need for blockchain experts and developers. In China, the government has recognized this need and has established a Blockchain Centre to train 500 000 blockchain professionals.</p>
