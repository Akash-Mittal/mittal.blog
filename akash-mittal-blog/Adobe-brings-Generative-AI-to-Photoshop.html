   <h1>Adobe brings Generative AI to Photoshop</h1> <img src="images/Adobe-brings-Generative-AI-to-Photoshop.jpeg" alt="+Adobe-brings-Generative-AI-to-Photoshop+">
   <p>Photoshop has been the go-to software for digital artists, designers and photographers for decades, and now, thanks to Adobe's latest update, it's about to get a whole lot smarter. With the introduction of generative AI, Photoshop users will now be able to enhance and manipulate their images like never before.</p>

   <h2>Quantifiable examples</h2>
   <p>One practical example of how generative AI can be used in Photoshop is with the new Neural Filters feature. This feature allows users to apply a range of filters to their images, each of which is powered by artificial intelligence. For example, the Smart Portrait filter can automatically adjust facial features like the eyes, nose, and mouth to create a more flattering portrait. The Depth-Aware Haze filter can automatically create a depth map of the image and intelligently adjust the haze based on that map. These filters can save users hours of manual editing time, and the results are often stunning.</p>
   <p>Another example is with the Sky Replacement feature. With generative AI, Photoshop can now intelligently mask out the existing sky, and then automatically replace it with a new sky that matches the lighting and colors of the image. This can greatly enhance landscape and outdoor photos, and give users much more control over the final look of their images.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, with generative AI, Photoshop can intelligently scale images without losing quality. This means that users can take a low-resolution image and quickly increase its size without making it look pixelated or blurry.</p>

   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Generative AI is changing the game for Photoshop users, allowing them to spend less time on manual editing and more time on their creative vision.</li>
    <li>The new Neural Filters feature and Sky Replacement feature are just the beginning, and we can expect to see even more AI-powered tools in future Photoshop updates.</li>
    <li>While AI can certainly enhance our images, it's important not to rely on it too heavily. Creativity and artistry are still essential skills for any digital artist or designer.</li>
