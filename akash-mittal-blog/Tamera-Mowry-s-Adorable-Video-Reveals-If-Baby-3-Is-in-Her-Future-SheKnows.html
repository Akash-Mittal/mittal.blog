  <p>As fans of the Mowry sisters already know, Tamera Mowry is a devoted mother of two children, Aden and Ariah. She's also a beloved television personality and businesswoman. So when she released a video on Instagram in which she answers the question of whether she'll be having a third child, fans were eager to find out her response.</p>
  <p>In the video, Tamera stands surrounded by her children, holding a sign that reads "Baby #3," with an arrow pointing to herself. She then shakes her head no and mouths the words "no more." The video is accompanied by the caption, "I DON'T think you're ready for this one... Just had to share this. 😂."</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The video has been viewed over 380,000 times.</li>
   <li>It has received nearly 3,000 comments.</li>
   <li>The comments range from congratulatory to disappointed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Some fans expressed their pleasure at Tamera's decision to focus on the two children she already has and not rush into having a third. One Instagram user wrote, "Good for you! Take the time to enjoy the blessings you have without distraction. They grow up too fast! 👶🏽👦🏽👧🏽."</p>
  <p>Others were hoping to see Tamera expand her family even further, feeling that her children are so cute and would love the addition of another sibling. One comment read, "😭 but the Mowry/Housley babies are so cute! Honestly don't think there could ever be too many 😂."</p>
  <p>Regardless of fan reaction, what's clear is that Tamera is happy with the family she has built with her husband, Adam Housley. This decision to focus on her two current children is a reminder to parents that it's important to prioritize the family you have and enjoy them while they're young.

   <li>Set aside specific times during the week to be together as a family, whether it's for dinner, a movie night, or a family outing.</li>
   <li>Make an effort to spend quality one-on-one time with each child, even if it's just for a few minutes each day.</li>
