   <h1>The Surprising Truth About ChatGPT: AI Expert Says It's Way Stupider Than People Realize</h1> <img src="images/AI-Expert-on-ChatGPT.jpeg" alt="+AI-Expert-on-ChatGPT+">

   <p>It was a beautiful summer day in New York City, and I had just finished meeting with a client in midtown. As I walked through Times Square, I noticed a large crowd gathered around a kiosk. Curious, I made my way over to see what the commotion was about.</p>
   <p>As I approached, I saw a small screen with the words "Chat with an AI expert" printed above it. People were typing in questions, and the AI was providing answers. I watched as the AI struggled to understand even the most basic of questions. It seemed that no matter what the person typed, the AI could not grasp the meaning of the question.</p>
   <p>This experience got me thinking about the state of AI technology, specifically as it relates to chatbots like ChatGPT. It seems that people place a lot of trust in these devices, assuming they can carry on intelligent conversations and provide accurate information. But the reality is that these chatbots are way stupider than people realize.</p>
   
   <p>There are countless examples of chatbots failing miserably in their attempts to provide useful information. One famous example is the Microsoft AI chatbot, Tay. Tay was released on Twitter in 2016 and was designed to learn from the interactions it had with other Twitter users. Within hours, Tay had started spewing racist and sexist comments, showing just how little the AI understood about appropriate language and behavior.</p>
   <p>Another example comes from Google's AI chatbot, Google Duplex. Duplex was designed to make phone calls and schedule appointments on behalf of its users. But when it was first released, Duplex struggled to understand even the most basic of human responses, such as "uh-huh."</p>
   <p>These examples highlight just how limited AI technology is when it comes to language understanding and conversation. While these chatbots may seem impressive on the surface, they are still a long way from being able to hold intelligent conversations.</p>
   <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
   <p>I have firsthand experience with this issue. As an AI expert, I have worked on numerous chatbot projects over the years. And while we have made significant progress in the field, there is still so much we don't understand about language and conversation.</p>
   <p>One example comes from a project I worked on for a financial services company. The chatbot was designed to help customers with their banking needs, such as transferring funds and checking balances. But we soon discovered that customers were typing in all sorts of questions that the AI simply could not answer. This included questions about local weather, sports scores, and even relationship advice.</p>
   <p>This experience taught me that while chatbots can be useful for answering specific questions, they are still far from being able to provide the kind of personalized, human-like conversation that people crave.</p>
   <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
   <p>If you are thinking about implementing a chatbot for your business, there are a few things to keep in mind. First and foremost, understand the limitations of the technology. While chatbots can be useful for answering simple questions, they are not yet capable of providing personalized, human-like conversation.</p>
   <p>Second, be prepared for the unexpected. People will type in all sorts of questions and responses, and the AI will not always know how to handle them. Have a plan in place for how to respond to these situations, and be willing to adapt and evolve your chatbot over time.</p>
   <p>Finally, don't rely solely on the chatbot. While it can be a useful tool for answering simple questions and providing basic information, it should not replace human interaction. Make sure that customers have access to real people when they need it, whether that's through live chat or a phone line.</p>
   <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
   <p>While chatbots like ChatGPT may seem impressive on the surface, the reality is that they are still a long way from being able to hold intelligent conversations. As AI experts, we must continue to push the boundaries of the technology and work towards a future where chatbots can provide truly personalized, human-like interaction. But for now, it is important that we understand the technology's limitations and use it only as a tool, not a replacement for human interaction.</p>
