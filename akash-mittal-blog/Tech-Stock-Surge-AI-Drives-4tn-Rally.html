    <p>When Aaron was a child, he dreamed of becoming an astronaut. He read books about space travel, watched documentaries about the stars, and even had a telescope in his backyard. But as he grew older, he realized that his fear of heights and motion sickness would prevent him from ever leaving the Earth's atmosphere.</p>
    <p>However, Aaron's passion for technology never faded. He became an early adopter of AI, investing in companies that were harnessing the power of machine learning. And with the recent surge in tech stocks, Aaron's portfolio has grown exponentially, allowing him to support other space-related initiatives, like funding research into reusable rockets and lunar colonization.</p>
    <p>Aaron's story is just one example of how AI is changing the world, both in terms of technological advancements and financial opportunities.</p>

    <p>The $4tn rally in tech stocks can be attributed to the increased interest in AI, which has been growing at an astonishing rate. In 2020, global AI investments exceeded $40bn, according to Statista. By 2025, that figure is expected to reach $110bn, with the AI market estimated to be worth $190bn by 2025.</p>
    <p>One reason for this growth is the increased use of AI across industries, from healthcare to finance. The adoption of AI technology is expected to save $150bn annually for the healthcare industry alone, decreasing the time it takes to diagnose illnesses and improving patient outcomes. In finance, AI is being used to detect fraud and reduce risk, potentially saving companies millions of dollars in losses.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the use of AI in the workplace is expected to increase productivity by 40% by 2035, according to Accenture. This could lead to significant cost savings for businesses, as well as increased efficiency and innovation.</p>
