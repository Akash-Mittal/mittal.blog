   <p>Imagine you're a Mac user and you're looking for a chat app to keep in touch with your friends and family. You go to the Mac App Store and see a popular app called ChatGPT. You think it looks like a great choice and download it without a second thought.</p>
   <p>However, what you don't know is that ChatGPT is a fraudulent app that can potentially harm your computer and steal your personal data.</p>
   <p>Several Mac users have reported instances where they installed ChatGPT and then experienced problems such as excessive advertising, fake updates, and pop-ups. In some cases, the app even hijacked their Safari browser.</p>
   <p>The developers behind ChatGPT claim that the app is a legitimate chat platform. However, this couldn't be further from the truth. In reality, ChatGPT is a fake app developed by scammers posing as an online chat company.</p>
