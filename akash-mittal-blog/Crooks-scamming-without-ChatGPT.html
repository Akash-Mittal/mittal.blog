     <h2>The Story</h2>
     <p>ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence chatbot developed by cybersecurity firm Group-IB, has gained a lot of attention in recent years for its ability to detect and prevent online fraud. The chatbot uses machine learning algorithms to identify phishing attempts and other fraudulent activities and has been successful in saving millions of dollars for its clients.</p>
     <p>However, not all crooks are deterred by ChatGPT's capabilities. In fact, some are getting smarter and finding new ways to scam unsuspecting victims without even needing ChatGPT's help.</p>

    <section id="examples">
     <h2>Real-life Examples</h2>
     <p>One common technique is the use of fake websites which look like legitimate ones to trick people into giving away their personal information. For example, in 2018, a group of scammers created a fake website that looked like the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and sent phishing emails to millions of taxpayers, asking them to enter their Social Security numbers, addresses, and other sensitive details. The scammers were able to steal thousands of identities and file fake tax returns before they were caught.</p>
     <p>Another method is the use of social engineering tactics to gain the victim's trust and obtain their personal information. In 2019, a hacker targeted a cryptocurrency exchange and impersonated a high-profile investor, convincing the exchange's employees to reset the investor's password and provide access to their account. The hacker was then able to steal over $24 million worth of cryptocurrency.</p>
     <p>These are just a few examples of the many ways in which crooks are finding ways to scam victims without the help of ChatGPT or other cybersecurity tools.</p>
