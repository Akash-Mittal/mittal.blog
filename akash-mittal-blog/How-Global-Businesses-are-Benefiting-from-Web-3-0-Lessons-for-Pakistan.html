   <p>Imagine you're a farmer in rural Pakistan. You've got a bumper crop of wheat this season, but you have no way of selling it other than the local market. The middlemen who buy from you and sell to retailers take a huge cut, leaving you with very little profit. You wish there was a better way to sell your produce directly to buyers, without the need for middlemen.</p>
   <p>Enter Web 3.0. This new era of the Internet is set to revolutionize the way we do business, and it's already starting to happen. Web 3.0, also known as the decentralized web, is a new way of building and using online applications that uses blockchain technology and peer-to-peer networks to create a more open, transparent, and secure online environment. In this article, we'll take a look at how global businesses are already benefiting from Web 3.0, and what lessons Pakistan can learn from their successes.</p>
   <h2>Quantifiable Examples</h2>
   <p>One of the biggest benefits of Web 3.0 is the ability to create decentralized, peer-to-peer marketplaces. These marketplaces eliminate the need for middlemen and allow buyers and sellers to transact directly with each other. Take OpenBazaar, for example. This decentralized marketplace allows people to buy and sell goods and services without any intermediaries. Since its launch in 2014, OpenBazaar has facilitated over $15 million worth of transactions.</p>
   <p>Another example of Web 3.0 in action is Brave, a decentralized web browser that blocks ads and trackers and rewards users with cryptocurrency for viewing ads. Brave has over 10 million active monthly users and has paid out over $10 million worth of cryptocurrency to its users.</p>
