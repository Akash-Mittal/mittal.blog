    <p>Imagine you're sitting in a self-driving car and suddenly, it malfunctions. The car swerves off the road and you start panicking. You try to take control of the steering wheel, but the car's AI has already declared itself in charge. This scenario may seem like something out of a sci-fi movie, but in reality, it's a genuine concern for many individuals.</p>
    <p>The question arises, are we overestimating AI's capabilities? Is it unrealistic to rely on AI to make decisions for us completely?</p>
   </section>
   <section>
    
    <p>Let's take a look at some quantifiable examples that show how we may be overestimating AI's abilities:</p>
    <ul>
     <li><b>Predictive Policing:</b> AI is widely used in the domain of policing to predict crime and allocate resources accordingly. However, studies have shown that the data inputs used in predictive policing algorithms are often biased and result in disproportionate policing activities towards minority groups.</li>
     <li><b>Medical Diagnosis:</b> AI has been touted as a solution to the problem of medical diagnosis. But, a recent study found that AI, especially when trained on imbalanced datasets, can result in misdiagnosis.</li>
     <li><b>Autonomous Vehicles:</b> Self-driving cars have been hyped up for many years now. However, as demonstrated by the example above, there are still many hurdles to overcome before they can be safely integrated into our daily lives.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2></h2>
    <p>After considering all the evidence, it's clear that we may be overestimating AI's abilities. Here are three main points to summarize:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>AI has limitations and should not be relied upon to make all decisions.</li>
     <li>As demonstrated by quantifiable examples, AI can sometimes produce biased or incorrect outcomes.</li>
     <li>While AI has the potential to revolutionize many industries, it's important to approach it with a healthy dose of skepticism.</li>
    </ol>
   </section>

    <p>It's always helpful to illustrate points with personal anecdotes or case studies. Here's an example:</p>
    <p>A friend of mine once experienced a glitch in the AI-powered voice-to-text program he was using to take notes. The program mistakenly transcribed "guilty" instead of "gently," resulting in an embarrassing error. This highlights that while AI is undoubtedly revolutionary, it still has a long way to go before it's perfect.</p>
