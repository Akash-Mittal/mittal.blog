  <h1>Pakistan on the brink: UN warns country can face acute food insecurity amidst political instability</h1> <img src="images/Pakistan-on-the-brink-UN-warns-country-can-face-acute-food-insecurity-amidst-political-instability.jpeg" alt="+Pakistan-on-the-brink-UN-warns-country-can-face-acute-food-insecurity-amidst-political-instability+">
  <p></p>
  <p>As I traveled across Pakistan, I was struck by the beauty of the country and its people. But amidst this beauty, I couldn't help but notice the signs of political instability which have plagued the nation for years.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Beyond the headlines, however, there is another crisis lurking, one which threatens the very survival of millions of Pakistanis - the looming threat of acute food insecurity.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>According to a recent report by the United Nations, over 18 million people are in need of food assistance in Pakistan, with a staggering 70 percent of the population living below the poverty line.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One of the biggest drivers of this crisis is the political instability which is tearing the country apart. In recent years, there have been multiple terrorist attacks in Pakistan which have claimed the lives of innocent civilians as well as security personnel.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>These attacks have led to an increase in military presence in the country, with Pakistan's military now involved in multiple conflicts both within and outside of its borders.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Amidst this chaos, the agricultural sector of the country has been neglected and underdeveloped. While 45 percent of the population is employed in agriculture, the sector contributes less than 20 percent to the country's GDP.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This lack of investment in agriculture has led to the degradation of the soil, overuse of water resources and low crop yields.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>For millions of Pakistanis, this means that food is becoming increasingly scarce, with many unable to afford even basic staples such as rice and flour.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In fact, the UN report states that almost 50 percent of children in Pakistan are malnourished, suffering from stunted growth and cognitive impairment.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One of the most heart-wrenching examples of this crisis is in the province of Tharparkar, which has been hit by drought for years.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In 2018, reports emerged of babies dying due to malnutrition, with the local hospital receiving over 1000 cases of malnutrition-related illnesses in just three months.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>As the UN warns of a growing food crisis in Pakistan, it is clear that urgent action is needed to address the issues at the heart of the problem.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Here are three steps that I believe the government and the international community need to take to address the issue:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Invest in agriculture: The government needs to invest more in the agricultural sector to improve crop yields and create more job opportunities for farmers. This will help to reduce poverty and food insecurity, while also contributing to economic growth.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Increase access to education: Education is key to addressing issues such as malnutrition, as it allows people to access the knowledge they need to make informed decisions about their health. The government needs to provide more opportunities for education, particularly in rural areas where access is limited.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Encourage international aid: The international community needs to recognize the severity of the food crisis in Pakistan and provide more aid to help address the issue. This aid should be targeted towards improving access to food and nutrition for the most vulnerable groups, such as children and people living in poverty.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>As a final point, I would like to stress the importance of individual actions in addressing the food crisis in Pakistan.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Whether it's reducing our consumption of meat, supporting local farmers or volunteering with organizations working on the ground, there are many small steps we can take to make a big difference.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Together, we can help to build a brighter future for the people of Pakistan, where food insecurity is a thing of the past.</p>
