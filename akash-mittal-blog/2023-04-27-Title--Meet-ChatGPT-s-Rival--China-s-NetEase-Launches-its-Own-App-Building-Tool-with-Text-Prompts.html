  <p></p>
  <p>Have you ever wished for an app that could precisely tailor to your needs, without requiring you to undergo the hassle of coding? Well, the Chinese game developer NetEase has heard your prayers and has launched its own AI-powered app-building tool, which rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT, by using text prompts to develop applications.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In September 2021, NetEase entered the application-building arena with "AI Studio," a tool that harnesses the abilities of AI language models to produce custom mobile and web applications. NetEase has introduced this app-building tool to help businesses traverse the intricate and time-consuming process of developing software.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>NetEase's AI Studio offers a more intuitive approach to the customization of applications than other low-code or no-code software solutions. By simply inputting text prompts, the AI system can recognize the needs of a company or individual and then create and code the app accordingly.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Moreover, this app-building tool can create customized solutions for various industries, such as e-commerce, finance, and education.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>For example, if a textile manufacturer has a requirement, they can describe it in simple language, and then, AI Studio will create a tailored app. It will automatically generate interface designs and backend code, enabling developers to construct apps at a far more efficient pace.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, China's NetEase has launched AI Studio, an app-building tool that utilizes the power of AI language models to create custom mobile and web applications. This new tool will help in the acceleration of the app-building process, resulting in more efficient solutions for businesses and organizations. This app-building tool will certainly revolutionize the field of software development, in addition to providing endless possibilities for future innovation.</p>
