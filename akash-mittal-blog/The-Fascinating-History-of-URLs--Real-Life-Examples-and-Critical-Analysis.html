    <h2>The Birth of URLs</h2>
    <p>Did you know that the first URL was registered way back in 1985? It was a simple text-based address used to locate documents on the internet. But things didn't start to get interesting until the mid-1990s when companies like Amazon and Yahoo started using URLs to build their websites. These URLs included a series of directories and files that made it easier for users to navigate and find what they were looking for.</p>

    <h2>Real Life Examples</h2>
    <p>Today, URLs are an integral part of our daily lives. We use them to access our favorite websites, shop online, and connect with others on social media. But how have URLs evolved to meet our changing needs?</p>
    <p>Let's take a look at some real-life examples:</p>
    <ul>
     <li><a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a> - The simple and easy-to-remember URL makes it a go-to search engine for millions of internet users.</li>
     <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> - The e-commerce giant uses a complex URL structure to help users find exactly what they're looking for.</li>
     <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> - The social media platform simplifies its URLs to make them shareable and easy to remember.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Critical Comments</h2>
    <p>While URLs have come a long way since their inception, they still have some limitations. Here are three critical comments on URLs:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>URLs can be long and complex, making them difficult to remember and share.</li>
     <li>They can also be vulnerable to hacking and phishing attacks, compromising the security of users' personal information.</li>
     <li>With the rise of mobile devices, URLs have had to adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions, presenting new challenges for web developers and designers.</li>
