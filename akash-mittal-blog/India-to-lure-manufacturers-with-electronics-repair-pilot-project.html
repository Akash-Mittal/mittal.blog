  <h1 class="title">India to lure manufacturers with electronics repair pilot project</h1> <img src="images/India-to-lure-manufacturers-with-electronics-repair-pilot-project.jpeg" alt="+India-to-lure-manufacturers-with-electronics-repair-pilot-project+">
  <p class="story">In a bid to attract foreign electronics manufacturers to India and boost the country's repair industry, the Indian government has launched a new pilot project. Under the project, companies will be required to establish in-house repair facilities, with the aim of creating a market for repair and refurbishing services within the country.</p>
  <p>India is currently the world's second-largest smartphone market, but the majority of these devices are imported, with only a small percentage being manufactured domestically. The Indian government is now looking to change this by enticing electronics manufacturers to open new plants in the country, offering various incentives including tax breaks and subsidies. The new pilot project aims to further encourage companies to invest, by providing a ready market for repair and refurbishment services.</p>
  <h2>Quantifiable examples</h2>
  <p>According to government officials, becoming a hub for electronics repair could help create up to 10 million jobs in the country. Additionally, the establishment of in-house repair facilities could result in a 30% reduction in the amount of electronic waste generated in India. This reduction in waste could have a significant impact on the environment, as India currently generates over 2 million tonnes of electronic waste per year.</p>
