  <h1>The Rise of Generative AI: Regulators Dust off Ruel Books to Tackle ChatGPT</h1> <img src="images/The-Rise-of-Generative-AI-Regulators-Dust-off-Ruel-Books-to-Tackle-ChatGPT.jpeg" alt="+The-Rise-of-Generative-AI-Regulators-Dust-off-Ruel-Books-to-Tackle-ChatGPT+">
  <p>Imagine chatting with someone whom you think is your friend, but in reality, it's a machine learning algorithm generating responses in real time. This is the world of generative AI, where artificial intelligence creates its language, images, music, and even entire stories.</p>
  <p>Generative AI is an AI subfield that focuses on creating autonomous, creative algorithms capable of generating new and unique content. It's a phenomenon that's gained massive popularity, primarily due to its practical application in chatbots, virtual assistants, and language translation. One such generative AI model that has taken the world by storm is ChatGPT.</p>
  <h2>What is ChatGPT?</h2>
  <p>ChatGPT stands for "Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3," an AI language model that generated a lot of buzz earlier this year. It accesses a massive corpus of text data, including books, articles, and general web content, to create its responses. While answering any query, this model can show both logical reasoning and diverse details and can frame a clear response without missing the context, making it one of the most advanced chatbots available today.</p>
  <p>The recent advances in generative AI, including ChatGPT, have raised concerns on how they handle sensitive data, bias, and cybersecurity threats. Therefore, around the world, policymakers and regulators have begun to look more attentively at these technologies.</p>
  <h2>Regulatory Attention</h2>
  <p>Global regulators now recognize the need to safeguard users against the various risk factors associated with these new technologies. They are actively pursuing regulatory frameworks that introduce stringent laws to govern these AI models' development, deployment and use. For instance:</p>
  <h3>The EU</h3>
  <p>The European Union introduced a set of regulations on 21st April 2021 called The European Data Governance Act (EDGA), focusing on data protection and governance. EDGA provides for a thoughtful approach to artificial intelligence applications while giving the EU a definitive competitive edge in its AI ventures.</p>
  <h3>The US</h3>
  <p>The United States Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Defense have shown concerns over the risks posed by generative AI. There is an excellent possibility that the new administration will establish regulations to address generative AI in terms of national security and defense.</p>
  <h3>China</h3>
  <p>The Chinese government is also developing regulations to govern AI, with an emphasis on data privacy and security. In December 2020, the National People's Congress of China released its Personal Information Protection Law to govern data handling practices of AI algorithms.</p>
  <h2>The Threat of Biased Generative AI</h2>
  <p>Cybersecurity concerns notwithstanding, the most pressing issue for regulators is the risk of bias prevailing in generative AI models like ChatGPT. Bias in generative AI refers to the tendency of AI algorithms to repeat or strengthen pre-existing human biases that occur within the data sets they rely upon. For instance, if a generative AI algorithm draws upon text data from predominantly white authors, it may develop biases that discriminate against non-white writers.</p>
  <p>Moreover, such generative AI tends to magnify biases that occur in the training datasets it depends upon. As such, bias within generative AI algorithms can result in discriminatory hiring and employment practices, inadequate medical care, unfair pricing practices, among other issues.</p>
  <p>Recently, OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, released a report on the biases prevalent in the algorithms. The report showed that the model still has a significant cognitive bias problem against certain types of questions. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the data used to train these generative AI models to ensure errors get corrected upfront and prevent giving rise to discriminatory content, eventually aiding discriminatory practices.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Generative AI is revolutionizing the way machines work today, posing unprecedented benefits and challenges to humankind. The vast potential applications of these technologies come with substantial privacy and ethical concerns for regulators across the globe. Therefore, it becomes our responsibility to mitigate the risks while expanding the boundaries of these new frontier technologies.</p>
  <p>Here are three key points to consider:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Setting common standards: Governments need to standardize regulations that balance innovation and consumer protection, including data privacy policies, security measures, compensation, and liability clauses.</li>
   <li>Transparency and accountability: Companies that deploy generative AI, like ChatGPT, must take responsibility for their use and transparency of their algorithms. They should offer transparency reports, document how they train their algorithms, and choose to communicate with their users effectively.</li>
   <li>Educating the public: Finally, it is essential to educate the public on the abilities and limitations of these AI models to prevent misunderstanding and promote the adoption of AI that benefits society.</li>
