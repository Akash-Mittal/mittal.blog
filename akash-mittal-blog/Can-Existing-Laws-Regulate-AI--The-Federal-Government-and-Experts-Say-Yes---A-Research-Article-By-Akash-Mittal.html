    <p>Artificial Intelligence has come a long way since its inception. From chatbots to self-driving cars, AI has transformed the way we live and work. However, as the technology continues to evolve, concerns have been raised about its regulation. Can existing laws regulate AI? The answer is yes, according to the federal government and experts.</p>
    <h3>Real Life Examples</h3>
    <p>Several real-life examples demonstrate that existing laws can regulate AI. For instance, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) passed by the European Union in 2018 sets strict rules on data privacy and security. It applies to all companies working with data, whether they use AI or not. Another example is the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which gives Californians the right to know what personal data companies are collecting and who theyâre sharing it with. CCPA applies to AI-powered companies as well.</p>
