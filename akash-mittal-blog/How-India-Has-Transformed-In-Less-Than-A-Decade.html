  <h1>How India Has Transformed In Less Than A Decade</h1> <img src="images/How-India-Has-Transformed-In-Less-Than-A-Decade.jpeg" alt="+How-India-Has-Transformed-In-Less-Than-A-Decade+">
  <p>India, a country that has always been known for its vibrant culture, rich heritage, and chaotic streets, has undergone a dramatic transformation in a span of less than a decade. The changes that India has witnessed have been phenomenal, and there are many quantifiable examples that prove the same.</p>
  <h2>The Story of Transformation</h2>
  <p>Let me take you back to the year 2011, when India was a different place altogether. The country was grappling with corruption, poverty, illiteracy, and a plethora of other problems. India was not considered a preferred destination for investors, and many people were skeptical about doing business in the country. But things started to change with the new government that took over in 2014.</p>
  <p>The new government brought in sweeping reforms and policies that aimed at transforming India into a global superpower. The focus was on economic growth, job creation, and infrastructure development. The government also launched several flagship programs such as Make in India, Digital India, Skill India, and Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, to name a few.</p>
  <p>Fast forward to 2021, and the India we see today is vastly different from what it was a decade ago. India has emerged as the fastest-growing major economy in the world, surpassing even China. The country has attracted billions of dollars in foreign investments, and many multinational companies have set up shop in India. The government has also launched several initiatives to promote entrepreneurship, innovation, and start-ups.</p>
  
  <p>There are many quantifiable examples that showcase India's transformation in the last decade:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>India's GDP has grown at an average rate of 6.9% from 2014-2019.</li>
   <li>The stock market has surged by over 500% since 2014.</li>
   <li>India is now the world's second-largest smartphone market, with over 760 million users.</li>
