  <h1>Texas A&amp;M Commerce Professor Claims Entire Class Used AI to Cheat</h1> <img src="images/Texas=A=M=Commerce=Professor=Claims=Entire=Class=Used=AI=to=Cheat.jpeg" alt="+Texas=A=M=Commerce=Professor=Claims=Entire=Class=Used=AI=to=Cheat+">
  <p>It was just another day in the life of Professor Arif Sarwat at Texas A&amp;M Commerce, until he stumbled upon technological malfeasance so pervasive it rocked his world. What Sarwat discovered was an entire class of students using artificial intelligence to cheat.</p>
  <p>Sarwat, an assistant professor in the Department of Marketing and Business Analytics, shared his experience on social media, causing a stir in the academic community. His controversial post alleged that the students in question were using AI=powered online platforms that provided them with answers to exam questions in real time.</p>
  <p>Such incidents are not uncommon, but what made this one stand out is the extent of the cheating. According to Sarwat, not only did almost every student in the class use the software, but they also copied the answers verbatim. This meant that all their responses were identical, down to the punctuation and wording, leaving no margin for error.</p>
  <h2>Quantifiable Examples of Cheating with AI</h2>
  <p>The case of Texas A&amp;M Commerce may be an extreme example, but cheating with AI is a growing trend in schools and universities worldwide. In fact, a 2021 report by edtech company Turnitin found that cheating with AI increased by 15% between 2019 and 2020.</p>
  <p>Another study by online learning platform Udemy found that over a third of students surveyed admitted to using AI=powered tools to cheat on exams and assignments. These tools range from chatbots that simulate human conversations to machine learning algorithms that analyze patterns in past exam questions to generate accurate answers.</p>
  <p>One of the reasons for the rise in AI cheating is its accessibility and affordability. These tools are often available for free or at a low cost, making them easily accessible to students of all backgrounds. Moreover, their ease of use and seamlessness within the digital learning environment make them an attractive option for students struggling to keep up with the demands of online classes.</p>
  <h2>Why Cheating with AI is a Problem</h2>
  <p>Academic cheating has always been an issue, but cheating with AI presents new challenges to schools and universities. For one, it is harder to detect and prevent, as these tools can be used discreetly and remotely.</p>
  <p>Moreover, cheating with AI undermines the integrity of the academic system by devaluing the efforts of honest students and eroding trust in the value of a degree. It also perpetuates a culture of instant gratification and shortcuts, instead of promoting a culture of hard work, critical thinking, and intellectual curiosity.</p>
  <h2>What Can be Done to Prevent Cheating with AI?</h2>
  <p>Preventing cheating with AI requires a multi=faceted approach that involves educators, administrators, and students themselves. Here are three practical steps that can be taken:</p>
  <ol>
   <li><strong>Educate students on the consequences of cheating.</strong></li>
   <p>Many students may be unaware of the ethical and legal implications of cheating with AI, or they may not consider it a serious offense. Educators should take the time to explain the consequences of such actions, both in terms of academic penalties and legal repercussions.</p>
   <li><strong>Use plagiarism checker software.</strong></li>
   <p>Plagiarism checker software like Turnitin can help detect instances of AI cheating by cross=referencing student submissions with databases of previous work and external sources. This can serve as a deterrent to students who may be tempted to cheat, as well as help educators identify patterns and trends in cheating behaviors.</p>
   <li><strong>Offer alternative assessments.</strong></li>
   <p>Providing students with alternative assessments like open=book exams, essay assignments, and group projects can lessen the temptation to cheat with AI. These assessments require critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration, which are more difficult to replicate with AI tools.</p>
