  <h1>India to Host the Virtual SCO Summit amid Ties Strife with Pakistan and China</h1> <img src="images/India-to-Host-the-Virtual-SCO-Summit-amid-Ties-Strife-with-Pakistan-and-China.jpeg" alt="+India-to-Host-the-Virtual-SCO-Summit-amid-Ties-Strife-with-Pakistan-and-China+">
  <p>It is fascinating how conflicts between nations can put a lot of things on hold. Amid the current ties strife with Pakistan and China, India is set to host the virtual Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit on July 4. The year 2021 marks the 20th anniversary of the inception of the SCO, and it is impressive how India is taking up the challenge of being the host nation.</p>
  <p>SCO is a Eurasian political, economic, and security alliance created to foster cooperation among its eight member countries- India, Pakistan, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. India joined the organization in 2017, and since then, it has played a significant role in strengthening regional security and promoting economic cooperation among its members.</p>
  
  <p>The SCO is becoming an essential organization for India, especially in the context of economic cooperation. In 2020, despite the Covid-19 pandemic, the SCO countries managed to increase their trade turnover by 8.9%, reaching over $170 billion. This number is expected to grow exponentially, and India's membership in the organization can bring in more significant benefits for its economy.</p>
  <p>Moreover, the SCO also serves as a significant platform to combat terrorism and extremism. According to reports, in May 2021, India and Russia agreed to work together to combat terrorism and drug trade during the SCO's defence ministers' meet in Dushanbe. This initiative is set to curb the rise of radicalization in the region, ensuring the SCO member nations' safety.</p>
  <h2>The Eye-catching  India's Bold Move to Host the SCO Summit Virtually Despite Ties Strife with Pakistan and China</h2>
  <p>The news of the virtual SCO summit is making headlines globally, and India's bold move of not backing down despite the current ties strife with Pakistan and China is impressive. The title is magnetic as it captures the reader's attention and creates curiosity to delve further into the article.</p>
  <h2></h2>
  <p>1. Hosting the virtual SCO summit shows India's determination to strengthen ties with other nations despite their differences. This initiative can lead to regional cooperation and promote economic growth for member countries. 2. The SCO also serves as a significant platform to combat terrorism and drug trade in the region. India, along with other member nations, is taking steps to ensure peace and security in the region. 3. India's membership in the SCO is becoming increasingly critical, and its role in the organization is essential in the Asian geopolitical context.</p>
  <h2> or Case Studies</h2>
  <p>India's participation in the SCO has already brought concrete results, especially in the fight against terrorism. In 2019, during the SCO summit in Kyrgyzstan's capital, Bishkek, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke about the need to fight against radicalization, extremism, and terrorism. This initiative struck a chord with other members, and India's proposal was adopted as part of the summit's joint declaration. Moreover, India's participation in SCO has also led to facilitating connectivity and cooperation in the region. For instance, India's International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) project is gaining momentum with Russia, Kazakhstan, and Iran included as participating countries. The INSTC, once operational, will provide a vital trade route for Indian businesses to access markets in Central Asia and beyond.</p>
