     <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
     <p>The Web 3 Technology Market is definitely one to keep an eye on as major companies such as Antier Solutions and Fylladey continue to innovate and develop new solutions that have the potential to revolutionize entire industries. However, it's important to note that as with any new technology, there are potential downsides and pitfalls that need to be addressed before Web 3 can truly fulfill its promise of being a decentralized and secure alternative to the current internet infrastructure.</p>
     <ol>
      <li>While it's exciting to see major companies like Antier Solutions and Fylladey leading the way in Web 3 development, it's important to remember that this technology is still in its early stages and there are a lot of unknowns.</li>
      <li>One potential downside to Web 3 is the potential for increased regulatory scrutiny as governments and regulatory bodies seek to understand and control this new technology.</li>
      <li>Another potential pitfall is the risk of centralization, as some companies may seek to consolidate their power and influence within the Web 3 ecosystem, potentially undermining the very principles that make Web 3 so promising in the first place.</li>
