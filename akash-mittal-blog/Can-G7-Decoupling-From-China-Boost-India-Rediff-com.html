   <h2>An Inside Look at the Future of Indian Economy</h2>
  </header>

   <article>
    <p>India is one of the largest economies in the world and it has great potential to grow. However, in the recent years, the Indian economy has been facing several issues such as high inflation, high fiscal deficit, and low GDP growth. One of the biggest factors that could help India to boost its economy is the G7 countries decoupling from China.</p>
    <h3>Decoupling from China: What does it mean?</h3>
    <p>Decoupling from China refers to the process of disentangling from Chinese supply chains and markets. G7 countries have started to rethink their dependence on China and are looking for alternatives. This presents a great opportunity for India to emerge as an alternative destination for these countries.</p>
    <h3>The Impact of Decoupling on Indian Economy</h3>
    <p>The G7 countries account for around 50% of the world's GDP and decoupling from China could lead to a massive shift of global supply chains. India has the potential to benefit from this shift and become a manufacturing hub for these countries. This would not only boost India's manufacturing sector but also create more employment opportunities for millions of people.</p>
    <h3>Quantifiable Examples</h3>
    <p>India's current share in global exports is only 1.7%, whereas China's share is around 13%. If India can capture even a small portion of China's market share, it could be a game-changer for the Indian economy.</p>
    <p>According to a report by Nomura, even a 5% shift in global supply chains from China to India could add $27 billion to India's GDP and create around 1 million jobs.</p>
    <h3></h3>
    <p>As someone who has witnessed the transformation of the Indian economy over the last few decades, I can confidently say that this is an exciting time for India. In the early 1990s, India had to face an economic crisis due to the balance of payment issues. The government had to take drastic steps to revive the economy. However, the growth remained sluggish for a long time.</p>
    <p>But now, with the world looking for alternative destinations to China, India has a chance to emerge as a global manufacturing powerhouse. With a young and talented workforce, a huge consumer market, and a government focused on economic reforms, India is well-positioned to take advantage of this opportunity and become a major player in the global economy.</p>
