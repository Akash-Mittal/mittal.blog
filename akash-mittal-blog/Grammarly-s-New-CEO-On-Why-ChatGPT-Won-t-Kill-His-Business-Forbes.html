    <p>There's a story that has been circulating about Grammarly's new CEO, Brad Hoover, and his first meeting with the company's co-founder, Alex Shevchenko. Hoover, who was previously the CEO of the financial tech company, Deserve, had just taken the helm at Grammarly, and he was eager to share his vision for the future of the company.</p>
    <p>As Hoover was walking Shevchenko through his plans, he could see that the co-founder was becoming increasingly concerned. Finally, Shevchenko interrupted him and said, "Brad, I think you're missing the point. Grammarly is not a chatbot company."</p>
    <p>Despite the initial miscommunication, Hoover and Shevchenko quickly got on the same page. And in a recent interview with Forbes, Hoover explained why he's confident that Grammarly will thrive in a world where chatbots and other AI-powered writing tools are on the rise.</p>

    <p>Hoover points to several metrics that show that Grammarly is not only competing with these new tools, but also thriving alongside them. For example, the company's revenue has doubled every year since its launch in 2009, and it currently has over 20 million daily active users.</p>
    <p>Grammarly has also expanded beyond its original focus on grammar and spelling, and now offers tools for improving tone, clarity, and even formatting. The company has also developed a sophisticated machine learning algorithm that can recognize and adapt to the unique writing style of each user.</p>
    <p>Perhaps most importantly, Hoover says that Grammarly is not just a tool, but a community. The company's users are passionate advocates, and Hoover believes that this loyalty is what will set Grammarly apart from its competitors.</p>

    <h2>Why ChatGPT Won't Kill Grammarly</h2>
    <p>Hoover acknowledges that tools like ChatGPT, which can generate coherent and convincing writing with little human intervention, are impressive. But he believes that they will never fully replace human writers, or even tools like Grammarly that rely on human input and feedback.</p>
    <p>"Writing is an inherently human activity," Hoover says. "It's about communication and connection. And while AI can certainly help us become better writers, it can't replace the creativity and nuance that only humans can bring to the table."</p>
    <p>Hoover also notes that writing is not just about conveying information, but about conveying personality. "When you read something written by someone else, you get a sense of who they are, their values, their perspective," he says. "Chatbots and other tools may be able to create convincing writing, but they can't create a voice or a personality."</p>
    <p>Finally, Hoover believes that the rise of AI-powered writing tools is actually a boon for companies like Grammarly. "These tools are creating more awareness and interest in writing and grammar than ever before," he says. "And as more people become interested in improving their writing skills, we're in a great position to help them."</p>
