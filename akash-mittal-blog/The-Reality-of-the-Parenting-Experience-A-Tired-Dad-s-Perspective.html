    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>"Dad, can we play?" As a father of two energetic kids, I get this question at least 10 times a day. As much as I'd like to say yes all the time, there are moments when I just can't bring myself to get up and play with them. The parenting experience is tough, and anyone who tells you otherwise is either lying or hasn't experienced it yet. In this article, I'll share some of my thoughts on what it's really like to be a parent.</p>

    <h2>The Reality of Parenting</h2>
    <p>From changing diapers to dealing with temper tantrums, the parenting experience can be overwhelming at times. There's never enough time in the day to get everything done, and you often find yourself struggling to keep up. Here are a few examples of what it's really like to be a parent:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>On average, parents lose 6 months' worth of sleep in the first 2 years of their child's life.</li>
     <li>83% of parents report feeling stressed out on a regular basis.</li>
     <li>49% of parents say that they don't have enough time for themselves.</li>
     <li>It's estimated that the average parent will change over 7,000 diapers before their child is potty trained.</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>

     <li>Ask for help: Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. Whether it's from your spouse, family members, or friends, having a support system can make all the difference.</li>
     <li>Focus on the positive: While there will always be challenges, it's important to focus on the positive aspects of parenting. Whether it's the first time your child says "I love you" or when they accomplish a new milestone, celebrating the small victories can help you stay motivated.</li>
