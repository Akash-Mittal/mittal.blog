    <p>Kim Kardashian has recently opened up about her struggles as a mother of four kids. In an interview with an online magazine, she admitted to crying herself to sleep many nights due to the stress of parenting.</p>
    <p>She talked about how challenging it is to balance her career, social life, marriage, and motherhood. "It's not easy juggling everything," she said. "I feel like I'm pulled in so many directions, and sometimes I feel like I'm failing at everything."</p>
    <p>She also talked about her anxiety and the pressure she feels to be a perfect mom. "I see all these moms on social media who seem to have it all together, and I wonder what's wrong with me," she said. "Why can't I be like them?"</p>
    <p>Kim's honesty about her struggles has resonated with many other parents who also feel overwhelmed and underappreciated. But it's also sparked a conversation about the unrealistic expectations we put on ourselves and each other as parents.</p>
