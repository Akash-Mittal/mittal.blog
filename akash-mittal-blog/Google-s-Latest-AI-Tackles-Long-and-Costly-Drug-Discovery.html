    <p>Have you ever waited for hours at a doctor's office, only to be prescribed medicine that might not work for you or might have harmful side effects? Or have you ever wondered why it takes so long for new drugs to enter the market? These are just some of the problems that Google's latest AI is aiming to solve.</p>
    <p>The new AI system is designed to revolutionize the drug discovery process, which is currently a long and costly endeavor. It involves testing millions of compounds to find potential treatments for various diseases, and can take up to 15 years and billions of dollars to bring a drug to market.</p>
    <p>Google's AI, built in partnership with biotech firm AstraZeneca, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze massive amounts of data and predict which compounds are most likely to be effective in treating a specific disease. By narrowing down the list of potential compounds to the most promising ones, the AI system can speed up the drug discovery process significantly.</p>

   <div class="examples">
    <h2>Quantifiable Examples:</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>The new AI system can analyze up to 15 million compounds per day, which is 10 times faster than traditional drug discovery methods.</li>
     <li>Google's AI has already been able to identify potential treatments for two rare diseases: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and triple-negative breast cancer.</li>
     <li>According to AstraZeneca's Head of AI, Nick Lynch, the AI system has increased the success rate of identifying effective drug compounds from 0.1% to 10%.</li>
    </ul>
   </div>
   <div class="tips">
    <h2>Practical Tips:</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>As a patient, you can stay informed about new drug discoveries by following reliable sources of information, such as the FDA or reputable medical journals.</li>
     <li>If you are interested in a career in drug discovery or AI, consider pursuing a degree or certification in the field and staying up to date with the latest research.</li>
     <li>Support organizations that are dedicated to improving the drug discovery process, such as the National Institutes of Health or the World Health Organization.</li>
    </ul>
