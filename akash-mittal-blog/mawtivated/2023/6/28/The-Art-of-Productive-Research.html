   <main>
    <p>James Rollins, author of the bestselling Sigma Force series, had a problem. He was a self-confessed procrastinator, especially when it came to research. He had a tendency to get lost down rabbit holes, researching obscure facts and figures that had little bearing on his novels. Before he knew it, hours had passed, and he hadn't written a single word.</p>
    <p>It was only when he became aware of his procrastination habit that Rollins was able to take action. He realized that research wasn't the problem; it was how he was approaching it. He needed to be more productive, more focused, and more efficient.</p>
    <h2>An Example</h2>
    <p>Rollins decided to implement a system. He would allocate a set amount of time for research, say two hours, and would aim to find the information he needed within that time frame. If he hadn't found what he was looking for after two hours, he would move on and make a note to come back to it later, rather than continuing to dig deeper.</p>
    <p>It wasn't an easy habit to break, but Rollins persisted. By taking a more structured approach to research, he was able to make more progress on his novels and get his books to market more quickly. He also felt less overwhelmed and more in control of his workload.</p>
    <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
    <p>If you're struggling with procrastination when it comes to research, here are some practical tips to help you break the cycle:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Set a timer for your research sessions. This will help you stay focused and avoid getting sidetracked.</li>
     <li>Make a list of the information you need to find. Having a clear plan will help you stay on track.</li>
     <li>Avoid following links down rabbit holes. Stick to the information you need and move on.</li>
     <li>Take breaks. It's important to give your brain a rest and come back to the task with fresh eyes.</li>
     <li>Keep a notebook handy. Jot down any ideas or thoughts that come to mind during the research process.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, research doesn't have to be a source of procrastination. By adopting a more structured approach, setting limits, and staying focused, you can make the most of your research time and get the job done. Remember, research is an essential part of the writing process, but it doesn't have to become a black hole. Use these tips to stay on track and make research work for you.</p>

     "I think the worst and most insidious procrastination for me is research. I will be looking for some bit of fact or figure to include in the novel, and before I know, I've wasted an entire morning delving into that subject matter without a word written." - James Rollins
