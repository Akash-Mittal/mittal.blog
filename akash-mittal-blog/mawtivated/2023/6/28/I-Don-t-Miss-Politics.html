   <p>It was a hot summer day in Texas when Jeb Bush decided to quit politics. He was tired of the constant fighting, the endless debates, the never-ending race for power. He had served as Governor of Florida, ran for President of the United States, but now it was time to move on. As he put it, "I don't miss politics."</p>
   <p>But why? Why would someone who had been in politics for decades suddenly decide to leave it all behind? The answer is simple - politics can be a cruel and unforgiving game. It's no wonder that so many people who enter politics are disillusioned and burned out by the end of their careers.</p>
   <h2>The Dark Side of Politics</h2>
   <p>Politics can be a dirty business. You have to be willing to get your hands dirty to get anything done. You have to compromise your beliefs, make deals with people you don't like, and constantly fight off attacks from your opponents. It's a high-stress job that can take a toll on your mental health and well-being.</p>
   <p>But that's not the worst part. The worst part is that politics can turn people against each other. It can divide families, destroy friendships, and tear communities apart. We see it all the time in the news - politicians arguing with each other, people protesting in the streets, and social media ablaze with angry comments.</p>
   <p>And for what? What do we really gain from all this fighting? Not much, it seems. The world keeps turning, the problems keep piling up, and we end up right where we started.</p>
   <h2>A Life Outside of Politics</h2>
   <p>So if politics is so bad, what's the alternative? Well, for Jeb Bush, it was spending time with his family, working on his business ventures, and enjoying the simple things in life. He didn't need the constant stress and pressure of politics to be happy.</p>
   <p>And neither do we. We can have fulfilling lives outside of politics, whether that means pursuing a hobby, spending time with loved ones, or giving back to our communities in other ways. There are so many ways to make a positive impact in the world that don't involve politics.</p>
   <p>Of course, that doesn't mean we should completely ignore politics. It's important to stay informed about what's going on in the world and to vote for candidates who we believe will make a difference. But we don't have to let politics consume our lives.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>To sum it up, here are three points to keep in mind:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Politics can be a cruel and unforgiving game that can take a toll on our mental health and well-being</li>
    <li>Politics can divide people and tear communities apart, which can cause more harm than good</li>
    <li>We can have fulfilling lives outside of politics and still make a positive impact in the world in other ways</li>
   </ul>
