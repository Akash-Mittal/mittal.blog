   <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
   <p>When I was a teenager, I was known for my wit. I would often make clever jokes or puns that would leave my friends in stitches. But as I got older, I began to lose that sense of humor. Life became more serious, and I became more reserved. It wasn't until I stumbled upon a stand-up comedy class that I realized how much I was missing. The class not only reignited my love for comedy but also taught me the power of humor and how it can be used to connect people, alleviate stress, and heal wounds.</p>
   <h2>The Wisdom of Garrison Keillor</h2>
   <blockquote>
    "God writes a lot of comedy... the trouble is, he's stuck with so many bad actors who don't know how to play funny."
   </blockquote>
