   <section id="introduction">
    <p>Joseph Barbera, one of the co-founders of Hanna-Barbera, the animation studio that created classics like Tom &amp; Jerry and The Flintstones, once said, "I don't know that I spent any more time alone than any other kid, but being by myself never bothered me." This statement highlights the importance of solitude in our lives. While we live in a culture that values connectivity and constant interaction, there is a power in taking time for yourself.</p>
