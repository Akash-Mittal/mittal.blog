    <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
    <p>When my son was struggling in school, I realized that I needed to take a more active role in his education. I started volunteering in his classroom and working with him on homework every night. Over time, I saw a marked improvement in his grades and his overall attitude toward school.</p>
    <p>I believe that my involvement played a big role in his success, and it inspired me to advocate for parental involvement in education on a larger scale.</p>

    <h2>The Importance of Parental Involvement</h2>
    <p>Research shows that parental involvement in education is linked to better academic performance, higher graduation rates, and more positive attitudes toward school. Yet, too often, parents feel shut out of the education process and are unsure of how to be involved.</p>
    <p>Former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum has been a vocal advocate for parental involvement in education. He has stated that, "The government has convinced parents that at some point it's no longer their responsibility. And in fact, they force them, in many respects, to turn their children over to the public education system and wrest control from them and block them out of participation of that."</p>
    <p>It's time for a change. Parents need to be empowered and encouraged to play an active role in their children's education. When parents are involved, students are more likely to succeed.</p>
