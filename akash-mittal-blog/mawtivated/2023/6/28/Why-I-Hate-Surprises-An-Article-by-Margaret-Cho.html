  <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
  <p>When I was a kid, I loved surprises. I remember when my parents surprised me with a trip to Disneyland for my seventh birthday â€“ it was the best day ever. But as I've gotten older, I've come to hate surprises. They are emotionally exhausting and I would never ever want to have one. In the same way, I would never want to have a surprise birthday party. That would be horrible.</p>
  <h2>My Story</h2>
  <p>As a comedian and actress, I am often in the public eye and have to deal with unexpected situations. However, I have found that I perform better and am less stressed when I have a plan in place. This is also true in my personal life. I have found that when I am prepared for what is going to happen, I am able to enjoy the moment more fully.</p>
  <p>For example, when I go on vacation, I plan out all of the activities ahead of time. I know where I am going to eat, what I am going to do and when I am going to do it. Some people might think this takes away from the spontaneity of the trip, but for me, it makes the trip more enjoyable. I don't have to worry about making last minute decisions or missing out on something I really wanted to do.</p>
  <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>Communicate with your friends and family. Let them know that you don't like surprises and that you prefer to have a plan in place.</li>
   <li>Plan ahead. If you know something unexpected is going to happen, prepare as much as possible.</li>
   <li>Be honest with yourself. If you know that surprises cause you anxiety, it's better to avoid them.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>Surprises can be emotionally exhausting.</li>
   <li>Having a plan in place can make situations more enjoyable.</li>
   <li>Communication is key.</li>
  </ol>
