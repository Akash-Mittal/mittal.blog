    <h2>The Power of Poetry</h2>
    <p>It was a bright and sunny day when John walked into my office. I could see the excitement in his eyes as he told me his story. John had been blind since birth, but he always had a way with words. He loved poetry, and would often recite it from memory. However, he never fully grasped the true beauty of poetry until one day, when he heard a speech by the renowned poet Maya Angelou.</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>"Poetry is what makes me laugh or cry or yawn, what makes my toenails twinkle, what makes me want to do this or that or nothing."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>John was so moved by her words, that he decided to take up poetry himself. He started writing his own verses, and soon found that he was able to see beyond his blindness. Poetry had opened up a world of possibilities that he had never imagined before.</p>
    <p>It was then that I realized the true power of poetry. It is not just a collection of rhyming words or musings of an idle mind, but a tool to express oneself and to make sense of the world around us. It can help us connect with others and convey our deepest emotions. It is what Milton saw when he went blind.</p>

    <h2>The Story of Don Marquis</h2>
    <p>Don Marquis was an American journalist and author, best known for his creation of the character Archy, a cockroach who wrote free verse poetry. Despite his success as a writer, Marquis struggled with alcoholism and depression.</p>
    <p>However, even in his darkest moments, Marquis found solace and meaning in poetry. He once wrote:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>"I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Marquis used poetry as a way to express his innermost thoughts and to find beauty in the midst of despair. His story is a testament to the power of poetry to uplift and inspire, even in the most difficult of times.</p>
