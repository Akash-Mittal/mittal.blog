    <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time, there was a young fashion designer named Emma. She had a unique style that combined vintage and modern fashion. Emma always had a dream of starting her own clothing line, but she lacked the means to make it happen.</p>
    <p>One day, Emma discovered the power of the internet and how it could help her bring her dream to life. She started her own website, created her social media accounts, and shared her designs online. Slowly but surely, her followers began increasing, and her label became a success.</p>
    <p>Emma's story is just one example of how the digital era has changed the fashion industry and the way we express our individual style.</p>

    <h2>Author Background</h2>
    <blockquote>
     <p>"Style used to be an interaction between the human soul and tools that were limiting. In the digital era, it will have to come from the soul alone." - Jaron Lanier</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Jaron Lanier is an American computer philosophy writer and computer scientist who has been recognized as the founder of virtual reality. He is also a musician, artist, and author of many books, including "You are not a Gadget," "Who Owns The Future," and the most recent "Ten Arguments For Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now."</p>
    <p>Lanier believes that in the digital era, we are losing a part of our humanity by relying too much on technology. He argues that style was once an interaction between our souls and the tools we had available, but now it's up to us to create it from within ourselves without relying on external tools.</p>
