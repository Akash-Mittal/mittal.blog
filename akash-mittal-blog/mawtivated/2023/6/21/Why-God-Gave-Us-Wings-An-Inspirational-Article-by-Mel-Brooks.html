   <h2>An Inspirational Article by Mel Brooks</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>There was once a young man named Peter who lived in a small village nestled in the mountains. Peter had always been fascinated by birds and their ability to fly. He would often spend hours watching them soar through the sky, envy and wonder in his heart. One day, he decided that he too would learn to fly.</p>
   <p>Peter began by jumping off a small cliff, hoping to catch the wind and take off. But he only fell to the ground, bruised and battered. Undeterred, he tried again and again, each time with a different method or strategy. He built wings out of feathers and wax and tried to fly like Icarus, but the heat melted them and he fell once again. Despite the many failures, Peter persisted, driven by his desire to fly.</p>
   <p>Years went by, and Peter grew older but no closer to his dream. He became known as the village fool, laughed at and scorned by his fellow villagers for his foolish pursuit. One day, an old man, who had been watching Peter's attempts for years, approached him and asked him why he kept trying to fly when it was clear he never could.</p>
   <p>Peter replied, "Because I believe that God gave us wings, and it's up to us to learn how to use them."</p>
   <p>The old man smiled and said, "You're right, my boy. God did give us wings, but they're not made of feathers or wax. They're inside us, waiting to be discovered."</p>
   <p>And with those words, Peter finally understood. He had been so focused on the exterior that he had forgotten the interior. He had been looking for a way to fly, when all along he had the power within him to soar. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, feeling the wings within him unfurl and stretch as he opened his eyes to the sky. He spread his arms wide and leaped, soaring higher and higher until he disappeared into the clouds, free at last.</p>
   <h3>Author - Mel Brooks Story</h3>
   <p>I, Mel Brooks, have always been fascinated by the power of flight. As a child, I would spend hours watching planes take off and land, dreaming of the day I too could fly. It wasn't until much later in life that I realized that the power of flight was not limited to machines, but was in fact a spiritual and mental state of being.</p>
   <p>As a writer and filmmaker, I have always tried to inspire and motivate people to pursue their dreams, no matter how impossible they may seem. This article is no different. It is my hope that by telling Peter's story, I can inspire you to look within yourself and find the wings that God has given you.</p>
   <h3>Examples of God's Wings</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Strength: God gives us strength to overcome obstacles and challenges in life.</li>
    <li>Faith: God gives us faith to believe in ourselves and in a higher power.</li>
    <li>Imagination: God gives us imagination to think beyond the physical world and see what could be.</li>
    <li>Love: God gives us love to connect with others and with the divine.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Conclusion</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>Believe in yourself and in God's plan for you.</li>
    <li>Look within yourself for the wings that will enable you to fly.</li>
    <li>Remember that true power comes not from external forces, but from internal ones.</li>
