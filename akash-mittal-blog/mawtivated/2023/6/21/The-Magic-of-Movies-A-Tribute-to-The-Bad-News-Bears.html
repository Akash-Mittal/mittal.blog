  <p>It was the summer of '76, and Jack Black, a scrawny 8-year-old boy, had just moved to a new town. His father had just landed a new job and the family had to relocate. Jack didn't know anyone in the town and was nervous about making new friends. That's when he saw a poster for "The Bad News Bears" at the local theatre and begged his parents to take him to see it. They relented, and as he watched Walter Matthau coach a team of underdogs to victory, Jack felt something change within him. He felt inspired. He felt like he could make new friends and prove to the world that he was a winner.</p><!--  -->
