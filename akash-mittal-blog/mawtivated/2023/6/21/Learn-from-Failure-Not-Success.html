  <p>Jim Dale, a successful businessman, was once asked, 'What is the secret of your success?' Jim responded, 'I have failed a lot of times.' This statement strikes the core of the topic- you can't learn anything from success; you only learn from failure.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Learning from Failure</h2>
  <p>Some of the greatest personalities of our time have learned from their failures. Thomas Edison once said, 'I have not failed; I have just found 10,000 ways that won't work.' Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, had several failures before he hit success. His earlier projects, Zip2 and PayPal, both failed before he succeeded with Tesla and SpaceX.</p>
  
  <p>My personal story is a humble addition to this discussion. I was repeatedly rejected by different publications when I was trying to start my writing career. I wasn't a talented writer. I was just determined to learn from every single rejection. Every time, I would carefully analyze the criticism, and use it to improve. Finally, after several years of hard work, I achieved my goal of getting published. It was my failures that taught me how to succeed.</p>
  <h2>Why We Only Learn from Failure</h2>
  <p>There is a simple reason why failure teaches us more than success. When we succeed, we tend to overlook the process that led us to success. We don't take note of nuances since we didn't have to give them too much attention. Failure forces us to analyze every step, and the missteps that led us there.</p>
  <h2>What Can We Learn from Failure</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>We learn how to cope with setbacks.</li>
   <li>We learn to appreciate the value of hard work and resilience.</li>
   <li>We learn how to avoid making similar mistakes in the future.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>It is okay to fail.</li>
   <li>Learn from your failures.</li>
   <li>Use your experiences to find your own unique path to success.</li>
  </ol>
