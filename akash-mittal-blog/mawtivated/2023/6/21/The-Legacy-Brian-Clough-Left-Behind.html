   <p>It was 1975. The football club, Nottingham Forest, had just secured promotion to the First Division. In his first season as manager, Brian Clough had achieved what many thought was impossible. However, it was not just the promotion that was impressive; it was the way in which he did it.</p>
   <p>Clough was notorious for his strict discipline and no-nonsense approach. He instilled a sense of pride and passion in his players, making them believe they could achieve anything. He was not afraid to ruffle some feathers when it came to his team selection either. If a player was not performing, regardless of their reputation, they were dropped.</p>
   <p>His approach may have seemed harsh, but it worked. Nottingham Forest went on to win the First Division the following season, and then went on to win the European Cup twice in a row. He left a legacy that is still felt today, not just at Nottingham Forest, but across the footballing world.</p>
   <h2>The Contribution of Brian Clough</h2>
   <p>Throughout his career, Brian Clough was not interested in the accolades that came with the job. Instead, he focused on contributing to the footballing world. Clough wanted to leave a lasting legacy that would inspire the next generation of footballers and managers.</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>"I want no epitaphs of profound history and all that type of thing. I contributed. I would hope they would say that, and I would hope somebody liked me."</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>Clough's contribution to the footballing world is immeasurable. He not only won trophies, but he changed the way football was played and managed. His approach may have been seen as controversial at times, but it paved the way for a new era of football. He was not just a manager, but a pioneer.</p>
   
   <p>One of the most inspiring aspects of Brian Clough's story is his humility. He never wanted the spotlight, but he always delivered when it was on him. Clough believed in hard work and dedication. His famous quote, "I wouldn't say I was the best manager in the business. But I was in the top one," is a testament to his belief in himself and his team.</p>
   <p>However, his passion for the game often led him into trouble. He was known for his clashes with referees and rival managers, but it was all in the name of his team. He wanted to win and he would do anything to achieve it. His players loved him for it and they would go to war for him on the pitch.</p>
