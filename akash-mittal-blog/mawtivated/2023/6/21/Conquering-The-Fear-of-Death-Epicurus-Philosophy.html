    <h2>An Inspiring Story of Living Life with No Regrets</h2>
    <p>Mark was a successful businessman in his early thirties. He had everything in life - a great job, a loving wife, two beautiful kids, and a luxurious home. But he wasn't happy. He realized that he was living life in a routine, not really cherishing the little moments of joy that life had to offer.</p>
    <p>One day, he woke up feeling sick and went to the doctor. After running some tests, the doctor informed him that he had been diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer and had only a few months left to live. This news shattered Mark's world, but it also woke him up from his slumber. He realized that he had been living life for others and not himself, and that he had forgotten the true meaning of happiness.</p>
    <p>Mark quit his job and started ticking off his bucket list. He traveled the world, went skydiving, wrote a book, and spent quality time with his loved ones. He lived every day as it was his last, and when his time came, he passed away with no regrets.</p>
    <p>Mark's story is a testament that life is short, and we should not take it for granted. We should live every day to the fullest and cherish the little moments of joy that come our way.</p>

    <h2>Who is Epicurus?</h2>
    <blockquote>
     "Death does not concern us, because as long as we exist, death is not here. And when it does come, we no longer exist." - Epicurus
    </blockquote>
    <p>Epicurus was an ancient Greek philosopher who focused on leading a happy and peaceful life. He founded the school of philosophy called Epicureanism, which emphasized the importance of happiness and the pursuit of pleasure as the ultimate goal of human life.</p>
    <p>For Epicurus, the fear of death was irrational because it came from the belief that death is harmful to us. He believed that our fear of death was due to our misconception of what death truly is. Death is nothing but the end of our existence, and we cannot feel any pain or pleasure once we are dead.</p>

    <h2>Epicurus' Philosophy on Death and Life</h2>
    <h3>1. Live for the Present</h3>
    <p>Epicurus believed that the key to a happy life was to focus on the present moment. We should not worry about the future or dwell on the past. We should cherish the moments of joy that life has to offer and enjoy them to the fullest.</p>
    <h3>2. Pursue Pleasure and Avoid Pain</h3>
    <p>Epicurus believed that pleasure was the ultimate good and that we should pursue it in our lives. He emphasized that we should avoid pain and seek out those pleasures that bring us peace of mind and happiness without harming others.</p>
    <h3>3. Death is Nothing to Fear</h3>
    <p>Epicurus believed that we should embrace death as a natural part of life. Death is nothing but the end of our existence, and we should not fear it because it cannot harm us. We should focus on living our lives to the fullest and cherish the moments of joy and happiness that come our way.</p>
