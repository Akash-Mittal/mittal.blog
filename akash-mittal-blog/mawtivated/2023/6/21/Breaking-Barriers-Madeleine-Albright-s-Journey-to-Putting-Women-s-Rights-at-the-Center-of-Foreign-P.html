She brought a new perspective to U.S. policy, that women should be heard, respected, and be given the same rights as men.</p>
  <p>Albright drew attention to gender-based violence, trafficking, and employment and provided visibility for underrepresented groups.

This tenacity and courage to challenge the status quo set a new standard and opened doors to opportunities for women.</p>
