  <h1>The Alluring Journey of Love: Why it trumps Marriage</h1></br> <img src="images/The-Alluring-Journey-of-Love-Why-it-trumps-Marriage.jpeg" alt="+The-Alluring-Journey-of-Love-Why-it-trumps-Marriage+"></br>
  <p>Love is more pleasant than marriage for the same reason that novels are more amusing than history â€“ as Nicolas Chamfort once said. But what makes love more pleasant, and marriage less? It is something that has been debated over years and has intrigued many to seek the answers that lie within the realms of love.</p>
  <p>A story that has continued to inspire me, is the tale of a young couple who fell in love at first sight. They were both young and in college, mesmerized by the wonders of curiosity that true love brings. However, things didn't go as planned as one of them had to move far away, and they had to make a difficult choice - to either call it quits or to make it work. The two young college students decided to make their love work, and it did! Several years later, they still have butterflies in their stomachs when they look into each other's eyes. Love has kept them together for all these years, and this is just one of the many reasons why love triumphs over marriage.</p>
  <h2>The Beauty of Love</h2>
  <p>Love is refreshing, beautiful, and full of surprises. When you are in love, your mind and body are filled with an array of emotions. You feel passion, excitement, and exhilaration, all intertwined into an infatuation that is undeniable. Love is like a drug that you can't resist, and it takes you on a remarkable journey of discovery and pleasure.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, marriage is more focused on commitment, responsibilities, and routines. It is not as thrilling or intense as love that is raw and untamed. Marriage is a decision that people make to build a life with someone. Don't get me wrong; marriage can be beautiful, but it lacks the spontaneity and excitement that love brings.</p>
  <h2>The Importance of Personal Freedom</h2>
  <p>One of the reasons why love trumps marriage is a matter of personal freedom. Love gives you the freedom to be yourself, to explore, to take risks without feeling the pressure of societal expectations. When you are in love, you are not impeded by the burden of the day to day responsibilities that come with marriage. Instead, you are free to be yourself, to explore and learn about each other, and to foster a meaningful connection.</p>
  <p>Marriage, on the other hand, has defined roles and expectations that may hinder your growth as an individual. When you get married, you must adhere to the societal expectation of domestic expectations such as cooking regular meals, keeping the house clean, and maintaining a healthy family bond. While these expectations are an integral part of building a family unit, they may also lead to a loss of personal freedom.</p>
  <h2>Consent to Love</h2>
  <p>When you love someone, you have the freedom and consent to give yourself to another person. It is a choice made out of your free will, without nagging or societal pressure. You don't have to explain or make someone else happy because loving someone brings your happiness, too.</p>
  <p>Marriage, on the other hand, may be a product of societal expectations or family pressure. It is more of a contract than an act of free will and choice. When you get married, you are fulfilling societal expectations that may not necessarily reflect your inner desire to be with someone.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>It is imperative to note that there is no right or wrong answer to the question of love versus marriage. However, through personal experiences and study, we can draw the conclusion that love is, indeed more pleasant than marriage. Here are three points summing up the reasons why love trumps marriage:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Love is refreshing, beautiful, and full of surprises.</li>
   <li>Love grants you the freedom to be yourself, to explore, and to take risks without feeling the burden of societal expectations.</li>
   <li>Love is a conscious decision made out of free will, while marriage may be a product of societal or family expectations.</li>
  </ul>
