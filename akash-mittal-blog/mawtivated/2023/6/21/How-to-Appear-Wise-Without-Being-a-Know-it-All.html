   <p>There was a man named Jack who was considered to be one of the wisest men in his town. Everyone would come to him for advice on various topics such as business, relationships, and life in general.</p>
   <p>One day, a young man came to Jack seeking advice on how to become wise like him. To this, Jack replied, "Never seem wiser, nor more learned, than the people you are with. Wear your learning, like your watch, in a private pocket: and do not merely pull it out and strike it merely to show that you have one."</p>
   <p>This advice given by Jack is a wonderful example of how one can display their knowledge without seeming like a know-it-all. Here are some practical tips to help you appear wise:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Listen more, talk less.</strong> People appreciate when you take time to understand their point of views instead of just waiting for them to finish talking so you can respond. By listening more, you can gain more knowledge and insights.</li>
    <li><strong>Avoid being judgmental.</strong> Being open-minded about people's perspectives, beliefs, and traditions can help you learn new things that you never knew existed. Forming opinions beforehand can stop you from learning and understanding new concepts.</li>
    <li><strong>Be humble.</strong> When you show humility, people will be more willing to listen to what you have to say. Humility is a trait that is admired and respected.</li>
    <li><strong>Share knowledge only if asked.</strong> Instead of imposing your knowledge on others, offer it when they ask for it. This shows that you respect their views and are willing to help them understand better.</li>
    <li><strong>Take criticisms positively.</strong> Criticisms are not always meant to be negative. They can give you an insight into what areas you can improve in. Taking them positively will make you a better listener and a better communicator.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Lord Chesterfield, an 18th-century British statesman, once said, "If you are not in somebody's way, you are not a roadblock". This quote emphasizes the fact that being humble and showing respect for others' opinions can go a long way in building positive relationships and helping you learn new things.</p>
   <p>In his time, Lord Chesterfield was known for his exceptional wit and his skills in communication and etiquette. He believed that the key to success in life was to be intelligent, well-mannered, and socially savvy, which are traits that he tried to instill in his son.</p>
   <p>Here are some examples of how his advice can be applied:</p>

    <p>"The difference between a man of sense and a fop is that the fop values himself upon his dress, and the man of sense laughs at it, at the same time he knows he must not neglect it."</p>

   <p>This quote by Earl of Chesterfield emphasizes the importance of dressing appropriately while not valuing oneself solely based on it. This applies to all aspects of life, where one should always focus on their inner qualities without neglecting external ones.</p>
   <blockquote cite="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/philip_stanhope_144720">
    <p>"Many a good cow has a bad calf, and many a good sermon has a bad delivery."</p>

   </blockquote>
   <p>This quote by Earl of Chesterfield emphasizes that even the best ideas can fail due to lack of communication skills. Therefore, it is important to pay attention to how you deliver your ideas and messages.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, appearing wise is not about flaunting your knowledge or acting like a know-it-all. Instead, it's about being humble, respectful, and a good listener. These traits will help you build positive relationships while also gain knowledge and insights. To summarize, here are three key takeaways:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Listen more, talk less.</li>
    <li>Be open-minded and avoid being judgmental.</li>
    <li>Show humility and respect others' opinions.</li>
   </ol>
