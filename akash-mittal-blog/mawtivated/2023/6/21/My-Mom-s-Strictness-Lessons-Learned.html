    <p>It was a hot summer day, and I was on my way to the park with my friends. We planned to play basketball for hours until the sun started to set. As I was leaving the house, my mom called out to me from the porch. "Don't forget your sunscreen and water, and be back before 7 pm," she said with a stern voice. I rolled my eyes and waved goodbye, feeling annoyed at her care and rules that seemed unnecessary to me at the time.</p>
    <p>Little did I know that my mom's strictness and discipline would shape me into the person I am today. Her love and guidance were always there, even if I didn't understand it at the time. Looking back, I realize how fortunate I was to have a mom who cared for my wellbeing and future.</p>

    <h2>The Power of a Strict Parenting Style</h2>
    <p>As children, we often rebel against rules and boundaries, seeking independence and freedom. However, research shows that a strict parenting style can have positive effects on children's development and success.</p>
    <blockquote>
     "The most successful children have parents who are both demanding and responsive. Demanding means setting high standards and expecting achievement from children. Responsive means providing warmth, support, and openness to their children's needs. Put the two together and you get the authoritative style of parenting."
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Gloria Estefan: A Success Story of Strict Parenting</h2>
    <p>Gloria Estefan, a Cuban-American singer, actress, and entrepreneur, is a prime example of how strict parenting can lead to greatness. Growing up, her mom would wake her up at 5 am to practice piano before school, and her dad would give her tough love during track and field practice.</p>
    <p>Despite the strictness, Gloria's parents instilled in her a strong work ethic, determination, and love for music. She began singing and playing guitar with her family's band and eventually formed the Miami Sound Machine. Today, Gloria is a seven-time Grammy award winner and one of the most successful Latin crossover artists in music history.</p>
