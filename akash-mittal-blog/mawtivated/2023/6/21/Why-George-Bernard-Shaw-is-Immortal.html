    <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
    <p>George Bernard Shaw was born in Ireland in 1856. Despite coming from a poor family, Shaw was determined to become a writer. He started off as a journalist, but it wasn't until his play "Arms and the Man" was produced in 1894 that he achieved success as a playwright. Over the course of his career, Shaw wrote more than 60 plays, including "Pygmalion" (1912), which was later adapted into the musical "My Fair Lady." In addition to his plays, Shaw was also a prolific essayist and critic, and a passionate advocate for political and social reform.</p>

    <h2>The Personality of George Bernard Shaw</h2>
    <p>Max Beerbohm once said, "As a teacher, as a propagandist, Mr. Shaw is no good at all, even in his own generation. But as a personality, he is immortal." This statement is a testament to Shaw's enduring legacy and influence in the world of literature and politics. Shaw was known for his wit and humor, his outspoken opinions on a wide range of topics, and his dedication to causes such as women's rights and socialism.</p>
    <p>Shaw's personality was so strong that it often overshadowed his work as a writer. He was a master of the quip and the one-liner, and had a talent for cutting through pretense and exposing the flaws in society. For example, when someone asked him if he believed in free love, Shaw responded, "Certainly, as long as it's not compulsory."</p>
