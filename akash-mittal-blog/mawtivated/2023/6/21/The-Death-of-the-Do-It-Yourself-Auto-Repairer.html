   <p>It was a Saturday morning and John was ready to tackle his latest DIY project. He had decided to change the oil on his car himself, something he had always done on his own. However, as soon as he popped the hood, he realized things were different. The engine was covered in plastic and he couldn't even see the oil filter. Confused, he took to Google to figure out what was going on and learned that the days of the DIY auto repair were long gone.</p>
   <p>This story is becoming more and more common. As cars have become more complex, the ability for the average person to repair their own vehicle has diminished. This is not just due to the rise of electric and hybrid vehicles, but because of the high software content found in traditional gasoline-powered cars. In fact, it's estimated that more than 30% of the cost of a new car today is due to its software content.</p>
   <h2>The Rise of Software in Cars</h2>
   <p>Before we dive into the death of the DIY auto repairer, it's important to understand how software has become so important in modern cars. The use of software in vehicles has been steadily increasing since the 1970s, primarily to control the engine and other mechanical systems. However, it wasn't until the rise of the computer in the 1990s that software became a central part of the car.</p>
   <p>Today, software is used in virtually every system in the car, from the engine to the entertainment system. Cars today have more lines of code than the software used to control the Apollo spacecraft. This is because modern cars have to do more than just get us from point A to point B. They have to be constantly connected to the internet, receive real-time traffic updates, and even update their own software over the air.</p>
   <h2>The Death of the DIY Auto Repairer</h2>
   <p>So, what does this all mean for the average person who wants to repair their own car? It means that unless you have advanced technical knowledge, specialized tools, and access to proprietary software, you're not going to be able to repair your car yourself. While you may be able to change your oil or replace a tire, anything beyond that will require a trip to the dealership or an independent mechanic.</p>
   <p>This has significant implications, not just for car enthusiasts, but for the economy as a whole. The ability to repair your own car has traditionally been seen as a way to save money and develop technical skills. With the rise of software, this ability is disappearing. This means that people will have to pay more for repairs and may be discouraged from learning technical skills that could lead to high-paying jobs.</p>
   <h2>Examples</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>When the Tesla Model X was released, it had a problem with its falcon-wing doors not opening. While a traditional mechanic may have been able to fix this problem, it required a software update that could only be done by a Tesla technician.</li>
    <li>The Ford F-150 has an aluminum body, which requires specialized tools and training to repair. This means that even if you have experience repairing other vehicles, you may not be able to repair a Ford F-150 on your own.</li>
    <li>The 2022 Chevrolet Bolt EV features General Motors' latest Ultium battery technology. While the batteries are designed to be interchangeable, they require proprietary software to operate. This means that even if you have the technical knowledge to replace the battery, you won't be able to do it without access to the software.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>The days of the DIY auto repairer are gone, thanks to the high software content found in modern cars.</li>
    <li>This has significant implications for the economy as a whole, as people may be discouraged from developing technical skills.</li>
    <li>While it may be frustrating to not be able to repair your own car, it's important to recognize that cars have become more complex for a reason. Software has allowed cars to become safer, more efficient, and more connected than ever before.</li>
