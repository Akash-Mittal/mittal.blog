    <h3>The Story of How Green Bananas Saved My Day</h3>
    <p>It was a busy day and I was rushing to get home from the supermarket. I had picked up a bunch of bananas but they were all ripe and would probably not last long. While looking for something else, I stumbled upon a bunch of green bananas. I remembered reading somewhere that green bananas are much better for cooking and are also healthier. I decided to buy them and the rest is history. By the time I got home, the bananas had become perfectly ripe and they were delicious.</p>
