   <h2>An Inspiring Story from Robert Frost</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <blockquote>
    <p>"You don't have to deserve your mother's love. You have to deserve your father's."</p>
    <p>- Robert Frost</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>Robert Frost, one of the greatest American poets of the 20th century, once said these words about the difference between mother's love and father's love. Though they are both the love of parents, they feel and express it differently. For a child, mother's love is an unconditional bond that they give freely without any expectation. On the other hand, the father's love is earned by their children through their behavior, actions and accomplishments. In this article, we will discuss the meaning behind Robert Frost's wise words, and how they apply to our daily lives.</p>
   <h3>The Importance of Father's Love</h3>
   <p>Every child desires to have the love and acceptance of their father. It is the foundation of their self-worth and self-esteem. When a child feels that their father loves and approves of them, it gives them the courage and motivation to pursue their dreams and goals. Fathers are the role models, teachers, and mentors who guide their children to become responsible and successful adults. They instill the values of hard work, perseverance, and discipline that shape their character and shape their future. If a father is absent or indifferent, a child may look for love and acceptance in other ways or fall into despair or self-destructive behavior.</p>
   <h3>The Challenges of Earning Father's Love</h3>
   <p>It's not easy to earn the love and approval of your father. It requires consistent effort and hard work. You must show that you are worthy of their trust and respect by being honest, reliable, and responsible. You must listen to their advice and follow their rules without questioning or rebelling. You must excel in your studies, sports, or hobbies and make them proud of your achievements. You must be willing to sacrifice your own interests and desires for the sake of the family and community. If you fail to meet their expectations or make mistakes, you must own up to them, apologize, and make amends. Only by doing so, can you gain the recognition and praise that your father gives to you.</p>
   <h3>The Value of Mother's Love</h3>
   <p>Just because the father's love is earned, it doesn't mean that the mother's love is less important or valuable. In fact, the mother's love is the most nurturing and unconditional type of love that a child can ever receive. It's the kind of love that is patient, forgiving, and selfless, that endures through all hardships and difficulties. Unlike the father, the mother doesn't judge or evaluate their children based on their behavior or accomplishments. They accept them as they are, flaws and all, and provide them with the emotional support and comfort they need to face life's challenges. They are the ones who kiss away tears, cook soup when they're sick, tell bedtime stories, and celebrate birthdays and holidays with joy and love.</p>
   <h3>The Challenge of Expressing Father's Love</h3>
   <p>For fathers, expressing their love isn't always easy. They may find it hard to express their feelings in words, or they may feel embarrassed or awkward showing affection. They may think that their actions speak louder than words and assume that their children understand their love. However, children need to hear it and feel it from their fathers. It's not enough to assume that they know. Fathers need to say "I love you" to their children and show them through hugs, kisses, and other physical contact. They need to spend quality time with them, playing games, going on outings, and having heart-to-heart conversations. They need to show interest in their lives, ask questions, and listen attentively. Only by doing so, can they make a lasting impact on their children's lives and create happy memories that they will cherish forever.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>1. A father's love is earned through behavior and actions, while a mother's love is unconditional.</li>
    <li>2. Both types of love are important for a child's well-being and development.</li>
    <li>3. Fathers need to express their love through words and actions to create a strong bond with their children.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Remember, it's never too late to strengthen the bond with your father or to express your love and appreciation for all that they have done for you. Take the time to reflect on the relationship with your father, and reach out to him in a way that shows your love and respect. Remember, a little effort goes a long way in building a meaningful relationship.</p>
