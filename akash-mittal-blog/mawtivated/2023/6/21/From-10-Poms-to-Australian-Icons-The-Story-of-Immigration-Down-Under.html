    <h2>The £10 Pom Scheme</h2>
    <p>In the late 1940s, the Australian government launched the £10 Pom Scheme. The aim of the scheme was to attract people from Britain and Canada to migrate to Australia. The scheme earned its name from the cost of the one-way ticket, which was £10. The scheme ran until 1972 and brought around 1.5 million people to Australia.</p>
    <p>Many of the people who migrated to Australia during the scheme were skilled workers who were in demand in the growing economy. The scheme played a significant role in shaping the social, economic, and cultural landscape of Australia.</p>
