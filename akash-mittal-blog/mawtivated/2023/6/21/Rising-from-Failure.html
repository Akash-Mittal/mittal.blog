  <h1>Rising from Failure</h1></br> <img src="images/Rising-from-Failure.jpeg" alt="+Rising-from-Failure+"></br>
  <p>Everyone fails at some point in their lives. It's a natural part of the learning process. However, it's not the end of the world. In fact, it's an opportunity to learn, grow and become stronger through the experience. As Ralph Waldo Emerson said:</p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>"Our greatest glory is not in never failing, but in rising up every time we fail."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This quote rings true for many successful people who have experienced multiple setbacks before achieving success. Michael Jordan was cut from his high school basketball team, Bill Gates' first business failed, and Oprah Winfrey was fired from her job as a TV anchor. Yet, all three individuals learned from their failures and persisted until they achieved their goals.</p>
  <h2>Author - Ralph Waldo Emerson Story</h2>
  <p>Ralph Waldo Emerson was an American essayist, poet and lecturer. He was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1803 and graduated from Harvard in 1821. Emerson went on to become a prominent figure in American literature and was known for his speeches and essays on topics such as individualism, self-reliance and transcendentalism. His most well-known works include "Nature," "Self-Reliance," and "The American Scholar." Emerson's writing has inspired countless individuals to become their own person and forge their own path in life.</p>
  <h2>Why Failure is Important</h2>
  <p>Failure is a necessary part of the learning process. It teaches resilience, perseverance and grit. Without failure, success wouldn't be as meaningful. It's important to embrace failure and learn from it in order to grow and become a better person.</p>
  <h3>Examples of Successful People who Overcame Failure</h3>
  <ul>
   <li>Thomas Edison – Inventor of the light bulb. Failed over 1,000 times before achieving success.</li>
   <li>Walt Disney – Founder of Disney. Was fired from his first job for "lack of creativity."</li>
   <li>Stephen King – Best-selling author. His first novel was rejected 30 times before being published.</li>
   <li>J.K. Rowling – Author of the Harry Potter series. Was rejected by 12 publishers before finally being accepted.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All of these successful people could have given up after their initial failures. Instead, they persisted and continued to work hard until they achieved their goals. This kind of resilience is what separates successful people from those who give up at the first sign of failure.</p>
