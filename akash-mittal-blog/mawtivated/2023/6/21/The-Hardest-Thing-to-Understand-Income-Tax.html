   <p>Have you ever gone over your pay stub or W-2 form and felt like you're deciphering an alien language? You're not alone. For many people, income tax can be a complicated and overwhelming process, leaving them feeling stressed and unsure if they did it correctly.</p>
   <p>However, understanding income tax is important. If you don't, you could miss out on potential deductions and credits, resulting in overpaying or even underpaying taxes. So, let's dive into this topic and try to make some sense of it.</p>
   <h2>The Basics</h2>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Gross Income:</strong> This is your total income before any deductions or taxes are taken out.</li>
    <li><strong>Adjusted Gross Income (AGI):</strong> This is your gross income minus certain deductions such as IRA contributions or student loan interest.</li>
    <li><strong>Taxable Income:</strong> This is the income you pay taxes on after taking out deductions.</li>
    <li><strong>Tax Bracket:</strong> This determines how much you'll pay in federal income tax. Your taxable income falls into a certain tax bracket with its own tax rate.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Figuring out these terms can be a good starting point when understanding income tax.</p>
   <h2>Common Deductions and Credits</h2>
   <p>Now that we've gone over some basic terms, let's look at some common deductions and credits.</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Standard Deduction:</strong> This is a fixed dollar amount that can be subtracted from your taxable income. For 2021, the standard deduction for single filers is $12,550 and $25,100 for married couples filing jointly.</li>
    <li><strong>Itemized Deductions:</strong> These are expenses that can reduce your taxable income such as mortgage interest, charitable donations, and medical expenses.</li>
    <li><strong>Tax Credits:</strong> These are direct reductions of your taxes owed. Some common tax credits include the Child Tax Credit, Earned Income Tax Credit, and American Opportunity Tax Credit.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>There are many more deductions and credits available, so it's important to research and see which ones you may be eligible for.</p>
   <h2>Author - Albert Einstein</h2>
   <p>Albert Einstein, the brilliant physicist, is known for many of his famous quotes. However, not many know that he also had trouble understanding income tax. As one of the most intelligent people to ever live, it's almost comforting to know that even he struggled with income tax.</p>
   <h2>Real-Life Example</h2>
   <p>Samantha is a freelance writer and had a gross income of $70,000 for the year. She contributed $5,000 to her IRA and paid $3,000 in student loan interest. Using the formula, her AGI would be $62,000 ($70,000 - $5,000 - $3,000). After taking the standard deduction of $12,550, her taxable income would be $49,450. According to the federal tax brackets, she would fall into the 22% tax bracket, resulting in $7,548.50 in federal income tax owed for the year.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, here are three important points to keep in mind when it comes to income tax:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Understanding the basic terms and concepts is crucial.</li>
    <li>Researching and taking advantage of deductions and credits can save you money.</li>
    <li>Don't be too hard on yourself. Even Albert Einstein had trouble with income tax.</li>
   </ol>
