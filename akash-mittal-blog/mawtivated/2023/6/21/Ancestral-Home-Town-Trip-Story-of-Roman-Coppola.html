   <p>It's a dream come true for many of us to visit our ancestral home town someday. Roman Coppola, the renowned director, producer, and storyteller, had this opportunity recently when he visited Bernalda, his dad's hometown in Italy. His father, Francis Ford Coppola, has just refurbished a palazzo and turned it into a hotel. Roman shares his exciting experience with us, and let us dive into his journey of exploring his origins.</p>
   <h2>Discovering Bernalda</h2>
   <p>As Roman arrived in Bernalda, he realized that the town holds immense heritage value. It's a small and picturesque medieval town located on top of a hill in the Basilicata region of Southern Italy. Roman's family history apparently dates back to several generations in Bernalda, and many of his relatives still reside there.</p>
   <p>"Bernalda is a charming Italian town that I had always felt connected to, even though I hadn't been there for many years. It was a pleasure for me to spend time there again, walk around the town square, admire the beautiful architecture, and visit places that are special to my family," Roman shares.</p>
   <h2>The Palazzo-turned-Hotel</h2>
   <p>The real reason for Roman's visit to Bernalda was to attend his sister's wedding, which took place in the palazzo his father had recently refurbished and turned into a luxurious hotel. The palazzo had been in the Coppola family for generations, and they had preserved its heritage and beauty while bringing modern amenities to its guests.</p>
   <blockquote>
    "It was emotional seeing the property transformed into a hotel and filled with people. The rooms were all breathtaking, each with their unique design and style. Walking through the palazzo, it was amazing to think how many historical moments had taken place within those walls, and now it would be the site of my sister's wedding," Roman reminisces.
   </blockquote>
   <h2>Exploring the Land and Culture</h2>
   <p>During his trip to Italy, Roman also explored the country's culture, food, and wine. He visited several vineyards, tasted the local cuisine, and met many interesting people.</p>
   <p>"The people in Bernalda were so warm and welcoming, and it was a unique experience to be able to spend time with relatives I hadn't seen in years. Getting to know the community and learning about the history and traditions was enriching," he shares.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Visiting your ancestral home town can be an enriching and emotional experience.</li>
    <li>Preserving heritage and history is crucial to maintaining cultural identity.</li>
    <li>Learning about the local culture, food, and wine can be a valuable way to connect with the people and the place.</li>
