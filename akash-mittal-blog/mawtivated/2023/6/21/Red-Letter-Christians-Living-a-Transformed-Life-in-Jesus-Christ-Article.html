  <p>It was a dark and stormy night. Tony Campolo had just come back from a speaking engagement in the Philippines, and he was tired and jet-lagged. He went to bed early, hoping to get a good night's rest, but he was awakened by a knock on the door. It was a group of street kids who saw his light on and thought he might have something to eat. Tony invited them in and offered them food and a place to sleep. As he was tucking them in, he realized that he was living out the words of Jesus, who said, "As you did it to one of the least of these my brothers and sisters, you did it to me."</p>
  <p>That experience changed Tony's life. It inspired him to create a movement of Christians who are committed to living like Jesus in every aspect of their lives. He called them "Red Letter Christians" because they believe that the words of Jesus, which are often printed in red letters in Bibles, should be the foundation of their faith.</p>
  <h2>What is a Red Letter Christian?</h2>
  <p>A Red Letter Christian is someone who takes the words of Jesus seriously. They believe that Jesus' teachings on love, justice, and peace are not just for Sunday mornings or private devotions, but for every aspect of their lives.</p>
  <p>Red Letter Christians believe in the doctrines of the Apostle's Creed, are convinced that the Scriptures have been inspired by the Holy Spirit, and make having a personal relationship with the resurrected Christ the touchstone of their faith. But they also believe that faith without works is dead, and they seek to live out their faith by serving others and working for justice in their communities.</p>
  <h2>Living a Transformed Life</h2>
  <p>Red Letter Christians believe that following Jesus should result in a transformed life. They recognize that they are sinners saved by grace, but they also believe that Jesus' death and resurrection have the power to change them from the inside out.</p>
  <p>One of the ways that Red Letter Christians seek to live out their faith is by serving those who are marginalized and oppressed. This may mean feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, or visiting the sick and imprisoned. Red Letter Christians believe that Jesus calls them to love their neighbors as themselves, and to see the face of Jesus in those who are in need.</p>
  <p>Another way that Red Letter Christians seek to live out their faith is by working for justice in their communities. This may mean advocating for policies that protect the environment, fighting against racism and discrimination, or standing up for the rights of the poor and vulnerable. Red Letter Christians believe that Jesus calls them to be peacemakers and to work for the common good.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Red Letter Christians</h2>
  <p>There are many examples of Red Letter Christians throughout history, including Mother Teresa, Martin Luther King Jr., Dorothy Day, and Shane Claiborne.</p>
  <p>Mother Teresa was a Catholic nun who dedicated her life to serving the poor in Calcutta, India. She believed that by loving and serving the poorest of the poor, she was serving Jesus himself.</p>
  <p>Martin Luther King Jr. was a Baptist minister who fought against racism and discrimination in the United States. He believed that Jesus' teachings on love and justice required him to work for racial equality and to speak out against injustice.</p>
  <p>Dorothy Day was a Catholic journalist and social activist who co-founded the Catholic Worker movement, which sought to serve the poor and promote social justice. She believed that by living a simple and radical life of love and service, she was following in the footsteps of Jesus.</p>
  <p>Shane Claiborne is a Christian author and activist who lives in a intentional community in Philadelphia. He has worked on a variety of social justice issues, including homelessness, the death penalty, and the war in Iraq. He believes that Jesus' teachings on love, peace, and justice require him to be an activist and a peacemaker.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, Red Letter Christians are committed to living like Jesus in every aspect of their lives. They believe that by serving others, working for justice, and following Jesus' teachings on love, they can make a real difference in the world.</p>
  <p>Three practical tips for living like a Red Letter Christian are:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Get involved in your community by volunteering at a local shelter, food bank, or community organization.</li>
   <li>Advocate for policies that promote justice and protect the environment.</li>
   <li>Read the words of Jesus and think about how you can apply them to your daily life.</li>
