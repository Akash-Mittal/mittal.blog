  <p>Imagine you are a person with a physical disability. You need a wheelchair to move around. One day, you visit a hospital for a checkup, and to your surprise, the hospital has no wheelchair ramp to enter the building. You struggle to climb the stairs and finally enter, but the doctor's cabin is on the first floor, and once again, you have to climb the stairs. You feel embarrassed, and it is painful.</p>
  <p>Access to technology, which can improve people's lives and quality of living, should not be segregated. Technology advances to improve and facilitate people's lives, and human rights are an integral part of ensuring that advancing technology is being used responsibility.</p>
  <p>John Charles Polanyi, a Hungarian-Canadian physical chemist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1986. He advocated for human rights and used his scientific research to develop technology for the sole purpose of improving living conditions.</p>
  <h2>Human Rights - Integral to Science and Scholarship</h2>
  <blockquote>
   "The respect for human rights, essential if we are to use technology wisely, is not something alien that must be grafted onto science. On the contrary, it is integral to science, as also to scholarship in general. "
  </blockquote>
  <p>Polanyi's statement emphasized the importance of human rights in science and technology. Humanity should not be a mere afterthought, and the focus should only be around profit and innovation. Technology should not make human life more challenging, but instead, it should aid and uplift the human experience. An inclusive system that takes care of human rights can lead to sustainability, inclusiveness, and a better world for everyone.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Neglecting Human Rights in Technology</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>Facial Recognition Bias - Human Rights concerns have been raised, as facial recognition technology has errors in recognizing people of color and those with darker skin tones (Buolamwini and Gebru W, 2018).</li>
   <li>Surveillance Culture - In recent years, government surveillance, data breaches, unauthorized monitoring, and other forms of cyber threats have increased (Pew Research Center, 2021).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These two examples demonstrate that technology can create problems. Therefore, a human-centric approach should be taken when creating technology, so everyone is equally benefited and not just a particular group.</p>
  <h2>How to Incorporate Human Rights in Technology</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>Proper Research - before creating any technology, research should be the first step. Determine the ethical, social context, political impact, and the consequences that could arise from using the technology.</li>
   <li>Transparency - Companies and government should be transparent about how technology works, how they collect, and use user data. Transparency ensures that trust is maintained.</li>
   <li>Involve affected groups - When creating technology that is intended for a specific group; involve them in the designing process. Involved groups will provide better insight into what they need</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>To ensure that technology is used wisely, human rights must be respected, and this must be integrated into its development. Technology, along with human rights, can improve living standards and bring a positive impact to society. Without respecting human rights, technology can lead to injustice and social inequalities. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the creators of technology and innovators to respect human rights when developing technology and to ensure their developments benefit everyone equally.</p><br>
