   <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
   <p>There was a young man named John who was about to graduate from college. He was determined to become a successful businessman and make a lot of money. However, one day he met an elderly man who told him a story that changed his life.</p>
   <blockquote>
    "Son, I have seen many successful businessmen in my time, but I have also seen many miserable ones. The ones who were truly happy were the ones who did good with their money. They gave back to their communities, helped others less fortunate, and made the world a better place. Money will bring you power, but goodness will bring you fulfillment."
   </blockquote>
   <p>John was touched by the man's words and decided to dedicate his life to doing good. He started a nonprofit organization that helped provide education and healthcare for disadvantaged children. He didn't become a billionaire, but he found joy and purpose in his work.</p>
   <h2>The Importance of Being Good</h2>
   <p>Victor Hugo, the famous French author, once said, "Well, for us, in history where goodness is a rare pearl, he who was good almost takes precedence over he who was great." In a world that often values success and achievement over everything else, it's easy to forget the importance of being good.</p>
   <p>Being good means more than just following the rules or being polite. It means having empathy for others, being honest and trustworthy, and treating everyone with respect and kindness. Being good also means doing the right thing, even when it's difficult or unpopular.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Being Good</h2>
   <p>There are many examples of people who have made a difference in the world by being good. Here are just a few:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Mahatma Gandhi:</strong> Gandhi fought for India's independence from Britain using nonviolent civil disobedience. He inspired millions with his message of peace and equality.</li>
    <li><strong>Mother Teresa:</strong> Mother Teresa dedicated her life to serving the poorest of the poor. She founded the Missionaries of Charity, a religious congregation that helps people in need all over the world.</li>
    <li><strong>Martin Luther King Jr.:</strong> Martin Luther King Jr. was a leader in the American civil rights movement. He fought for racial justice and equality using nonviolent methods.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>These individuals were not necessarily rich, powerful, or famous. But they made a profound impact on the world by being good.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, being good should take precedence over being great. Here are three reasons why:</p>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>Goodness brings fulfillment:</strong> As the story of John shows, doing good can bring you joy and purpose in life. Money and success may bring temporary happiness, but true fulfillment comes from helping others.</li>
    <li><strong>Goodness inspires others:</strong> When we see someone doing good, it inspires us to do good too. Being a good person can have a ripple effect that spreads far beyond ourselves.</li>
    <li><strong>Goodness is timeless:</strong> Success may come and go, but being good is always in style. No matter how much the world may change, the importance of kindness and empathy will never go out of fashion.</li>
   </ol>
