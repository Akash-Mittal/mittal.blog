  <p>Once upon a time, there was an Idaho senior named Mary. She had recently retired and was looking forward to enjoying her golden years in comfort. However, after a routine check-up, she was prescribed a medication that cost $1,000 a month. Mary was shocked and worried; how could she afford this medication?</p>
  <p>As I travel around Idaho and visit with seniors like Mary, I hear almost universal concern about the rising cost of health care, particularly the cost of prescription drugs. It's a serious problem that is affecting seniors across the state.</p>
  <h2>The Rising Cost of Health Care</h2>
  <p>The cost of health care has been increasing steadily over the years, and it's taking a toll on seniors. According to a report by AARP, the average annual cost of health care for a senior is over $15,000. That's more than double the cost for someone under the age of 65.</p>
  <p>The rising cost of health care is due to a variety of factors, including the cost of medical technology, an aging population, and the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases. These factors make it difficult for seniors to afford the care they need to stay healthy.</p>
  <h2>The Cost of Prescription Drugs</h2>
  <p>The cost of prescription drugs is another major concern for seniors. Many seniors rely on medication to manage chronic conditions, and some of these medications can be incredibly expensive.</p>
  <p>For example, insulin, a medication that is critical for people with diabetes, has seen a 600% price increase over the past few decades. This means that many seniors who rely on insulin are struggling to afford it.</p>
  <p>In addition to the cost of medication, seniors are also facing rising costs for other health care services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and medical procedures. These costs can quickly add up and create financial strain for seniors who are on a fixed income.</p>
  <h2>The Impact on Idaho Seniors</h2>
  <p>The rising cost of health care and prescription drugs is having a significant impact on Idaho seniors. Many are struggling to afford the care they need to stay healthy, and some are even skipping medications or medical appointments because of the cost.</p>
  <p>This can have serious consequences for their health and well-being. For example, skipping medications can lead to complications and hospitalizations, which can be even more expensive in the long run. Seniors are also at risk of developing chronic conditions that can have a significant impact on their quality of life.</p>
  <h2>What Can We Do?</h2>
  <p>As a community, we need to work together to address the rising cost of health care and prescription drugs for Idaho seniors. Here are three things we can do:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Advocate for change: We can advocate for policy changes that will help make health care and prescription drugs more affordable for seniors. This can include measures like negotiating drug prices, expanding access to affordable care, and reducing out-of-pocket costs.</li>
   <li>Explore alternative options: There are alternative options available that can help seniors save money on their health care and prescription drugs. For example, seniors can explore generic medication options, participate in prescription assistance programs, or consider alternative treatments that may be more affordable.</li>
   <li>Stay informed: Seniors and their families can stay informed about changes in health care policy and prescription drug prices. This can help them make informed decisions about their health care and ensure they are getting the care they need at a price they can afford.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The rising cost of health care and prescription drugs is a major concern for Idaho seniors. It's a problem that is affecting the health and well-being of our community. However, by working together and taking action, we can help make health care and prescription drugs more affordable and accessible for seniors.</p>
