    <h2>Barry Commoner's Story</h2>
    <p>Barry Commoner was an American biologist, academic, and activist. He was a leading voice in the environmental movement and was known for his famous quote - "Environmental pollution is an incurable disease. It can only be prevented."</p>
    <p>Commoner's passion for the environment began in his childhood. He grew up in Brooklyn, New York, and witnessed the effects of pollution on the city's air and water. He went on to study biology and earned a PhD from Harvard University. In the 1950s, he became a professor at Washington University in St. Louis, where he continued his research on the effects of radiation on the environment and public health.</p>
    <p>Commoner's activism began in the 1960s, when he became involved in the fight against nuclear weapons and nuclear power. He argued that the use of nuclear energy was not only dangerous, but also expensive and unnecessary. He also became a vocal critic of the chemical industry, which he believed was polluting the environment with toxic substances.</p>
    <p>Throughout his life, Commoner fought tirelessly for the environment and advocated for sustainable practices. He passed away in 2012, but his legacy lives on as a reminder that we must take action to prevent environmental pollution.</p>

    <h2>The Incurable Disease</h2>
    <p>Environmental pollution is like a disease that is slowly destroying our planet. It can take many forms - air pollution, water pollution, soil pollution, and more. The effects are widespread and devastating - from climate change and ocean acidification to health problems and biodiversity loss.</p>
    <p>The sad truth is that once pollution has occurred, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to reverse the damage. This is why prevention is crucial. We must take action to reduce pollution and protect our environment before it's too late.</p>
