  <p>Imagine being asked to serve as the Secretary of State under a new president, someone you had never met before. This was the situation that Dean Acheson found himself in when Harry Truman was sworn in as the 33rd President of the United States in 1945.</p>
  <p>As Acheson sat down with Truman for the first time, he could tell that the president was skeptical of him. Truman had not been involved in the selection process for the Cabinet and was unsure about what to expect from Acheson. But instead of being defensive or trying to assert his authority, Acheson listened carefully to Truman's concerns and questions.</p>
  <p>Over the next few weeks, Acheson worked tirelessly to build a relationship with Truman. He made an effort to understand the president's priorities and concerns, and he went out of his way to keep Truman informed about the State Department's activities. Acheson soon earned Truman's respect and trust, and he went on to serve as Secretary of State for more than five years.</p>
  <p>This story is a powerful example of the importance of understanding who is president when serving as Secretary of State. In this article, we will explore why this understanding is so crucial, and we will offer some practical tips for those who find themselves in this position.</p>
  <h2>Why Understanding Who Is President Matters</h2>
  <p>There are several reasons why it is essential for the Secretary of State to understand who is president:</p>

   <li>The president is the ultimate decision-maker. While the Secretary of State has a great deal of influence over foreign policy, the president has the final say. If you don't understand the president's thinking, you may find yourself at odds with his decisions.</li>
   <li>The president is the face of American diplomacy. When you represent the United States abroad as Secretary of State, you are representing the president as well. To be an effective diplomat, you need to be able to convey the president's message clearly and convincingly.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Dean Acheson understood these dynamics well, and he worked hard to build a strong relationship with Truman based on mutual respect and trust.</p>
