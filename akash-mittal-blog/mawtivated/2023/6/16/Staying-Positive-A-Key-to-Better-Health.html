  <p>Here are some practical tips for staying positive and focused on good health:</p><!-- examples -->

   <li><strong>Visualize your goals:</strong> Whether it's running a marathon, losing weight, or just feeling more energetic, visualization can be a powerful tool for staying motivated and focused. Take some time each day to imagine yourself succeeding at your goals, and let that vision guide your actions.</li>
   <li><strong>Surround yourself with support:</strong> Whether it's family, friends, a therapist, or a support group, having people who believe in you and your ability to heal can make all the difference. Reach out to others and let them know what you're going through, and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it.</li>
   <li><strong>Stay mindful:</strong> Mindfulness is all about being present in the moment and letting go of worries about the past or future. By staying focused on the here and now, you can reduce stress and anxiety and improve your overall quality of life. Try practicing yoga, meditation, or breathing exercises to help you stay mindful and centred.</li>
