    <h3>The Beginning</h3>
    <p>Once upon a time, there was a young boy named David who lived in a remote village. He was known for his honesty and integrity in the community. Everyone trusted him and always turned to him for advice. David's father once told him, "Son, always remember that truth is like a rock, it may be hard to break but it will never fail you."</p>
    <p>David took his father's words to heart and made it his life's mission to always speak the truth, no matter how difficult it may seem. He faced many challenges along the way but he never wavered in his commitment to the truth.</p>

    <h3>Author - Oliver Wendell Holmes</h3>
    <p>Oliver Wendell Holmes was an American jurist and a member of the Supreme Court in the late 1800s. He was known for his famous quote, "Truth is tough. It will not break, like a bubble, at a touch nay, you may kick it about all day like a football, and it will be round and full at evening." This quote has stood the test of time and has become a powerful reminder of the importance of truth in our lives.</p>
    <p>Holmes' belief in the toughness of truth was rooted in his own experiences as a judge and as a member of the legal community. He knew that truth could be elusive at times, but he also knew that it was essential for justice to prevail.</p>

    <h3>The Importance of Truth</h3>
    <p>The importance of truth cannot be overstated. It is the foundation of trust, integrity and respect. Without truth, our society would be in chaos and our relationships would be meaningless. When we speak the truth, we build bridges of trust and understanding between ourselves and others.</p>
    <h4>Examples</h4>
    <ul>
     <li>A child who admits to breaking a vase is more likely to be forgiven than one who denies it.</li>
     <li>An employee who tells the truth about a mistake is more likely to be supported and helped than one who tries to cover it up.</li>
     <li>A politician who speaks the truth about a difficult issue is more likely to be respected than one who avoids it or tells falsehoods.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Personal Anecdote</h4>
    <p>I remember a time when I made a mistake at work and tried to cover it up. I thought I could fix it without anyone knowing, but it only made things worse. My boss found out and I was reprimanded. It wasn't until I admitted my mistake and apologized that I earned back the trust of my colleagues and was able to move forward.</p>
