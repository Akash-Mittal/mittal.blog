    <h3>The Power of Self-Reflection</h3>
    <p>When I was in high school, I used to be an overconfident kid who thought he was invincible. I used to skip classes, disobey rules, and break hearts without a second thought. I thought I knew everything and that I was unstoppable. Until one day, I got into a car accident that changed my life forever. I lost my best friend, my car, and my freedom. It was a wake-up call that I will never forget.</p>
    <blockquote>
     "I like to think of my behavior in the sixties as a 'learning experience.' Then again, I like to think of anything stupid I've done as a 'learning experience.' It makes me feel less stupid." <br>
      â€”P. J. O'Rourke
    </blockquote>
    <p>It took me years to recover from that trauma and to realize that I was not as smart or as invincible as I thought. It took me even longer to learn from my mistakes and to become a better person. But the journey was worth it. I learned the art of self-reflection, which helped me to become more humble, more compassionate, and more resilient.</p>
