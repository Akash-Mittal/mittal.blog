    <h2>The Journey of Love and Marriage</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time, a boy and a girl met in high school. They fell in love and started dating. They did everything together, and their love grew stronger every day. As they neared graduation, they knew they wanted to spend the rest of their lives together. They got married and lived happily ever after.</p>
    <p>Or did they?</p>
    <p>As Bette Davis once said, "Brought up to respect the conventions, love had to end in marriage. I'm afraid it did." This quote speaks to the conventional wisdom that love and marriage are synonymous, that the natural progression of a romantic relationship is to culminate in marriage. But is that always the case?</p>
    <p>To be clear, there is nothing inherently wrong with marriage. It can be a beautiful thing, a symbol of commitment and love. But it is not the only way to express love, and it is not the goal of every romantic relationship. Yet, our society often treats it as such.</p>
    <p>Many young people grow up with the idea that finding a romantic partner is the ultimate goal, and that everything should be done with the intention of achieving that goal. This can be seen in the way we socialize, with dating being a common pastime among young people. The focus on finding a partner can also be seen in the media, with countless movies and TV shows depicting romantic relationships as the ultimate goal for the protagonists.</p>

    <h2>The Pressure of Convention</h2>
    <p>When we are brought up with the convention that love must end in marriage, it can create a lot of pressure to conform. We may feel like we are not living up to expectations if we do not pursue marriage as a goal. This pressure can be especially strong for women, who are often socialized to see marriage as the ultimate achievement.</p>
    <p>But this pressure can be damaging. It can lead us to enter into relationships or marriages that we are not truly happy in, simply because we feel like we are supposed to. It can also lead us to overlook other important aspects of our lives in pursuit of this goal, such as our career or personal goals.</p>
    <p>It is important to remember that love does not have to end in marriage. We can love someone deeply without ever getting married, and that love can be just as fulfilling as a marriage. It is also important to remember that marriage is not the only way to show commitment to someone. We can show commitment in a variety of ways, such as being there for them through tough times or working together towards common goals.</p>

    <h2>Breaking Convention</h2>
    <p>Breaking convention can be scary, but it can also be incredibly liberating. When we stop focusing on marriage as the end goal, we open ourselves up to new possibilities and experiences.</p>
    <p>One way to break convention is to focus on our own personal growth and development. Instead of obsessing over finding a romantic partner, we can focus on our career goals or hobbies. By doing so, we become more fulfilled as individuals, which in turn helps us attract healthier, happier relationships.</p>
    <ul>
     <li>We can also challenge traditional gender roles. Instead of seeing marriage as a way to fulfill our assigned roles as women or men, we can work towards a more equitable society where everyone is free to pursue their unique talents and passions.</li>
     <li>We can also embrace non-traditional relationship structures, such as polyamory or open relationships. These relationships can be just as fulfilling and committed as traditional monogamous relationships, while allowing for more freedom and exploration.</li>
     <li>We can also choose to forego marriage altogether. While this may not be the right choice for everyone, it can be a freeing decision for those who feel like marriage is not for them.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The most important thing is to remember that we have a choice. We do not have to conform to traditional ideas about love and marriage. We can choose to create our own paths, based on our own desires and needs.</p>
