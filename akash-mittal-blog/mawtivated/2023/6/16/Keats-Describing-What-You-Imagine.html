   <p>Have you ever heard the story of John Keats? Born in London in 1795, Keats lost both of his parents before he turned 14. Despite his hardships, he was a passionate writer and wrote beautiful poetry. He became one of England's greatest poets, but unfortunately, his work was only recognized after he had passed away at the young age of 25.</p>
   <p>Keats once said, "You speak of Lord Byron and me, there is this great difference between us. He describes what he sees, I describe what I imagine. Mine is the hardest task." Keats believed that imagining something and then putting it into words was much more challenging than simply writing about what you see. This perspective is something that all writers can apply to their craft.</p>
   <h2>Examples of "Describing What You Imagine"</h2>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>Creating a Scene:</strong> When writing a story, describing the scene your characters are in is crucial. Instead of just stating the facts (ex. the room had a window and a table), use your imagination to create a sensory experience for the reader (ex. the sun streamed in through the window, casting a golden glow on the dusty table).</li>
    <li><strong>Emotions and Feelings:</strong> Imagination is key when describing emotions or feelings. Saying that a character was "happy" or "angry" is not enough. Use your imagination to describe how that happiness or anger manifests in the character's body, thoughts or actions (ex. her heart swelled with joy, his fists clenched with anger).</li>
    <li><strong>Action Sequences:</strong> When you're describing an action sequence, you need to be imaginative to keep it interesting. Use vivid words and sensory details to help the reader envision the scene in their mind's eye (ex. the bolts of lightning lit up the sky as the hero's sword flashed through the air, striking the dragon's scaly skin).</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>Practical Tips for "Describing What You Imagine"</h2>
   <ul>
    <li><em>Use Sensory Details:</em> Ask yourself what you see, hear, feel, smell or taste and try to incorporate those details into your writing.</li>
    <li><em>Show, don't tell:</em> Instead of just telling the reader something, try to show them through your characters' actions or reactions.</li>
    <li><em>Practice Visualization:</em> Visualize the scene in your mind before you start writing and then try to translate what you see into words.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, John Keats was a brilliant writer who believed that describing what you imagine is the hardest task. However, with practice and following some practical tips, any writer can improve their ability to describe what they imagine. Remember to use sensory details, show instead of telling, and practice visualization.</p>
