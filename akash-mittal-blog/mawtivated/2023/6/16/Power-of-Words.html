   <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
   <p>When I was young, my father used to tell me a story about a girl who used to live in our neighbourhood. She was always bullied by her classmates because she had a stutter. One day, she heard a speech by a famous poet, Muhammad Iqbal. In that speech, he said:</p>
   <blockquote>
    Words, without power, is mere philosophy.
   </blockquote>
   <p>Those words struck a chord with the girl and gave her hope. She began to read books and practice speaking. Slowly but surely, she improved her speech and gained confidence. Eventually, she stood up to her bullies and became a successful public speaker and writer. This girl's story taught me the power of words and how they can transform lives.</p>

   <p>When I was in college, I struggled with public speaking. I would get nervous and stumble over my words. However, I found that by reading and studying great speeches, I was able to improve my own speaking skills. I practiced and rehearsed until I felt confident enough to give a powerful speech in front of my class. Since then, I have continued to use the power of words to motivate and inspire others.</p>
