  <h1>Don't Let Age Limit You</h1></br> <img src="images/You-are-Never-too-Old-to-Set-a-New-Goal-or-Dream-a-New-Dream.jpeg" alt="+You-are-Never-too-Old-to-Set-a-New-Goal-or-Dream-a-New-Dream+"></br>
  <p>There was an elderly man who used to cycle to the local park in his small town every morning. He would sit on a bench, feed the pigeons, and watch the children running around, playing games and laughing joyously. One day, a group of teenagers approached him and asked why he sat there and did nothing when he was healthy enough to join the fun. The old man simply replied:</p>
  <blockquote>
   "I may be old, but that doesn't mean I have to stop dreaming. I may not be able to play with you all, but I still have a goal to achieve."
  </blockquote>
  <p>The teenagers were left stunned and embarrassed, however, it's the old man's words that struck a chord with everyone around him. The truth is, it's never too late to set a new goal or to dream a new dream. You may feel like you are too old to take on a new challenge, but age shouldn't limit you from pursuing what you truly desire.</p>
  <h2>Author C.S. Lewis</h2>
  <p>C.S. Lewis was an author, philosopher, and theologian, famous for his works like Chronicles of Narnia, Mere Christianity, and The Screwtape Letters. Despite being a literature professor for over 30 years, he didn't start writing his novels until he was in his 50s. His iconic book series, The Chronicles of Narnia, took him a decade to complete, yet they remain one of the most beloved children's books of all time.</p>
  <p>Many people are unaware of the fact that Lewis' mother died when he was only 9, and his father sent him to boarding school, which he despised. It was his series of hardships that led him to dream of fantasy worlds and eventually create the magic of his novels. This taught us a significant lesson that no matter how old or young, you are never too late to pursue something that you're passionate about.</p>
  <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
  <p>There are many examples of people who have achieved great success later in life:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Colonel Sanders, the founder of KFC, started his career at the age of 62</li>
   <li>Oscar-winning actress Judi Dench was in her 60s when she appeared in her first James Bond movie</li>
   <li>English novelist Mary Wesley's first novel wasn't published until she was 71 years old</li>
   <li>Fauja Singh, a British Sikh marathon runner, ran his first marathon at the age of 89, and his last one at 102</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These people stand as a testimony to the fact that age does not limit what one can achieve. It should never be an excuse to stop us from pursuing our dreams.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>It is essential to remember that age is just a number, and it should never hinder us from dreaming big or setting new goals. Here are three things you can do:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Identify your passion: Decide what you enthusiastically desire to do and pursue it with all your heart.</li>
   <li>Stay curious: Life offers us chances to learn and grow continuously. Always be curious and open to learning new things.</li>
   <li>Take Action: Motivation isn't always enough to achieve our dreams. Take every opportunity to work toward your goals and let every failure teach you a new lesson.</li>
  </ol>
