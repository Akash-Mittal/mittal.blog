   <h3>An Inspiring Story</h3>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>Many years ago, there was a boy named Alex who lived in a small village in a developing country. Alex was not like the other children in his village. He was curious and had this unsatisfied hunger for knowledge. It pained him to see young girls married off at young ages and not given the opportunity to be educated, or boys forced to work long hours in the fields, with no hope to ever go to school.</p>
   <p>One day, Alex met a woman who was volunteering in his village. She was surprised to find a young boy who was so interested in learning, and she took it upon herself to teach him basic reading and writing skills. Alex was overjoyed at this new capacity to understand the world around him and commited to achieve greater things. He worked hard to collect his books and papers while also contributing in his family's farm but secretly planned his escape to better fulfill his aspirational dreams.</p>
   <p>Through the efforts of the woman and Alex's own determination, he eventually went on to become the first person from his village to graduate from university. He came back to his village years later, with an aim to help the younger generation who might be experiencing the same difficulties he went through. He wanted to provide an opportunity for the children to explore the world around them, and ultimately, to enable the children to take control of the direction in which their lives were headed. This story is just one incredible example that highlights what we mean when we talk about the power of education.</p>
   <h2>Jerome Bruner: A Visionary Behind The Power of Education</h2>
   <p>Jerome Bruner, a psychologist and educator, knows all about the power of education. He believes that education is more than just a means of transmitting a set of cultural norms and values from one generation to the next. Education is about more than just ensuring that children learn the basics, it's about developing their sense of curiosity and wonder about the world around them</p>
   <p>Bruner is well known for his contribution to the field of cognitive psychology, especially his work on scaffolding in learning. In layman's terms, he believed that learning should not just be about acquiring knowledge but about developing skills and abilities, and ultimately being able to transfer these skills across different contexts. In essence, learning is a way to stimulate the intellect and make sense of the world around us.</p>
   <h2>The Importance of Alternative Views of the World</h2>
   <p>One of the key aspects of providing education is giving children access to a variety of perspectives and alternative ways of understanding the world. This includes developing an appreciation for different cultures and traditions, as well as the ability to think critically and evaluate different viewpoints. Education should empower students to deconstruct the dominant narratives, question what they know and be curious about the things they don't understand.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Schools Providing Alternative Views of World Through Education</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>The Freedom School, Harlem, USA: This school focuses on providing education to the children of low-income families and empowering them to become agents of change in their communities. They use a culturally relevant curriculum and teach the importance of activism and civic engagement.</li>
    <li>Casa Thomas Jefferson, Brazil: This bilingual school promotes cultural exchanges between Brazil and the United States and encourages students to learn about different aspects of American and Brazilian culture, such as music, art, and literature.</li>
    <li>United World Colleges, Various Countries: These schools bring together students from different countries and cultures and encourage them to develop their sense of global citizenship. They focus on values like community service, environmental stewardship and intercultural understanding.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>Education is a powerful tool that has the potential to transform lives. By not only transmitting culture but also providing alternative views of the world, we can help children develop the skills and attitudes they need to become engaged citizens of the world. We need to inspire the next generation to ask questions, be curious, and be active participants in their own learning. We cannot imagine what the world could look like if every child had the opportunity to become an agent of change in their own life and in their communities.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, we've established that education serves as a provider of alternative views of the world and that it is the duty of every society to provide access to education. In summary, here are three key points to take away:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Education should be about more than just transmitting culture. It should also focus on providing alternative perspectives of the world to encourage critical thinking and curiosity.</li>
    <li>Cultural exchange is a great way to promote alternative perspectives and increase the cultural awareness of students. Programs like the United World Colleges are perfect examples of this.</li>
    <li>Alternative perspectives are particularly important in low-income communities, as children often do not have access to the same opportunities as their more privileged counterparts. Schools like the Freedom School demonstrate how education can be a tool for empowerment and change.</li>
