    <p>Once upon a time in a small village, there was a young girl named Maria. She was known for her stunning beauty that could turn heads in any direction. However, Maria never took pride in her beauty or flaunted it for pleasure. She respected the gift she possessed and used it to spread kindness and love among people.</p>
    <p>As she grew up, she came across people who didn't understand the real purpose of beauty. They saw it as a tool to manipulate or lure someone into doing something. These people were driven by their own pleasure and didn't care about the consequences it brought upon others.</p>
    <p>This story is a perfect example of how beauty can be misused when it is sought not from religion and love but for pleasure. The quote by Annie Dillard, "As soon as beauty is sought not from religion and love, but for pleasure, it degrades the seeker," highlights the true essence of beauty and how it should be appreciated.</p>
    <h2>What is beauty?</h2>
    <p>Beauty is not just skin deep; it goes beyond that. It is a characteristic that is appreciated for its unique and admirable qualities. It is a quality that is appreciated by all because it is a universal language that transcends through cultures, time and space. Beauty is in everything, from nature to people to art to music.</p>
    <h2>Why should we respect beauty?</h2>

    <ul>

     <li><b>Pressure to conform:</b> Society has set a standard for beauty, and people who seek it for pleasure tend to conform to these standards. This can lead to low self-esteem and body image issues.</li>
     <li><b>Unhealthy competition:</b> People who seek beauty for pleasure tend to compete with each other, leading to an unhealthy and toxic environment. They often use extreme measures such as cosmetic surgery or unhealthy diets to achieve this goal.</li>
    </ul>
