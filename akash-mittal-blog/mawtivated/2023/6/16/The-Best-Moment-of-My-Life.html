    <h2>A Dream Come True</h2>
    <blockquote>
     <p>"I was in the bath at the time, and my dad came running in and said, 'Guess who they want to play Harry Potter!?' and I started to cry."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>These words are forever etched in the minds of Harry Potter fans, and for good reason. The story of how Daniel Radcliffe was selected to play the iconic wizard is nothing short of inspiring. At just eleven years old, Radcliffe was plucked from obscurity to star in what would become a record-breaking film franchise.</p>
    <p>For Radcliffe, it was a dream come true. As a young boy, he had always loved acting and had already appeared in several productions before the Harry Potter audition. But it was his portrayal of the bespectacled hero that would catapult him to global fame and forever change his life.</p>
    <h2>Becoming Harry Potter</h2>
    <p>For the next decade, Radcliffe would embody the character that millions had come to love. He grew up on set, alongside co-stars Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, and created a bond with them that has lasted to this day.</p>
    <p>But becoming Harry Potter was not without its challenges. The pressure of carrying such a beloved character on his shoulders was immense, and Radcliffe admits that it took a toll on his mental health. He struggled with alcoholism and found it difficult to adjust to life outside of the wizarding world.</p>
    <h2>Life After Harry Potter</h2>
    <p>Despite the challenges, Radcliffe has gone on to have a successful career beyond Harry Potter. He has starred in a range of productions, from stage plays to indie films to big-budget blockbusters. He has also become a vocal advocate for mental health, using his own struggles to help others.</p>
    <p>Radcliffe's story is a testament to the power of following your dreams, even when they seem impossible. It is a reminder that success often comes with its own set of challenges, and that it's okay to ask for help along the way.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

     <li>Success often comes with its own set of challenges, and it's important to take care of your mental health along the way.</li>
