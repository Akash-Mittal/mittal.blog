   <p>When I was at the peak of my music career, I often had to travel long distances to perform. One such trip was from my home in Tennessee to Los Angeles. As much as I loved music, the thought of driving for hours on end, through unfamiliar terrain, filled me with anxiety.</p>
   <p>Then, I met Peggy.</p>
   <p>Peggy was an acquaintance who shared my love for music. We decided to travel together for the LA trip. From then onwards, every long drive became an adventure filled with laughter, conversations, and the excitement of exploring new places together.</p>
   <h2>Why Company Matters</h2>
   <p>My experience with Peggy taught me an invaluable lesson - company matters. Having someone to travel with can make all the difference, especially when you are feeling anxious or uncertain about the journey ahead.</p>
   <p>Whether it is a long drive, a hike, or a visit to a new city, the company can provide support and companionship that can give you the courage and confidence to step out of your comfort zone.</p>
   
   <p>Over the years, I have met several people who have shared experiences similar to mine. A friend in Tennessee, who struggled with social anxiety, found that going out with her friend group helped her overcome her fears.</p>
   <p>Another acquaintance, who had a phobia of flying, found that booking a seat next to her friend made her flights more manageable. Before she knew it, she had overcome her fear and was even traveling solo to faraway places.</p>
   <h2>Examples</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Going on a solo hike can be daunting, but having a friend along can give you the confidence to go on a more difficult trail.</li>
    <li>Visiting an unfamiliar city can be overwhelming, but having a local friend show you around can make it a more comfortable and enjoyable experience.</li>
    <li>Attending a social event where you don't know anyone can be nerve-wracking, but going with a trusted friend can provide a sense of security and support.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, company can provide the much-needed support, courage, and confidence to tackle new experiences and overcome fears. Therefore, it is important to surround ourselves with friends and loved ones who can provide companionship and encouragement.</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Seek company when embarking on new experiences</li>
    <li>Surround yourself with friends and loved ones</li>
    <li>Encourage others to join you in your journey</li>
   </ol>
