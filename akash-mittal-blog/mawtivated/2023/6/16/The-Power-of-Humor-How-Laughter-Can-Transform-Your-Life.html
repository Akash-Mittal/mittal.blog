  <p>Have you ever wondered why laughter is considered the best medicine? Let me tell you a story about George Thorogood.</p>
  <p>George Thorogood, a blues rock musician, had a dream to become a famous artist. He worked tirelessly, playing gigs in small bars and clubs, but always struggled to gain recognition.</p>
  <p>One day, George received an invitation to play at the Montreux Jazz Festival. Excited about the opportunity, he quickly accepted the gig. However, when he arrived at the festival, he realized he had been placed on the "blues day" lineup, which meant he would be playing after some of the biggest names in the business, including Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker. His nerves began to take over, and he feared that no one would have any interest in seeing him perform.</p>
  <p>But what happened next surprised everyone. When George stepped onto the stage, he decided to take a risk and tell a few jokes. In doing so, he won over the crowd and had them laughing throughout his entire set. By the time he finished, the audience was on their feet, clapping and cheering. That performance was a turning point in George's career. He went on to become a successful rock artist, known for his humorous and energetic performances.</p>
