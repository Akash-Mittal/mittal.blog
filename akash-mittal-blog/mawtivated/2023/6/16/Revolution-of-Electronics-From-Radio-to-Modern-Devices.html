   <h2>Inspiration behind the Invention</h2>
   <p>In the year 1958, Jack Kilby, an electrical engineer, was struggling with the problem of how to make all the electronic components, such as transistors and resistors, work together on a single semiconductor material. He decided to take a break and take a walk outside. As he walked, he came upon a garden with a lattice of trees. Suddenly, he got the idea of using a similar arrangement of trees to create a circuit on a single piece of semiconductor material. This spark of inspiration led to the invention of the integrated circuit (IC), which revolutionized the field of electronics.</p>

   <h2>Jack Kilby: The Mastermind behind IC</h2>
   <p>Jack Kilby was an American electrical engineer who had a great influence on the development of modern technology. He was born in 1923 in Jefferson City, Missouri, and was a brilliant student from an early age. Kilby graduated from the University of Illinois with a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Electrical Engineering.</p>
   <p>Kilby started working for Texas Instruments in 1958, where he invented the first integrated circuit, which is now commonly known as the microchip. The microchip is a small piece of semiconductor material that contains millions of transistors, resistors, and capacitors, all fabricated on a single chip of silicon. This invention led to the development of the modern computers, calculators, and other electronic devices that we use today.</p>
   <h2>Electronics: Then and Now</h2>
   <p>At the time Jack Kilby invented the integrated circuit, electronics was mostly radio and television, and the first computers. However, with the invention of the IC, electronics started to become more sophisticated. Today, we have smartphones, tablets, and other high-tech gadgets that are all based on the principles of the integrated circuit. In fact, the IC has become so ubiquitous that it's hard to imagine a world without it.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>In the past, electronics was mostly limited to radio and television.</li>
    <li>With the invention of IC, electronics became more sophisticated.</li>
    <li>Today, IC is the basis for modern devices that we use every day.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Evolution of Electronics</h2>
   <p>Electronics has come a long way since the days of radio and television. Today, we have devices that are capable of performing complex tasks, such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and machine learning. These devices have become an integral part of our lives, and they are changing the way we live and work.</p>
   <p>For instance, smartphones have become an essential tool for communication and entertainment. We now have access to the internet, social media, and online shopping at our fingertips. Similarly, wearable devices such as smartwatches have become popular, and they can be used to track our fitness, monitor our heart rate, and even make phone calls.</p>
