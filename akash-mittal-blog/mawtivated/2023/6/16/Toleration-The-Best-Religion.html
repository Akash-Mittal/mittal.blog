  <p>It was a warm day in the summer when Victor Hugo was walking down the street and noticed a small boy trying to sell flowers. The boy was obviously poor, and his clothes were tattered, but he smiled at Victor as he passed.</p>
  <p>Victor turned back and asked the boy why he was selling flowers. The boy replied that he wanted to help his family. Victor was moved by the boy's determination and gave him a generous sum of money and offered him a job.</p>
