    <h2>An Inspiring Story to Start With</h2>
    <p>There was once a man who saved an old lady from a burning building. He courageously rushed in and carried her to safety. However, when he was interviewed by the press, he humbly said, "It was just the right thing to do. Any decent human being would have done the same."</p>
    <p>This man may have shown great courage, but he also showed great courtesy by being humble and gracious. And that, my friends, is what separates a true gentleman from just any regular person.</p>

    <h2>Theodore Roosevelt: A True Gentleman</h2>
    <blockquote>
     "Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far."
    </blockquote>
    <p>These words from Theodore Roosevelt were not just a strategy in politics, but they were also a reflection of his character. He was known to be a gentleman, always using his words carefully and treating others with respect.</p>
    <p>He was also an example of a man who had both courage and courtesy. Not only was he a war hero, but he was also a conservationist who stood up for what he believed in and fought for the greater good.</p>

    <h2> and Examples</h2>
    <h3>Anecdote 1: The Elevator</h3>
    <p>I was once in an elevator with a group of people. When the doors opened, a woman with a stroller tried to enter, but the elevator was already too full. One man, however, stepped out and offered his spot to her. It was a small act of courtesy, but it made a big impression on everyone in the elevator.</p>
    <h3>Anecdote 2: The Restaurant</h3>
    <p>Another time, I was at a restaurant with some friends. The waiter accidentally spilled a drink on one of us, and it was obvious that he was mortified. Instead of getting upset, my friend calmly reassured him and even cracked a joke to make him feel better. It was a simple act of kindness, but it made a big impact on the waiter's day.</p>
    <p>These are just two small examples of how simple acts of courtesy can make a big difference in someone's day. It doesn't take a lot to be a gentleman, just a little bit of thoughtfulness and kindness towards others.</p>
