  </header>
  <main>
   <article>
    <p>Once upon a time, there was a young man named Theodore Sturgeon. He had a dream of pulling off a daring caper, but he soon realized that he didn't have the <strong>immoral courage</strong> to do it. Instead of giving up on his dream, he decided to write a story about it.</p>
    <p>Sturgeon was still a teenager at the time and didn't have any writing skills to speak of. But he didn't let that stop him. He put pen to paper and poured his heart out in 1500 words. The resulting story was not only cathartic for him but also became the foundation for his career as a writer.</p>
    <p>Sturgeon's story is a perfect example of how to shift from immoral courage to <strong>creative courage</strong>. Immoral courage is the kind of courage that leads us to take big risks for personal gain at the expense of others. Creative courage, on the other hand, is the kind of courage that leads us to take risks in pursuit of our passions and dreams.</p>
    <p>Sturgeon was able to turn his desire for a daring caper into a creative pursuit that not only fulfilled him but also inspired others. His story is a testament to the power of creative courage.</p>
