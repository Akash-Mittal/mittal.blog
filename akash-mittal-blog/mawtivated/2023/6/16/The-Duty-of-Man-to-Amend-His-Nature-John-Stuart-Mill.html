    <h2>John Stuart Mill's Background</h2>
    <blockquote>
     "The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant."
    </blockquote>
    <p>John Stuart Mill was born in 1806 in London, England. He was a philosopher, economist and political theorist who promoted the idea of individual freedom and the importance of personal development. In his book "On Liberty", Mill argued that society should not have the power to restrict individual freedom as long as it does not harm others.</p>
    <p>Mill believed that people should be free to pursue their own happiness and self-improvement. He argued that it is a duty of man to use reason and intelligence to make progress in our lives and the world around us. This includes the duty to amend our own nature and become better versions of ourselves.</p>
