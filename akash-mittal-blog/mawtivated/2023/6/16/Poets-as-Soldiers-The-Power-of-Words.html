  <p>Words are powerful. They have the ability to evoke emotions, inspire action, and change lives. And when it comes to poets, they are soldiers that liberate words from the steadfast possession of definition.</p>
  <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>

   <p>"Out of the night that covers me,<br>
     Black as the Pit from pole to pole,<br>
     I thank whatever gods may be<br>
     For my unconquerable soul."</p>
  </blockquote>
