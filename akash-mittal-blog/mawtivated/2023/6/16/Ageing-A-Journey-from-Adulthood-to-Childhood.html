    <p>Once upon a time, there was an old man named John. He spent most of his life working hard to provide for his family and making sure they had everything they needed. John was now in his seventies, but he still had the same childlike curiosity and joy that he had as a young boy. Despite the many challenges he faced in his life, John never lost his sense of wonder and optimism.</p>
    <p>As John grew older, he began to realize that the things that once seemed so important to him no longer mattered. He no longer cared about material possessions or the opinions of others. Instead, he found joy in the simple things in life, like spending time with his family, reading books, and taking long walks in nature.</p>
    <p>John had come full circle. He had started his life as a child, then became an adult, and now, in his old age, he had returned to his childlike state. And he was happier than ever.</p>

    <h3>The Journey of Ageing</h3>
    <p>As Sophocles said, "A man growing old becomes a child again." But why does this happen? Is it just a natural part of the ageing process, or is there something more to it?</p>
    <p>Ageing is a journey that starts from the moment we are born. We go through various stages of development, from infancy to childhood, adolescence to adulthood, and finally, old age. Each stage brings its own challenges and rewards.</p>
    <p>When we are young, we are full of energy and curiosity. We want to explore the world around us and learn as much as we can. As we grow older, we become more focused on achieving our goals and building our careers. We start to take on more responsibilities, such as marriage, children, and financial stability.</p>
    <p>But as we enter old age, our priorities start to shift once again. We begin to realize that the things we once thought were so important were just distractions from what really mattered. We start to appreciate the simple pleasures in life, like spending time with our loved ones and enjoying the beauty of nature.</p>
    <p>This is why many people say that old age is like a second childhood. We become more carefree and curious, just like we were when we were young. We let go of our fears and insecurities and embrace the world with open arms. We become more childlike, but in a good way.</p>
