   <h2>An inspiring story</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>It was during the 1970 elections when a candidate by the name of Abraham, who was running for a political office in a remote village in Africa, stumbled upon a group of hungry children devouring leftover food from trash cans. Abraham was moved by the sight and took immediate action. He provided food to the hungry children, and this gesture created a ripple effect that eventually earned him a considerable amount of support from the community.</p>
   <p>This heartwarming story is a testimony to the truth behind the quote, "An empty stomach is not a good political adviser." People who are hungry may not have the ability to think rationally or make informed decisions. Consequently, a candidate who prioritizes the basic needs of the electorate often wins their hearts and mind.</p>
   <p>The quote was coined by Albert Einstein, a brilliant physicist and Nobel Laureate who also had a keen interest in social and political issues. Einstein's immense intellect and profound knowledge of human behavior led him to draw insightful conclusions, one of which is the role of hunger in shaping political decisions.</p>
   <h3>Why Hunger Affects Political Decisions?</h3>
   <p>People who are hungry are focused on their immediate needs, such as food, shelter, and safety. They may lack energy, concentration, and interest in other issues. Therefore, when it comes to making political decisions, they are more likely to favor leaders who promise to fulfill their basic needs over those who make grand speeches about abstract ideas or complex policies.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, hungry people are often vulnerable to manipulation and exploitation. Unscrupulous politicians may offer them food or other incentives in exchange for their votes. This practice, known as vote-buying, is illegal and undermines the integrity of the democratic process. However, it remains prevalent in many parts of the world, especially in developing countries where poverty and hunger are widespread.</p>
   <h3>Examples of How Hunger Influences Politics</h3>
   <p>India is one of the countries where hunger is a significant political issue. According to a 2019 report by the Global Hunger Index, India ranks 102 out of 117 countries in terms of hunger and malnutrition. The report states that around 14% of India's population is undernourished.</p>
   <p>As a result, political parties in India have recognized the importance of addressing hunger in their election campaigns. In the 2019 general elections, the main opposition party, Congress, promised to provide a minimum income guarantee to poor families, while the ruling party, BJP, pledged to provide free cooking gas connections, electricity, and toilets to rural households.</p>
   <p>In another example, Venezuela, a country that has been plagued by political and economic crises, hunger has become a weapon in the hands of the government. The government distributes food and other basic necessities to its supporters through a program called CLAP, which stands for Local Committees for Supply and Production. However, the program has been criticized for corruption, inefficiency, and favoritism. Critics claim that the government uses food as a means of controlling the population and punishing its opponents.</p>
   <h3>Conclusion</h3>
   <p>Albert Einstein's quote, "An empty stomach is not a good political adviser," highlights the fact that hunger and poverty have a significant impact on political decisions. Candidates who address the basic needs of the electorate are more likely to gain their trust and support. However, a society where people go hungry cannot be considered truly democratic or just. Therefore, it is essential to address hunger and poverty not only from a political perspective but also from a moral and humanitarian perspective.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Addressing hunger is essential for a healthy democracy.</li>
    <li>Politicians must prioritize the basic needs of the electorate.</li>
    <li>Hunger and poverty are not only political but also moral issues that require urgent action.</li>
   </ul>
