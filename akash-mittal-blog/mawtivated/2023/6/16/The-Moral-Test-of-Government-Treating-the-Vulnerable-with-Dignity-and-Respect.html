   <p>When we think of good governance, we often think of efficiency, transparency, and accountability. But those qualities alone do not make a government great. A truly great government is one that prioritizes the well-being of its most vulnerable members: children, elderly, sick, needy, and handicapped.</p>
   <p>The Beatitudes in the Bible were given to us by Jesus Christ himself, whose words give us guidance on showing compassion towards others. "Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy," (Matthew 5:7) tells us that by showing kindness and mercy to others, we will be blessed in return. The story of Hubert H. Humphrey, the author of the quote "the moral test of government," perfectly illustrates the importance of treating the vulnerable with dignity and respect.</p>
   <h2>The Inspiring Story of Hubert H. Humphrey</h2>
   <p>Hubert H. Humphrey was an American politician who served as the 38th Vice President of the United States from 1965 to 1969. Before that, he had a long career as a United States Senator from Minnesota. Throughout his career, Humphrey was known for being an advocate for civil rights, as well as for his work on healthcare issues. Humphrey was diagnosed with bladder cancer in 1977 and died in 1978. In his memory, the Hubert H. Humphrey Cancer Center was built in Minnesota, serving as a reminder of the importance of fighting cancer, even in death.</p>
   <p>The career of Hubert H. Humphrey is an excellent example of a politician who prioritized the needs of the vulnerable when it mattered most. For Humphrey, civil rights and healthcare were the two issues he was most passionate about. He believed that everyone deserved to be treated with dignity and respect, no matter what their race or socioeconomic background was. He knew what it was like to be marginalized, and he used his position of power to help those who were most in need.</p>
   <h2>Why the Moral Test of Government is Important</h2>
   <p>Good governance means different things to different people, but there are a few qualities that most people would agree are essential. These include transparency, accountability, and efficiency. However, we cannot forget that the ultimate goal of good governance is to improve the lives of people. Therefore, good governance must prioritize the well-being of the most vulnerable members of society. Failure to do so will lead to a breakdown of society, as those who are most in need are left behind.</p>
   <p>Children, elderly, sick, needy, and handicapped members of society are often the most vulnerable. They are the ones who are most in need of help, and yet they are also the ones who are most likely to be ignored. A government that prioritizes the well-being of these groups is one that truly cares about the people it serves.</p>
   <p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), healthcare is a fundamental human right. A government that fails to provide adequate healthcare to its citizens is one that is failing its moral test. Similarly, a government that fails to provide education and social welfare support to the most vulnerable members of society is one that is failing its moral test.</p>

    <li>Treating the vulnerable with dignity and respect is the moral test of government.</li>
    <li>The well-being of the most vulnerable members of society must be a priority for any good government.</li>
