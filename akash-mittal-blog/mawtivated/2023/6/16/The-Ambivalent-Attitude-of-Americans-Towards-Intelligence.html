   <p>Intelligence, as defined by Merriam-Webster dictionary, is the ability to learn or understand things or to deal with new or difficult situations. It has been considered as one of the most essential ingredients in the success of an individual or a nation. But why do Americans have an ambivalent attitude towards it?</p>
   <h2>Author's Background: Vernon A. Walters</h2>
   <p>Vernon A. Walters, an American soldier and diplomat, was considered as one of the most intelligent officers in the U.S. Army during World War II and the Cold War. He had an extraordinary ability to speak several foreign languages fluently and served as an interpreter for several presidents and diplomats.</p>
   <h2>The Ambivalent Attitude of Americans</h2>
   <p>The quotation mentioned at the beginning of this article highlights the ambivalent attitude of Americans towards intelligence. When Americans feel threatened, they want a lot of it, and when they don't, they regard the whole thing as somewhat immoral. This peculiar attitude can be traced back to American culture, where individuals are expected to be independent and self-reliant. The idea of depending on intelligence or other people's knowledge is considered as a weakness.</p>
   <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
   <p>Take, for example, the story of John and Jane, two high school students who wanted to pursue a career in science. John was ridiculed by his peers for being too intelligent and reading science books all the time. Jane, on the other hand, was considered as a typical girl who only cared about her looks and fashion. It was only when Jane won a science fair competition that her intelligence was celebrated by her peers. John, unfortunately, was still being ridiculed.</p>
   <p>This kind of attitude towards intelligence does not only happen in high school. Even in the workplace, individuals who are considered as too intelligent are often resented and their ideas are ignored. This situation can result in a lack of diversity and creativity in the workplace and can ultimately lead to a decline in productivity.</p>
   <h2>Examples of the Importance of Intelligence</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Japan, a nation with a population of only 100 million, has one of the world's most advanced economies. This is due to the country's emphasis on education and intelligence.</li>
    <li>Elon Musk, one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the world, is known for his intelligence and innovative ideas. He was able to launch SpaceX and Tesla, two revolutionary companies that helped shape the future of transportation and space exploration.</li>
    <li>During the Cold War, intelligence played a vital role in winning the conflict without resorting to nuclear war. Vernon A. Walters, the American diplomat mentioned earlier, played a crucial role in negotiating with Soviet leaders and preventing a global conflict.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Intelligence is a powerful tool that can be harnessed for the benefit of individuals and society as a whole.</li>
    <li>The ambivalent attitude of Americans towards intelligence can result in missed opportunities and a lack of diversity and creativity in several fields.</li>
    <li>It is essential to embrace and celebrate intelligence as a valuable asset rather than regarding it as a weakness or an immoral act.</li>
   </ol>
