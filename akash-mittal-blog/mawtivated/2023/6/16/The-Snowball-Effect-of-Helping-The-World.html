   <p>Have you ever watched a snowball grow as it is rolled down a hill? At first, it's small and seemingly insignificant. But as it rolls down, it gains momentum and becomes bigger and bigger. This is precisely the way I feel about my power to help the world as I get older. I am like a snowball - the further I am rolled the more I gain.</p><!--inspiring story-->
   <h2>A Personal Anecdote</h2>
   <p>As a young woman, I didn't understand the full extent of the impact that I could have on the world. Like many of my contemporaries, I was focused on my own life and my own ambitions. It wasn't until I began to get involved in social and political causes that I realized just how powerful one person can be.</p>
   <p>I remember a particular incident that crystallized this idea for me. I was attending a rally for women's suffrage, and I noticed that one of the speakers had forgotten her notes. She was flustered and seemed on the verge of giving up. But I felt compelled to help her. I quickly jotted down the major points of her speech on a piece of paper and handed them to her. She looked at me with gratitude and went on to deliver a powerful message that I will never forget.</p><!--Susan B. Anthony story or background-->
   <h2>A Role Model: Susan B. Anthony</h2>
   <p>Susan B. Anthony, a pioneering women's rights activist, understood the power of persistence and determination. She fought tirelessly for the right to vote for women and, despite numerous setbacks, never gave up. When she died in 1906, women still did not have the right to vote, but she paved the way for future generations of women to fight for their rights.</p>
