    <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
    <p>During World War II, the American economy was struggling with high unemployment rates and a massive national debt. However, President Franklin D. Roosevelt refused to let these obstacles deter him from fighting for his country. Through determination, innovation, and strategic planning, Roosevelt led the country to victory while laying the foundation for long-term economic growth. One of his greatest insights was the devastating impact of war on national deficits. Roosevelt discovered that over ninety percent of all national deficits from 1921 to 1939 were caused by payments for past, present, and future wars. This realization motivated him to find ways to reduce military spending and invest in domestic programs that would promote economic growth.</p>

    <h2>The Lessons from Franklin D. Roosevelt</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>Reduce military spending and invest in domestic programs: Roosevelt understood that investing in programs that promote economic growth, such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure, is critical to long-term economic success.</li>
     <li>Be mindful of the debt: Roosevelt recognized that debt can be a significant burden on the economy, and he worked to keep both the national debt and the individual debt of his citizens manageable.</li>
