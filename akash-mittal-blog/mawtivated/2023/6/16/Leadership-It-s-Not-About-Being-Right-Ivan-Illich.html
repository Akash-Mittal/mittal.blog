  <h1>Leadership: It's Not About Being Right</h1></br> <img src="images/Leadership-It-s-Not-About-Being-Right-Ivan-Illich.jpeg" alt="+Leadership-It-s-Not-About-Being-Right-Ivan-Illich+"></br>
  <p>Leadership is a quality that can bring about change, inspire a team, and lead to success in various domains of life. However, many people misunderstand what leadership is all about. It's not about being right, but about guiding others towards a common goal. This article aims to explore the concept of leadership with the help of Ivan Illich's teachings and his inspiring story.</p>
  <h2>The Story of Ivan Illich</h2>
  <p>Ivan Illich was a philosopher, social critic, and historian who believed in the power of individual responsibility. Born in Austria in 1926, he grew up in Europe and later moved to the United States, where he taught at various universities. He was a thinker who believed in creating a world that emphasized human relationships over bureaucracy and technology. He wanted people to take control of their own lives and work together to bring about change.</p>
  <p>Ivan Illich's teachings on leadership emphasized on the fact that leadership is not about being right, but about bringing people together towards a common goal. He believed that a leader should be someone who guides and inspires others, rather than someone who simply holds power. In his eyes, a true leader is willing to listen, collaborate, and learn from others.</p>
  <h2>Why Leadership is Not About Being Right</h2>
  <p>Leadership is not about personal achievement, but about the success of the team. When a leader focuses only on personal goals, they may achieve success, but it is short-lived. The success of the team is more important as the team will work together to achieve fruitful results.</p>
  <p>When a leader is only concerned about personal achievements, ego takes over and they are not willing to learn from others. A true leader knows that knowledge is not limited to their own ideas, but comes from a team that includes different perspectives and skill sets.</p>
  <blockquote>
   "A leader is one who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way."
  </blockquote>
  <p>Leadership is not about being right, it is about gaining the trust of your team by creating a vision and working towards a common goal. A true leader must be willing to adapt and learn from others, no matter their position or background. They must be willing to serve their team, rather than mistreating their position of authority to demand service for themselves.</p>
  <h2>Practical Examples of Leadership</h2>
  <p>There are many examples of leaders who have shown that leadership is not about being right, but about guiding and inspiring a team towards success. One such leader was Steve Jobs of Apple. Jobs was a visionary who created a culture of innovation within his team. He was not always right, but he was willing to listen to new ideas and change his approach, which led to massive success for Apple.</p>
  <p>Another example of a great leader was Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi was committed to leading India to independence from British rule, and he accomplished this through nonviolent resistance. He was not focused on himself, but on the greater good of his people. Gandhi's leadership inspired millions of people and led to the creation of an independent India.</p>
