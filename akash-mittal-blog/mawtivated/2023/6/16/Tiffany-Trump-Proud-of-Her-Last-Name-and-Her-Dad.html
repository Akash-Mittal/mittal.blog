   <h2>An Inspiring Story to Salute the Youngest Trump Daughter</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>Being a Trump certainly commands attention. It comes with glamour, prestige, and power. But amidst all these impressive qualities and privileges, the youngest Trump daughter, Tiffany, is proud of one thing the most: her last name and her dad.</p>

    <h3>Marla Maples: A Mother's Tale</h3>
    <p>As a mother myself, I could relate to Marla Maples' story. Marla was a 23-year-old actress who met Donald Trump at a celebrity tennis tournament in 1989. At that time, Donald was already married to his first wife, Ivana. Despite that, he pursued Marla, and they started dating secretly.</p>
    <p>Marla became pregnant with Tiffany in 1993, and after that, Donald and Ivana got divorced. Even after all the controversies, Marla did not regret her relationship and shared her story on a podcast. "There were some definite challenges, but I loved Tiffany, and I was excited that she was coming into the world," she said.</p>
