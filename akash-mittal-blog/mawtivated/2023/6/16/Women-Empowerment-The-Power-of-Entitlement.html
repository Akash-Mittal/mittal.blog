   <!-- Continue the article with personal anecdotes and case studies -->
   <p>As Linda started her bulletin, she noticed that the male anchor was getting more airtime than her. She decided to speak up during the break, but the male producers dismissed her concerns. It then hit her that she was being treated unfairly because of her gender.</p>
   <p>However, Linda did not let this incident bring her down. Instead, she used the experience to fuel her passion for women empowerment. She realized that women need to feel entitled to positions of authority, just like men do. That realization led her to a lifetime commitment to empowering women.</p>
   <p>According to Linda, women's entitlement is not a negative trait, but a necessary one. It is the drive that leads women to believe that they have a natural place in leadership, just as men do. This sense of entitlement gives women the mental and emotional confidence to lead and make a positive impact in the world.</p><!-- Use bullet points and quotes for emphasis when necessary -->
