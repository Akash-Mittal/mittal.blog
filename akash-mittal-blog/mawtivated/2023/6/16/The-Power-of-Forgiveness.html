   <p>Have you ever felt hurt by someone that you loved and respected? Have you ever felt that you could never forgive them for what they did? I know I have. But today, I want to tell you a story about the power of forgiveness that completely changed my outlook on life.</p>
   <p>About five years ago, I was going through a difficult time in my life. My partner had recently left me and I was struggling with depression. It was during this time that I met Sister Mary, a nun whom I had been corresponding with about forgiveness.</p>
   <p>Sister Mary and I had been exchanging letters for a few months when I received an invitation to visit her at her convent. I was hesitant at first, but something inside me told me that I had to go.</p>
   <p>During my visit, Sister Mary told me a story about Julian Clary, a British comedian who had suffered a great loss. Julian had lost his partner to AIDS and was struggling to come to terms with his grief and anger. But then one day, Julian decided to forgive the man who had infected his partner with the virus. He realized that holding onto his anger and resentment was only hurting himself and preventing him from moving on.</p>
   <blockquote>
    "Forgiveness is not about forgetting. It's about letting go of the anger and resentment that's holding you back so that you can move forward with your life."
   </blockquote>
   <p>Those words stayed with me long after I left the convent. I realized that forgiveness wasn't about condoning the hurtful actions of others, but about freeing yourself from the pain and anger that those actions caused.</p>
   <p>Since then, I've been working on forgiving those who have hurt me in the past. It hasn't been easy, but I've learned that holding onto anger and resentment only hurts me in the long run. Here are some practical tips that have helped me along the way:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><span class="bold">Acknowledge your feelings:</span> It's okay to feel angry and hurt. Acknowledge those feelings and allow yourself to experience them.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Choose to forgive:</span> Forgiveness is a choice. Choose to forgive the person who has hurt you, even if you don't feel like it.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Let go of anger and resentment:</span> Holding onto anger and resentment only hurts you. Let go of those feelings and focus on moving forward.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Practice empathy:</span> Try to see things from the other person's perspective. This can help you understand their motivations and help you to forgive them.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Take care of yourself:</span> Forgiveness can be emotionally draining. Make sure to take care of yourself and seek support from friends and family.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>In conclusion, forgiveness is a powerful tool that can help us overcome even the most difficult of challenges. It's not about forgetting or condoning hurtful actions, but about freeing ourselves from the pain and anger that those actions caused. And remember, forgiveness is a choice that we can make every day.</p>
