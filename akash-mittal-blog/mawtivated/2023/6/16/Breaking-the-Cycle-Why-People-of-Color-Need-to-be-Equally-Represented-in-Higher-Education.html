  <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
  <p>The story of Mariah, a young woman from a low-income, predominantly African American community, is not unique. She grew up in a neighborhood where the streets were lined with liquor stores and the only viable job options were minimum wage positions. However, Mariah refused to let her circumstances define her. She knew that education was her ticket out of poverty and was determined to succeed.</p>
  <p>With the help of dedicated mentors and scholarships, Mariah was able to attend a prestigious university where she earned a degree in communication. Today, she is a successful public relations executive and serves as a role model for other young people in her community.</p>
  <h2>Author - Angela Davis Story or Background</h2>
  <p>Angela Davis is a renowned activist, author, and scholar who has dedicated her life to fighting for social justice. She was born in Birmingham, Alabama in 1944 and grew up in a neighborhood heavily affected by racial segregation. However, despite the obstacles she faced, Davis excelled in her studies and went on to earn a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Frankfurt in Germany.</p>
  <p>Throughout her career, Davis has been a vocal advocate for equal rights and opportunities for all people, regardless of race, gender, or socioeconomic status. She has written numerous books and articles on topics such as mass incarceration, feminism, and civil rights.</p>
  <h2>Why Representation Matters</h2>
  <p>The story of Mariah and the life work of Angela Davis both demonstrate the importance of equitable representation in higher education. Unfortunately, the reality is that poor people and people of color are much more likely to be found in prison than in institutions of higher education.</p>
  <p>In the United States, African American and Hispanic/Latino people are overrepresented in the criminal justice system. According to the Sentencing Project, while they make up just 30% of the general population, they account for 56% of those incarcerated. This systemic discrimination extends to education as well. As of 2019, the high school graduation rate for African American students was just 75%, compared to 88% for white students.</p>
  <p>There are many reasons for these disparities, including inadequate funding for public schools in low-income areas, racial biases in the criminal justice system, and institutional barriers to higher education such as legacy admissions and standardized testing.</p>
  <p>However, it is important to recognize that these inequalities are not just a matter of statistics. They have real and devastating consequences for individuals and communities. When young people are denied the opportunity to pursue their dreams and realize their potential, they are robbed of a bright future. When entire neighborhoods are oppressed and disadvantaged, society as a whole suffers.</p>
  <h2>The Power of Education</h2>
  <p>Education has the power to break down these barriers and create a more just society. By investing in education, we can empower people to realize their full potential and create a better future for themselves and their communities.</p>
  <p>Research has consistently shown that higher levels of education lead to higher incomes, lower rates of unemployment, and better health outcomes. In addition, educated individuals are more likely to be engaged citizens, participate in community organizations, and vote in elections.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, when people from diverse backgrounds are represented in higher education, it helps to break down stereotypes and promote understanding. This can lead to greater social cohesion and reduced discrimination.</p>
  <h2>Steps Toward Equity</h2>
  <p>So, what can we do to ensure that people of color are equally represented in higher education?</p>
  <ul class="bullet">
   <li>Provide adequate funding for public schools in low-income areas.</li>
   <li>Invest in programs that provide mentoring and academic support to young people from underrepresented communities.</li>
   <li>Eliminate institutional barriers to higher education, such as legacy admissions and standardized testing.</li>
   <li>Take steps to address racial biases in the criminal justice system.</li>
   <li>Support policies that promote diversity and inclusion on college campuses.</li>
   <li>Encourage and fund research on best practices for increasing access to higher education for people of color.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, we must recognize the importance of equitable representation in higher education. When we invest in education, we invest in the future of our society. By breaking down barriers to education, we can create a more just and equal world for all.</p>
