  <h1>The Galling Nature of Paternal Government</h1></br> <img src="images/The-Galling-Nature-of-Paternal-Government.jpeg" alt="+The-Galling-Nature-of-Paternal-Government+"></br>
  <p>Imagine being constantly told what to do, what to say, what to eat, what to drink and what to wear by a government that acts like a parent. Sounds frustrating, right? Thomas W. Higginson, an American abolitionist and women's rights advocate, once said, "Nothing is so galling to a people not broken in from birth as a paternal or in other words a meddling government." This statement is still applicable today, more than a century after he spoke those words.</p>
  <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
  <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, governments around the world imposed strict rules and regulations on their citizens. One of the most controversial measures was the mandatory wearing of face masks, which was implemented by many governments to reduce the spread of the virus.</p>
  <p>While most people complied with the mask mandate, there were a few who refused to wear masks, arguing that it infringed on their freedom. One such person was a woman named Amanda Eller, who lived in Hawaii. Eller was a yoga instructor and an avid hiker who loved to explore the island's trails. When the mask mandate was announced, Eller refused to wear a mask while hiking, insisting that it would interfere with her breathing and ruin her experience.</p>
  <p>Eller's refusal to wear a mask sparked a backlash, with many people criticizing her for being selfish and irresponsible. However, Eller stood her ground and refused to back down. She argued that the government had no right to tell her what to do with her body, and that it was up to her to decide whether or not to wear a mask.</p>
  <p>Eventually, Eller was arrested for violating the mask mandate. However, her case gained national attention and sparked a debate about the limits of governmental power. Many people criticized the government for being too controlling, while others argued that the mask mandate was necessary to protect public health.</p>
  <h2>Thomas W. Higginson's Background</h2>
  <p>Thomas Wentworth Higginson was born on December 22, 1823, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was an American Unitarian minister, author, abolitionist, and women's rights activist. Higginson was a prominent figure in the abolitionist movement and was a supporter of women's suffrage. He served as a colonel in the Union Army during the Civil War and was a close friend of Emily Dickinson, the famous poet.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Paternal Government</h2>
  <p>There are many examples of paternal governments around the world, some more extreme than others. Here are a few:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>In North Korea, the government controls all aspects of citizens' lives, including what they wear, what they read, and what they eat.</li>
   <li>In China, the government censors the internet and controls the media, limiting citizens' access to information.</li>
   <li>In Saudi Arabia, women are not allowed to drive or travel without a male guardian's permission.</li>
   <li>In Russia, the government suppresses political dissent and controls the media and the internet, limiting citizens' freedom of speech.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, a paternal government can be a frustrating and limiting experience for citizens. The government should act as a partner, not a parent, and provide its citizens with the tools and resources needed to make informed decisions.</p>
  <p>Here are three key takeaways to keep in mind:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>A paternal government can limit citizens' freedom and stifle creativity and innovation.</li>
   <li>The government should work with its citizens, not against them, to find solutions to problems and improve society.</li>
   <li>Citizens should speak up and advocate for their rights and freedoms, even in the face of government opposition.</li>
  </ol>
