    <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Sarah who dreamed of going to college. Her parents worked hard to save up enough money to pay for her education, but it wasn't enough. Sarah was heartbroken.</p>
    <p>One day, a financial advisor at her high school told her about a "preferred lender" program offered by the college she wanted to attend. Sarah was hesitant at first, but the advisor explained how it worked and why they trusted this particular lender. She decided to apply and was approved.</p>
    <p>Thanks to the preferred lender program, Sarah was able to afford tuition, textbooks, and even living expenses. She graduated with honors and went on to have a successful career.</p>
    <p>For Sarah, the power of trust made all the difference.</p>

    <h2>Why Students Choose Preferred Lenders</h2>
    <p>Andrew Cuomo once said, "Ninety percent of the students take the 'preferred lender.' Why? Because that's the nature of the relationship. You trust the school. The school is in a position of authority."</p>
    <p>There are a few reasons why students may choose to go with a preferred lender:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>They trust the school's judgment and reputation</li>
     <li>They feel more comfortable working with a lender that has an established relationship with the school</li>
     <li>They believe that the preferred lender will offer them the best rate and terms</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While these reasons may sound logical, it's important for students to do their own research and shop around for the best deal. Just because a lender is "preferred" by their school doesn't mean it's the best choice for them.</p>

    <h2>Examples of Preferred Lender Programs</h2>
    <p>There are many different types of preferred lender programs, but here are a few examples:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Sallie Mae offers a program called "Smart Option Student Loan" that is often preferred by schools because of its low interest rates and flexible repayment options.</li>
     <li>Citizens Bank has a "CollegeSaver" program that allows families to start saving for college early and earn rewards for making regular contributions.</li>
     <li>Credit unions often have preferred lender programs that offer low rates and personalized service.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It's important for students to carefully consider all their options and read the fine print before choosing a lender.</p>

    <h2>Andrew Cuomo's Story</h2>
    <p>Andrew Cuomo, the former governor of New York, is famous for his investigations into the student loan industry. He discovered that many colleges had secret agreements with lenders, known as "preferred lender lists," that were not in the best interest of students.</p>
    <p>Cuomo worked to expose these unethical practices and fought for reforms that would protect students and their families from predatory lending. His efforts led to several high-profile settlements and changes in federal law.</p>
    <p>Today, students have more options and protections than ever before, thanks in part to Cuomo's advocacy work.</p>
