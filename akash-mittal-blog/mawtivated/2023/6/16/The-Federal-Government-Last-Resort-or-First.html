   <p>An inspiring story by Donald Rumsfeld</p>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>Donald Rumsfeld has had a long and distinguished career in public service. As a former Secretary of Defense and four-term Congressman, he understands the importance of government in providing vital services to citizens. However, he also believes that government should be a last resort, not a first.</p>
   <p>When he was serving as CEO of the pharmaceutical company G.D. Searle, Rumsfeld oversaw the development of a new product called NutraSweet. At the time, the FDA was requiring a lengthy and expensive approval process for new products. Rather than immediately turn to the government for help, Rumsfeld and his team took a different approach.</p>
   <blockquote>
    "We launched a massive public relations campaign to make sure that NutraSweet became a household word," Rumsfeld recalls. "We made sure that doctors and consumers knew about our product and how it could benefit them. We worked with voluntary organizations and local governments to spread the word."
   </blockquote>
   <p>The result? NutraSweet became one of the most successful products in the history of the industry, creating thousands of jobs and generating billions of dollars in revenue. And it was all done without relying on the federal government.</p>
   <p>Today, many Americans believe that government should be involved in nearly every aspect of our lives. From education to healthcare to retirement, we look to the government as the first and sometimes only solution to our problems. But is this really the best approach?</p>
   <h2>What is the role of the federal government?</h2>
   <p>There is no doubt that the federal government has an important role to play in American society. It is responsible for protecting our borders, maintaining law and order, and providing a safety net for those who cannot care for themselves. However, it is also important to remember that government is not the only solution.</p>
   <p>Ask yourself: is a potential program truly a federal responsibility, or can it be better handled by other means? Here are some options to consider:</p>
   <h3>Private organizations</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Charitable organizations can often provide more targeted and efficient assistance to those in need.</li>
    <li>Private businesses can sometimes provide goods and services more affordably and efficiently than the government.</li>
    <li>Volunteer groups can provide a range of services—from disaster relief to education—without relying on government funding.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>State and local governments</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Solutions tailored to local needs and priorities can be more effective than one-size-fits-all federal programs.</li>
    <li>State and local officials are often more responsive to the needs of their constituents than federal bureaucrats.</li>
    <li>States have different tax rates and policies, which can attract different businesses and industries to create unique opportunities.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Of course, not every program or problem can be solved by private organizations or state governments. But it is important to consider these alternatives before automatically turning to the federal government for help.</p>
   <h2>Examples of government overreach</h2>
   <p>There are plenty of examples throughout history that show the dangers of relying too heavily on the federal government. Here are just a few:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>The War on Poverty: launched in the 1960s, this federal initiative has spent trillions of dollars over the decades but has failed to significantly reduce poverty in America.</li>
    <li>The Affordable Care Act: this federal healthcare law promised to provide affordable insurance to all Americans, but has led to skyrocketing premiums and limited options for many.</li>
    <li>The Education Department: established in 1979, this federal agency has grown massively in size and budget yet has not dramatically improved American education outcomes.</li>
   </ol>
   <p>Again, this is not to say that government should have no role in these areas. But it is important to ask whether these issues could be better addressed by other means.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion: Three Points to Remember</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>The federal government should be a last resort, not a first.</li>
    <li>Private organizations, volunteer groups, and state/local governments can often provide better and more tailored solutions to problems.</li>
    <li>Government has an important role, but we should not automatically assume that it is the best solution for every problem.</li>
   </ol>
