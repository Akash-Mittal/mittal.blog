    <p>Years ago, a man named John had hit rock bottom. He had lost his job, his home, and his family. He had nothing left. But one day, a stranger came up to John and gave him money to get back on his feet. That act of generosity changed John's life forever. He was able to get a new job, find a new home, and reconnect with his family. From that day on, John made it his life's mission to give back to others, just as that stranger had done for him.</p>
