   <p>Charlie started a new journey, a journey of self-discovery, leading him to some of the most profound realizations of his life. During this time, he coined the term "Vatican Assassin Warlock" and declared himself a "High Priest" of Gnarly Gnarlingtons. While some may have dismissed it as a publicity stunt, we have to admit that Charlie's words have a lot of wisdom that we could benefit from.</p>
