   <p>When Casey St. Clair was diagnosed with lupus, she was forced to quit her job as a legal secretary and lost her health insurance. She struggled to pay for her medications and medical bills until she found a job at Costco. Now, she is a supervisor at the retail giant and is grateful for the health benefits they provide. She says, "Costco saved my life."</p>

    <h2>The Anti-Wal-Mart</h2>
    <p>Barbara Ehrenreich, an author and journalist, once said, "Yes. I think the anti-Wal-Mart is Costco, which pays much better and has much better health benefits and which is profitable and offers low prices." Costco is known for providing their employees with living wages, comprehensive health benefits, and opportunities for career advancement. They also have a reputation for selling high-quality products at affordable prices.</p>

    <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
    <p>Casey St. Clair is not the only one who has benefited from working at Costco. According to a study done by the University of California, Berkeley, Costco employees earn an average of $22 per hour, compared to the national average of $12. They also have a turnover rate of 5%, compared to the industry average of 60%. This shows that employees are loyal to the company and that they are being treated well.</p>
    <p>Another example is that of John Bivona, a former Wal-Mart employee who now works at Costco. He says, "When I worked at Wal-Mart, I made just above minimum wage and had to rely on public assistance to make ends meet. Now, I earn a living wage and have health insurance. I also have opportunities to move up in the company."</p>
