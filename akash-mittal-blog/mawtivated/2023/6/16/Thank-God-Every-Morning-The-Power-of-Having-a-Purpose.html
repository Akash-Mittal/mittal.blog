   <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
   <p>Jim Carrey, the actor and comedian, once shared a personal story in his commencement speech at Maharishi University of Management. He talked about his father, who once dreamed of a career in comedy but had to settle for a more practical job as an accountant to support his family.</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>"My father could have been a great comedian but he didn't believe that that was possible for him. So he made a conservative choice. Instead, he got a safe job as an accountant. And when I was 12 years old, he was let go from that safe job. Our family had to do whatever we could to survive. I learned many great lessons from my father, not the least of which was that you can fail at what you don't want, so you might as well take a chance on doing what you love."</p>

   <p>This story illustrates the importance of having a sense of purpose. When we have something to do that we are passionate about and believe in, it can inspire us to take risks and pursue a fulfilling career and life. But even if we don't have that kind of dream job, we can still find value in the everyday tasks that we have to do, as long as we approach them with a positive attitude and a sense of purpose.</p>
   <h2>Thank God Every Morning: The Power of Gratitude</h2>
   <p>The quotation mentioned in the title of this article is attributed to James Russell Lowell, an American poet and critic who lived in the nineteenth century. This quote succinctly captures a key attitude that can help us find purpose in our daily lives: gratitude.</p>
   <p>When we wake up each morning, we can choose to focus on all the tasks that we don't want to do and all the challenges we might face, or we can focus on the fact that we have the opportunity to make a difference in the world, no matter how small that difference might be. We can be grateful for the chance to learn new things, to connect with others, and to contribute to something larger than ourselves.</p>
   <p>Gratitude can also help us cope with the inevitable setbacks and obstacles that we will encounter. By focusing on what we do have rather than what we lack, we can find the motivation and resilience to keep going, even when things get tough.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Finding Purpose</h2>
   <p>There are countless ways to find purpose and meaning in our lives, and they don't all have to involve a dream job. Here are just a few examples:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Volunteering for a cause you believe in</li>
    <li>Making time for hobbies and interests that bring you joy</li>
    <li>Connecting with friends and loved ones on a regular basis</li>
    <li>Learning a new skill or taking a course to expand your knowledge</li>
    <li>Finding ways to give back to your community, whether through small acts of kindness or larger volunteer projects</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>To sum up, having a sense of purpose can give us the motivation, resilience, and fulfillment that we need to lead meaningful lives. Whether that purpose comes from pursuing a dream job, finding satisfaction in daily tasks, or connecting with others and contributing to something larger than ourselves, the important thing is to approach each day with gratitude and a positive attitude. So remember to thank God every morning for the chance to make a difference in the world, and to find joy and fulfillment in all that you do.</p>
