  <h2>Mark Twain's Story</h2>
  <p>Samuel Langhorne Clemens, better known by his pen name Mark Twain, was a renowned American author born in 1835 in Florida, Missouri. He was best known for his works, "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" and "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn." However, like many of us, Twain faced his fair share of difficulties. He lost his wife and two children, battled depression, and faced financial struggles.</p>
  <p>Yet, despite all the odds against him, Twain never gave up and continued to write. He was determined to leave his mark on the world with his stories and wit. It is this resilience that has made him an inspiration to many.</p>
