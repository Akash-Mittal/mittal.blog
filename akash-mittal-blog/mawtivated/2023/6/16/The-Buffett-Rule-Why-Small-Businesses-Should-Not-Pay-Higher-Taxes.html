  <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:18px;">Imagine starting a business from scratch, pouring your heart and soul into it, working long hours, investing your savings, and going through all the ups and downs of entrepreneurship. You finally see your hard work pay off, and your business starts making a profit. And then, you find out that you have to pay a higher tax rate than a multi-billion dollar corporation like Warren Buffett's. That's not fair, and that's why we need the Buffett Rule.</p>
  <h2 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#3E64AF">What is the Buffett Rule?</h2>
  <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:18px;">The Buffett Rule is a proposed tax reform that would ensure that the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes. The rule is named after Warren Buffett, who famously said that he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary. The idea behind the rule is simple: if you make more money, you should pay a higher tax rate.</p>
  <h2 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#3E64AF">Why Small Businesses Need the Buffett Rule</h2>
  <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:18px;">Small businesses are the backbone of America's economy. They account for more than 99% of all businesses, employ over 47% of the private sector workforce, and generate over $5.9 trillion in annual revenue. However, many small businesses struggle to survive, especially in the early years when they have to compete against larger corporations with more resources.</p>
  <blockquote style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: italic; font-size:20px;">
   "Small businesses should be given a fair chance to compete, and not be burdened with higher taxes than their bigger counterparts."
  </blockquote>
  <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:18px;">Small businesses should be given a fair chance to compete, and not be burdened with higher taxes than their bigger counterparts. Unfortunately, the current tax system often punishes small businesses and rewards large corporations. According to a report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, up to 60% of corporations with revenues over $1 billion paid no federal income taxes in 2020. Meanwhile, many small businesses are taxed as sole proprietorships, partnerships, or S-corporations, which means that their profits are taxed as personal income. This can result in a higher tax rate than what big corporations pay.</p>
  <h2 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#3E64AF">Rob Portman's Story</h2>
  <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:18px;">Rob Portman is a Republican Senator from Ohio. He is also a former businessman who co-founded a small business in Cincinnati. In an interview with Forbes, Portman shared his personal experience with the tax system:</p>
  <blockquote style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: italic; font-size:20px;">
   "When we started our business, we were in the highest tax bracket, and we had to pay almost 40% of our profits to the government. Meanwhile, we saw big corporations getting tax breaks and loopholes that allowed them to pay less than 10%."
  </blockquote>
  <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:18px;">Portman's story is not unique. Many small business owners feel frustrated by the tax system, and they believe that the government should do more to support them. The Buffett Rule is one way to level the playing field and give small businesses a fair chance.</p>
  <h2 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#3E64AF">Examples of the Buffett Rule in Action</h2>
  <ul style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:18px;">
   <li>The state of Colorado implemented the Buffett Rule for state income taxes in 2020. Under the new system, taxpayers making less than $250,000 per year pay a lower tax rate than those making more than $250,000. This change is expected to generate over $2 billion in additional revenue over the next two years, which will be used to fund education and health care.</li>
   <li>The city of San Francisco also implemented the Buffett Rule for local income taxes in 2018. Under the new system, taxpayers making more than $1 million per year pay an additional tax of 0.5%. This has helped to reduce income inequality and fund city services.</li>
   <li>The Biden administration has proposed a federal version of the Buffett Rule, which would increase the tax rate for those making over $400,000 per year. The proposal has been met with resistance from Republicans, who argue that it would hurt small businesses and job creation.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#3E64AF">Conclusion</h2>
  <ol style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:18px;">
   <li>The current tax system often punishes small businesses and rewards large corporations.</li>
   <li>The Buffett Rule is a proposed tax reform that would ensure that the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes.</li>
   <li>The Buffett Rule would level the playing field, give small businesses a fair chance, and generate additional revenue for public services.</li>
  </ol>
  <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:18px;">In conclusion, the Buffett Rule is not a silver bullet for all of America's economic challenges, but it is a step in the right direction. By ensuring that small businesses do not pay a higher tax rate than multi-billion dollar corporations, we can create a more fair and equitable society, where everyone has the opportunity to succeed.</p>
