  <h1>Shouldn't Democrats Insist that Sen. Durbin Step Down?</h1></br> <img src="images/Shouldn-t-Democrats-Insist-that-Sen-Durbin-Step-Down.jpeg" alt="+Shouldn-t-Democrats-Insist-that-Sen-Durbin-Step-Down+"></br>
  <p>Once upon a time, in a small town in the midwest, there was a senator who used derogatory language to describe the men and women who served in the military. He didn't mean to offend anyone, he said, but he couldn't help himself. He was angry about the war, and he wanted people to know it.</p>
  <p>For many people, this would have been the end of his political career. But the senator was a member of the Democratic Party, and they rallied around him. They said he was just speaking his mind, that he had a right to free speech, and that his comments weren't meant to be taken literally. They said he was a good man, with a good heart, and that he deserved a second chance.</p>
  <p>But some people disagreed. They said that his comments were hurtful and disrespectful, and that they showed a lack of judgment and character. They said that he should apologize, and that he should be held accountable for his words. And they said that the Democrats should insist that he step down as their whip, the number two man in their leadership.</p>
  <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
  <p>One person who holds this view is the author Bill Kristol. He has written extensively about the senator's remarks, and has argued that they are indicative of a larger problem within the Democratic Party.</p>
  <blockquote>
   "The fact that so many Democrats rushed to defend him, and refused to acknowledge the gravity of his comments, shows just how out of touch they are with the values of the American people. They seem more interested in scoring political points than in doing what's right."
  </blockquote>
  <p>Kristol is not alone in his criticism. Many veterans groups have also voiced their outrage at the senator's comments, and have called for him to resign from his leadership position. They say that his words have betrayed the trust that the American people have placed in him, and that he no longer deserves to hold public office.</p>
  <p>But the Democrats have remained steadfast in their support for the senator. They say that he is a valuable member of their team, and that his contributions to the party and the country far outweigh his recent misstep. They say that they will not be swayed by the demands of a vocal minority, and that they will continue to stand by their man.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Democratic Hypocrisy</h2>
  <p>Some people, however, see this as simply another example of Democratic hypocrisy. They say that if the situation were reversed, and a Republican had made similar comments about the military, the Democrats would be leading the charge to have him removed from office. They say that the Democrats are more interested in protecting their own than in doing what's right.</p>
  <p>And they point to other occasions where this has been the case. For example, when President Trump referred to some countries as "shitholes," the Democrats were quick to denounce him and demand an apology. But when Durbin made his comments, they were nowhere to be found.</p>
  <p>Another example is when Hillary Clinton referred to half of Trump's supporters as a "basket of deplorables." The Democrats defended her, saying that she was merely expressing her opinion, and that she had a right to do so. But when Durbin insulted the military, they didn't extend the same courtesy.</p>
  <ul>
   <li><b>Tip #1:</b> Be consistent in your principles. Don't defend one side when they do something wrong, and attack the other side when they do the same thing.</li>
   <li><b>Tip #2:</b> Hold your leaders accountable for their words and actions. Just because someone is on your team doesn't mean they can do no wrong.</li>
   <li><b>Tip #3:</b> Put the interests of the country above the interests of your party. Sometimes doing what's right means going against the party line.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>The </h2>
  <ol>
   <li>The Democratic Party should insist that Senator Durbin step down from his leadership position due to his derogatory remarks about the military.</li>
   <li>Democrats who defend Durbin are displaying hypocrisy and a lack of consistency in their principles.</li>
   <li>It's important to hold our elected leaders accountable for their words and actions, regardless of their party affiliation or position in the government.</li>
