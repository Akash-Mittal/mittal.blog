   <p>Adele Laurie Blue Adkins, known professionally as Adele, is one of the most successful and respected singers in the world today. Born on May 5, 1988, in Tottenham, North London, Adele was raised by a single mother who worked as a masseuse and furniture maker to support the family. Despite financial difficulties, Adele's mother always encouraged her daughter to pursue her passion for music.</p>
   <blockquote>
    "Mum loves me being famous! She is so excited and proud, as she had me so young and couldn't support me, so I am living her dream, it's sweeter for both of us. It's her 40th birthday soon and I'm going to buy her 40 presents."
   </blockquote>
