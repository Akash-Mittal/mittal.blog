  <h1>When Australia Was Involved In The Vietnam War - A Personal Account</h1></br> <img src="images/When-Australia-Was-Involved-In-The-Vietnam-War.jpeg" alt="+When-Australia-Was-Involved-In-The-Vietnam-War+"></br>
  <p>In the late 1960s, tensions were high as the Vietnam War raged on. Many countries, including Australia, were involved in this conflict, which lasted over 20 years. During this time, families had to come to terms with the reality of war, both on a national and personal level.</p>
  <p>My father, who was in his early 20s at the time, had grown up in Australia and had always been interested in military history. When Australia joined the war in the early 1960s, he decided to volunteer for service. However, his decision was not well received by his family, who feared for his safety and did not agree with the war. Despite this, he joined the army and was dispatched to Vietnam in 1965.</p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>"I can remember my dad telling us that if we were in Australia, we wouldn't be drafted until we were 20."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>My father was one of the lucky ones - he survived his tour of duty in Vietnam and returned home to Australia. However, many of his friends were not so fortunate. The experience of war left a profound impact on my father, and it was something that he carried with him for the rest of his life.</p>
  <h2>Australia's Involvement in the Vietnam War</h2>
  <p>Although Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War was controversial, the government had made the strategic decision to be a part of the conflict in order to bolster its alliance with the US and provide military support to its military forces in Asia. This involved sending troops to Vietnam, as well as providing logistical support and supplies.</p>
  <p>Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War lasted from 1962 to 1975, with over 60,000 Australian soldiers serving in the conflict. While it was a long and difficult war that spanned two decades, it was ultimately unsuccessful, with the communist forces of North Vietnam finally capturing Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam, in April 1975.</p>
  <h2>The Draft in Australia</h2>
  <p>During the Vietnam War, the Australian government introduced a lottery system to select individuals for conscription. The draft was initially focused on those aged 20 and over, who were deemed fit to serve in the military due to their age, health, and education. The lottery was designed to ensure that conscripts were selected fairly and could not avoid the draft based on their social status or connections.</p>
  <p>Those who were conscripted were required to serve for two years in the military, but many chose to enlist voluntarily in order to choose their preferred branch of service and receive additional training. While the draft was controversial, it did ensure that the army had enough personnel to fill the ranks and provide the support that was needed to aid the US in the conflict.</p>
  <h2>Mel Gibson's Story</h2>
  <p>One famous Australian who was affected by the Vietnam War was actor Mel Gibson. Gibson, who was born in the US but moved to Australia as a young child, was drafted into the Australian military in 1968, when he was just 12 years old. However, he was deemed too young to serve in the military and was subsequently discharged, which is something that he reflects on to this day.</p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>"I did go to the draft board, and the guy read out my name and said 'Are you kidding me?' I said 'Yeah? Why?' He said 'You're twelve years old!' And I said 'Oh, I'll be thirteen next year.' He said 'Get out of here!'"</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Gibson went on to become a successful actor, starring in movies such as Braveheart and Lethal Weapon. However, his experience with the draft highlights the ways in which the Vietnam War affected individuals of all ages and backgrounds.</p>
  <h2>Examples of How the War Affected Families</h2>
  <p>The Vietnam War took a toll on many families, both those who had loved ones serving in the military and those who opposed the war. Here are a few examples of how the war affected families in Australia:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>The Montgomery Family:</strong> The Montgomery family had two sons who were drafted into the military during the Vietnam War. Although both sons returned home safely after their tours, the experience of having two children serving in a war half a world away was incredibly stressful for the family.</li>
   <li><strong>The Thompson Family:</strong> The Thompson family were strong opponents of the Vietnam War. The family's father was a prominent anti-war activist, and both he and his children participated in rallies and protests throughout the conflict. While their views were unpopular at the time, they remained committed to standing up for what they believed in.</li>
   <li><strong>The Smith Family:</strong> The Smith family had a son who was drafted into the military during the Vietnam War. Although he returned home safely, his experience in the war left a profound impact on him. He struggled with PTSD and other mental health issues for many years after the war, which affected both him and his family.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Although Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War is now a matter of history, it is important to remember the experiences of those who lived through it. The war had a profound impact on many individuals and families, and it is something that we should never forget.</p>
