  <blockquote>
   "Man, being reasonable, must get drunk; the best of life is but intoxication."
  </blockquote>
  <p>Nothing but stars filled up the night sky when Lord Byron uttered these words, which became one of his famous quotes. It was during a luxurious yacht-party in 1821, on the coasts of Italy, where the romantic poet felt the most vivid manifestation of nature's beauty.</p>
  <p>The more we look up and reach out to touch these sparkling dots in the sky, the more we are reminded of the infinite possibilities and mysteries of the universe. From time immemorial, stars have been fascinating every human mind and cultures across the globe.</p><!-- Personal anecdote -->
  <p>I remember my uncle, who was an amateur astronomer, used to take me stargazing on crisp nights. He would point out certain constellations and tell me their stories, such as Orion and the Seven Sisters, as if they were characters with their own adventures and conflicts.</p><!-- The article with some examples -->
