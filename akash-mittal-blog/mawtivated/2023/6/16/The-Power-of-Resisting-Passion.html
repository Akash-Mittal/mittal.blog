   <p>Once upon a time, there was a young man named John. John had a passion for playing video games, and he would spend hours and hours playing them every day. Although he enjoyed playing video games, he realized that it was starting to take over his life. He would skip meals, neglect his studies, and ignore his friends and family just to play his favorite games.</p>
   <p>One day, John decided that he needed to change his ways and resist his passion for video games. It wasn't an easy task, but he started by limiting his game time to just a few hours a day. Then, he began to incorporate other activities, such as exercising and spending time with his loved ones, into his daily routine. Over time, he found that he was able to resist his passions and lead a more balanced and fulfilled life.</p>
   <p>The story of John is a perfect example of the power of resisting passion. As the quote by Francois de La Rochefoucauld suggests, it is not just our strength that allows us to resist our passions, but often the weakness of those passions themselves.</p>
   <h2>Who is Francois de La Rochefoucauld?</h2>
   <p>Francois de La Rochefoucauld was a French writer and philosopher who lived in the 17th century. He was known for his insightful observations about human nature, particularly in regards to love, friendship, and ambition. His famous book of maxims, "Maxims," contains over 500 pithy and often cynical statements about the human condition.</p>

   <p>When I was in college, I had a passion for partying. I would go out every night, drink excessively, and neglect my studies. It wasn't until I received a poor grade on an important assignment that I realized how much my passion was interfering with my life. I made a conscious effort to resist the temptation to go out every night and instead focused on my studies. Over time, I found that I was able to maintain a healthy balance between my social life and my academic responsibilities.</p>
