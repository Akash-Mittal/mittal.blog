   <p>As a child, J. C. Watts had a dream of becoming a quarterback in the NFL. He worked hard in high school and college to achieve his goal, but when he entered the draft in 1981, no one selected him. Refusing to give up, Watts tried out for the Ottawa Roughriders of the Canadian Football League and landed a spot on the team. He went on to have a successful career in the CFL and later played in the NFL with the New York Jets.</p>
   <p>Watts' perseverance and determination to achieve his dream is just one example of the American spirit that defines our nation. It's also a quality that former President George W. Bush embodied throughout his presidency. Although some people may criticize Bush for his shortcomings, history is likely to look upon him kindly. Here's why:</p>

    <li>He signed into law the No Child Left Behind Act, which aimed to help all students achieve their full potential by setting high standards and measuring progress.</li>
    <li>Bush worked to expand access to healthcare, signing into law Medicare Part D, which provided prescription drug coverage to millions of seniors, and supporting the creation of community health centers to serve low-income communities.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Bush's Leadership Style</h2>
   <p>Bush's leadership style was characterized by his strong convictions and willingness to make tough decisions even when they were unpopular. He believed in doing what was best for the country, even if it meant going against public opinion.</p>
   <blockquote>
    "Leadership to me means duty, honor, country. It means character, and it means listening from time to time."
   </blockquote>
   <p>His willingness to listen to different perspectives and make informed decisions helped him to navigate a complex political landscape and accomplish significant goals during his time in office.</p>
   <h2>Bush's Legacy</h2>
   <p>Although Bush's presidency was not without its challenges, it's important to remember the positive impact he had on our country. He demonstrated bravery and resilience in the face of unprecedented events, and his leadership set a strong example for future generations of Americans.</p>
   <p>As J. C. Watts once said, "Character is doing the right thing when nobody's looking." George W. Bush may not have been perfect, but he did his best to do what was right for the American people. For that, history is sure to be kind to him.</p>
