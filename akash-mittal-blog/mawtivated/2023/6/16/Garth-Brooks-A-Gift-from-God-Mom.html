  <p></p>
  <p>As a child growing up in Oklahoma, Garth Brooks loved music. He listened to his mom's Capitol Records and practiced guitar in his bedroom. He dreamed of becoming a country singer one day. That dream became a reality when he signed with Capitol Records himself and released his first album in 1989. Since then, Garth Brooks has become one of the most successful artists in country music history. But he knows he didn't get there on his own.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>"If I have any talent at all it's from God, and my mom, who was on Capitol Records also," Brooks once said. He understands that his gift and his success are not entirely his own doing. He recognizes that he has been blessed with talent and opportunity. But unlike some artists who take all the credit for their success, Brooks gives credit where credit is due. He attributes his talent to a higher power and to his mother, who was also a musician.</p>

  <p>Author - Garth Brooks story or background:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Garth Brooks' story is a testament to the power of hard work, persistence, and faith. As a young man, he played in bars and clubs around Oklahoma, honing his craft and building a small following. In 1987, he moved to Nashville, the country music capital of the world, to pursue a career as a singer-songwriter. At first, he struggled to make ends meet. He worked odd jobs and played gigs wherever he could. But he never gave up. He kept writing songs, playing shows, and hoping for his big break.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>That break came in 1988, when his friend, Rod Phelps, sent his demo to Capitol Records. The label was impressed and signed him to a deal. His first album, Garth Brooks, came out the following year and was an immediate success, thanks in part to the hit singles "If Tomorrow Never Comes" and "The Dance." Over the next decade, Brooks would release several more hit albums, including No Fences, Ropin' the Wind, and The Chase. He would win numerous awards, including two Grammys and 17 American Music Awards. He would sell over 170 million albums worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time.</p>
