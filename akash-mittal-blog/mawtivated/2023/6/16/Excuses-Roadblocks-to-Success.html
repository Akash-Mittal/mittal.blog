    <h2>Inspiring Story</h2>
    <p>Michael Jordan, widely considered the greatest basketball player of all time, wasn't born with natural talent and a passion for the sport. In fact, he was cut from his high school basketball team as a sophomore. He could have easily made excuses for his lack of skill and given up, but he didn't. Instead, he worked even harder to improve his game and became the player we all know and admire today.</p>
