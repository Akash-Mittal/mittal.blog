  <p>Once upon a time, there was a man named John. John had a good job, a loving family, and all the comforts of life. But he was always chasing after fame and fortune. He worked long hours, made sacrifices, and took risks, hoping that one day he would make it big.</p>
  <p>Years went by, and John did achieve some success. He became well-known in his industry, won awards, and made a lot of money. But he was never satisfied. He always wanted more. He kept comparing himself to others who were more famous or richer than him. He kept thinking that if he just worked harder or got luckier, he would finally reach the top.</p>
  <p>One day, John got sick. He was diagnosed with a terminal illness and given only a few months to live. Suddenly, his priorities changed. He realized that all the fame and fortune he had been chasing after was meaningless. What mattered most to him now was spending time with his family, enjoying simple pleasures, and making peace with himself and others. He wished he had learned this lesson earlier, but he was grateful for the chance to live his last days with dignity and love.</p>
  <h2>What is Fame?</h2>
  <p>Fame is a state of being widely known or recognized, especially for some achievement, talent, or personality trait. Fame can bring many benefits, such as money, influence, and social status. But fame can also bring many challenges, such as scrutiny, criticism, and loneliness. Fame is an illusion because it is based on the opinions and perceptions of others, which can change rapidly and unpredictably. One day you can be celebrated, the next day you can be forgotten. Fame is not a reliable source of happiness, fulfillment, or meaning.</p>
  <h2>What is Death?</h2>
  <p>Death is a natural and inevitable process of living organisms, in which the body ceases to function and the consciousness ceases to exist. Death can happen suddenly or gradually, through accidents, diseases, or old age. Death is not a punishment or a reward, but a part of the cycle of life. Death is not something to be feared or avoided, but something to be accepted and respected. Death is not the end of existence, but a transformation of energy and matter. Death is a reminder that life is precious and finite, and that every moment counts.</p>
  <h2>How to Live for the Moment?</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>Focus on what matters most to you: your values, your relationships, your passions.</li>
   <li>Be grateful for what you have now, instead of always wanting more or comparing yourself to others.</li>
   <li>Practice mindfulness, which means being present and aware of your thoughts, feelings, and surroundings without judging or reacting to them.</li>
   <li>Find ways to express yourself creatively, which means using your imagination, intuition, and emotions to create art, music, writing, or other forms of self-expression.</li>
   <li>Cultivate a sense of humor, which means being able to laugh at yourself, your mistakes, and your problems, and not taking yourself too seriously.</li>
   <li>Be kind to yourself and others, which means showing compassion, empathy, and respect to yourself and others, even in difficult situations.</li>
   <li>Embrace change and uncertainty, which means being open-minded, flexible, and adaptable to new experiences, challenges, and opportunities.</li>
  </ul>

   "Since fame is an illusion and death is in our future all we have is the next moment before we are swallowed into oblivion."

  <h2>Author Background: Al Goldstein</h2>
  <p>Al Goldstein was an American publisher, writer, and free speech activist, best known as the founder of Screw magazine, a hardcore pornographic publication that challenged the norms of mainstream media and censorship. Goldstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1936, and grew up in a middle-class Jewish family. He attended Pace College, but dropped out to pursue a career in advertising and publishing. In 1968, he launched Screw magazine, which became a huge success and a target of government and media censorship. Goldstein also hosted a public-access cable TV show called Midnight Blue, where he interviewed celebrities, politicians, and porn stars, and expressed his opinions on various social and political issues. Goldstein died in 2013, at the age of 77, from renal failure and other health problems. Goldstein was a controversial and complex figure, admired by some as a champion of free speech and sexual liberation, and reviled by others as a vulgar and exploitative pornographer.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion: Live for the Moment</h2>
  <p>1. Don't waste your time and energy on empty pursuits like fame and fortune.</p>
  <p>2. Don't fear or deny death, but embrace and appreciate life.</p>
  <p>3. Don't wait for tomorrow to be happy, but enjoy and create meaningful moments now.</p>
  <p>Remember, you don't have to be famous or rich to live a valuable and fulfilling life. You just have to be yourself, and live for the moment.</p>
