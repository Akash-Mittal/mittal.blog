  <p>Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni, commonly known as Michelangelo, was one of the greatest artists of all time. Born in 1475 in Florence, Italy, Michelangelo was a painter, sculptor, architect, and poet. He is best known for his magnificent sculptures, many of which were carved from marble.</p>
  <p>One of Michelangelo's most famous works is his statue of David. The statue stands at 17 feet tall and depicts the biblical hero David holding a stone in his right hand. Michelangelo began work on the statue in 1501 and completed it three years later. The statue is considered a masterpiece of Renaissance art and is now on display at the Accademia Gallery in Florence.</p>

   <p><i>"The best of artists has no conception that the marble alone does not contain within itself."</i></p>
  </div>
  <p>Michelangelo believed that his job as an artist was not to create something new, but to reveal what was already there. He saw marble as a living material that he could bring to life through his art. According to Michelangelo, the key to creating great art was to let the sculptor's imagination merge with the natural qualities of the stone to create a masterpiece.</p>
  <p>Michelangelo learned his craft by studying with some of the greatest artists of his time. At the age of 14, he became an apprentice to Domenico Ghirlandaio, a painter and mosaicist. Later, he studied sculpture under Bertoldo di Giovanni, a pupil of the famous artist Donatello. Michelangelo's first major commission came when he was just 21 years old. He was asked to create a statue of the Madonna and Child for a church in Bruges, Belgium.</p>
  <p>Despite his success, Michelangelo was never completely satisfied with his work. He believed that he could always do better, and he was constantly challenging himself to improve. He often worked for days on end without sleep, driven by his passion for art.</p>
