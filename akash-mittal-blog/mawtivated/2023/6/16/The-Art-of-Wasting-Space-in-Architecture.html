     <h2>Inspiring Story</h2>
     <p>It was a warm summer day when Sarah decided to take a trip to the city. As she wandered down the streets, she couldn't help but notice the beautiful architecture surrounding her. Each building was unique and unlike anything she had ever seen before. But as she looked closer, Sarah noticed that some of the buildings seemed to waste a lot of space. Curious, she decided to do some research on the subject and discovered that architecture is indeed the art of how to waste space.</p>

     <h2>Author - Philip Johnson</h2>
     <p>Philip Johnson, an American architect and founder of the Department of Architecture and Design at the Museum of Modern Art, once said, "Architecture is the art of how to waste space." Johnson believed that empty space plays a crucial role in the design of a building, as it not only enhances the overall aesthetic appeal, but also allows for functionality and flexibility. He believed that empty space should be used as a tool to create balance and harmony within a space, rather than simply filling it with objects.</p>

     <h2>Examples</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>In the Guggenheim Museum in New York, the empty space within the spiral design of the building is just as important as the artwork displayed within it.</li>
      <li>In the Barcelona Pavilion in Spain, the use of empty space creates a sense of tranquility and calmness within the otherwise busy and bustling city.</li>
      <li>In the Fallingwater house in Pennsylvania, the use of empty space allows for the integration of the surrounding natural landscape into the design of the house.</li>
     </ul>
