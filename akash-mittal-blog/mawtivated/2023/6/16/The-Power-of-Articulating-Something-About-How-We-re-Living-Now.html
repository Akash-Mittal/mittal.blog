  <p>Have you ever watched a movie that deeply resonated with you? A movie that left you feeling altered after having seen it?

  <p>Actor and director Josh Radnor once stated, "When I go to movies and I love the movie, it's because it feels like it articulated something about how we're living now, and also gives me some insight into my own life."</p>
  <p>Radnor, best known for his role in the TV show <em>How I Met Your Mother</em>, has always been passionate about storytelling. He has written and directed several indie films, including <em>Liberal Arts</em> and <em>Happiness Runs</em>.</p><!-- Examples -->
