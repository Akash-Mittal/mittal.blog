    <h3>Once upon a time...</h3>
    <p>There lived a girl named Mia who had just graduated from college. She was an ambitious young woman with a bright future ahead of her, until she fell in love with a boy named Luke.</p>
    <p>Luke was not the kind of guy that Mia's parents approved of. He played in a band, had a few tattoos, and didn't have a steady job. Despite all of this, Mia was head over heels in love with him.</p>
    <p>Her parents warned her about getting involved with someone like Luke, but Mia didn't listen. She felt alive and happy when she was with him, and that was all that mattered to her. She didn't care about his flaws or what others thought of him. She loved him for who he was.</p>
    <p>One day, Mia's parents gave her an ultimatum - leave Luke or get disowned. Mia was devastated. She loved her parents, but she also loved Luke. She didn't know what to do.</p>
    <p>That's when she remembered a famous quote by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe - "If I love you, what business is it of yours?" She realized that her love for Luke was her own personal choice, and it was not up to anyone else to dictate who she should love.</p>

    <h3>Background on Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</h3>
    <p>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was a German writer and statesman who lived in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. He was widely regarded as one of the greatest literary figures in Western history, known for his plays, poetry, and novels.</p>
    <p>Goethe was a firm believer in personal choice and individual will. He felt that it was important for people to make their own decisions, even if those decisions went against societal conventions.</p>
    <p>His quote "If I love you, what business is it of yours?" is often used to express the idea that love is a personal choice, and that others should not interfere with whom we choose to love.</p>
