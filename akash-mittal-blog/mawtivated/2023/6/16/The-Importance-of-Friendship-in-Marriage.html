    <p>Sam and Jessica had a love story straight out of a fairy tale. They met in college and immediately fell in love. After graduation, they got married and began their happily ever after. At least that's what they thought. A year into their marriage, they found themselves arguing and unhappy. It wasn't because they didn't love each other; it was because they had forgotten to be friends.</p>
    <p>Their busy lives, work schedules, and different interests led them to drift apart. They stopped communicating, stopped doing things together, and stopped encouraging each other. They were together but felt alone because they had forgotten to cultivate their friendship.</p>

Friedrich Nietzsche once said, "It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages." In this article, we'll explore the importance of friendship in marriage and how to nurture this vital aspect of your relationship.</p>
