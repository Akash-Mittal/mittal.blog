    <p>"You can trust a Neil Simon script. Every dot. Every dash that pause means something. He takes all the jokes out, practically." - Hector Elizondo</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>As a young aspiring actor, I was clueless about what makes great scripts. But that all changed when I discovered Neil Simon's plays. His scripts were so well-crafted, so precise in their comedy and drama, that they felt like gold to me. And through my years of performing in Simon's works, I came to appreciate just how much attention to detail went into his writing.</p>
   <p>For those who may not be familiar, Neil Simon was a legendary playwright and screenwriter who passed away in 2018. He was a master of comedy, crafting timeless works like "The Odd Couple," "Barefoot in the Park," and "Brighton Beach Memoirs," among many others. His plays were known for their razor-sharp wit, relatable characters, and impeccable timing.</p>
   <h2>The Art of Precision in Writing</h2>
   <p>What made Neil Simon's scripts so special was their precision. Every word, every line, every pause was deliberate. As Hector Elizondo said in his quote, "every dot, every dash, that pause means something." Simon was a master of comedic timing, knowing exactly when to insert a joke or a beat to build the tension in a scene. And he was equally adept at writing powerful dramatic moments, such as the poignant father-son conversations in "Lost in Yonkers."</p>
   <p>One example of Simon's precision is in "The Odd Couple," where roommates Oscar and Felix have a hilarious exchange about their differing attitudes towards housekeeping. Oscar, the slob, insists that "when I want to find something, I want the place to be messy...it wouldn't be in such a good place if I knew where it was." Felix, the neat freak, counters with "I don't want a place for everything and everything in its place...I want things where I need them." The back-and-forth banter is both hilarious and perfectly timed, showcasing Simon's knack for capturing the nuances of human behavior.</p>
   <h2>The Importance of Taking Out the Jokes</h2>
   <p>Another key aspect of Neil Simon's writing was his ability to take out the jokes. As Hector Elizondo said, Simon "takes all the jokes out, practically." By this, he meant that Simon's humor didn't rely on easy one-liners or cheap gags. Instead, Simon's comedy was rooted in character and situation. He created fully-realized people with distinct personalities, quirks, and flaws, and then placed them in hilarious and relatable situations.</p>
   <p>An example of this can be seen in "The Sunshine Boys," where two aging vaudeville comedians, played by George Burns and Walter Matthau, struggle to reunite and put on a show despite their long-standing animosity towards each other. The humor in the play comes from their personalities and the contrast between their old-fashioned style of comedy and the modern world. There are no cheap laughs in "The Sunshine Boys" - just richly-drawn characters who make us laugh through their flaws and foibles.</p>
   <h2>The Legacy of Neil Simon's Writing</h2>
   <p>Despite his passing, Neil Simon's legacy lives on. His plays are still performed regularly in theaters around the world, and his influence can be felt in the work of countless other writers and performers. But beyond the accolades and awards, what makes Simon's writing so enduring is its humanity. His characters are flawed and imperfect, but also relatable and lovable. His stories are funny and poignant, capturing the joys and challenges of the human experience.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <li>Neil Simon was a master of precision in writing, with every word and line carefully crafted.</li>
