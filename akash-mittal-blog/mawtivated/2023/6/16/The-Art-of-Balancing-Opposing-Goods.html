    <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
    <h3>1. Set Realistic Goals</h3>
    <p>It is important to set realistic goals that take into account both the goods that you are trying to balance. For example, if you want to achieve a promotion at work, you must also make time for your personal life and health. Set goals that align with your values and prioritize them accordingly.</p>
    <h3>2. Schedule Your Time</h3>
    <p>One of the best ways to balance opposing goods is to schedule your time. Set aside time for work, personal life, and health. Make sure that you give each good the time and attention it deserves. For example, if you want to spend more time with your family, schedule a regular family night once a week.</p>
    <h3>3. Be Mindful</h3>
    <p>Being mindful is a key component of balancing opposing goods. Pay attention to how much time and energy you are devoting to each good. If you find that you are neglecting one good too much, take steps to correct the balance. For example, if you are spending too much time working and not enough time on your health, take regular breaks to exercise or meditate.</p>
