    <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
    <p>When I was in middle school, I had a huge crush on a boy in my class. He was popular, athletic, and always seemed to be surrounded by friends. I, on the other hand, was shy, nerdy, and desperately wanted to fit in. One day, I mustered up the courage to wear a new outfit to school in the hopes that it would catch his attention. I spent all day worrying about what he and everyone else would think of me.</p>
    <p>At the end of the day, as I walked home feeling embarrassed and defeated, a group of students ran up to me and exclaimed, "We've been trying to catch you all day! That outfit is so cool! Where did you get it?" I was shocked and relieved that someone not only noticed me, but actually thought positively of me.</p>
    <p>This experience taught me a valuable lesson that has stuck with me throughout my life: people are often too busy worrying about themselves to constantly think about others.</p>
    <h2>The Importance of Self-Esteem</h2>
    <p>It's natural to care about what others think of you. However, when that concern becomes overwhelming, it can severely impact your self-esteem. Low self-esteem can lead to a host of problems, including anxiety, depression, and difficulty forming relationships. Therefore, it's essential to learn how to worry less about what others think of you.</p>
    <h2>Understanding the Frequency of Thoughts</h2>
    <p>My dad's quote, "You wouldn't worry so much about what people thought about you if you knew how seldom they did," is a great reminder that people simply don't think about us as often as we may think.</p>
    <p>In fact, a study from the National Science Foundation found that the average person has about 50,000 thoughts per day. That equates to roughly 35 thoughts per minute! With so much going on in our minds, it's highly unlikely that anyone is constantly thinking about us.</p>
    
    <p>Years after my middle school experience, I ran into the boy who I had the crush on. I nervously asked him if he remembered me, to which he replied, "Of course! You were the girl who always wore that really cool outfit." I was shocked that my outfit had made such a lasting impression on him, but it also reinforced the idea that people may remember specific things about us, but they're not constantly thinking about us as a whole.</p>
    <h2>Examples of Overcoming the Fear</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>When speaking in front of a group, focus on the message you're trying to convey instead of worrying about how you look or sound</li>
     <li>When meeting new people, remind yourself that they're likely more concerned about how they come across than judging you</li>
     <li>If someone says something negative about you, take a moment to evaluate whether their opinion truly matters to you or not</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion: Worry Less for More Confidence</h2>
    <p>Worrying about what others think of us can become an all-consuming cycle that leads to low self-esteem. However, with the understanding that people don't think about us as often as we may fear, we can take steps to worry less and build our confidence.</p>
    <h3>Three key takeaways:</h3>
    <ol>
     <li>Remember that people have many other things on their minds and aren't constantly thinking about you.</li>
     <li>Focus on the positive things people have said about you in the past rather than dwelling on the negative.</li>
     <li>Practice self-compassion and strive to be comfortable in your own skin, even if it means being vulnerable at times.</li>
    </ol>
