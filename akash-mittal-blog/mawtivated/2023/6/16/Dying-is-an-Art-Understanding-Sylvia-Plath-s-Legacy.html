    <h2>The Art of Dying</h2>
    <p>As Sylvia Plath once said, "Dying is an art, like everything else." It's a truth that we don't often consider, but it's one that's worth exploring. Death is a natural part of life, and yet it's something we often shy away from. We don't want to think about it, let alone talk about it. But what if we approached death as an art form? What if we saw it as a way to express ourselves, to connect with others, and to find beauty in even the darkest of moments?</p>
    <ul>
     <li>We can learn from those who have gone before us. People like Sylvia Plath, who lived with a profound awareness of their mortality.</li>
     <li>We can also learn from those who are facing death head-on, like Emily. Their stories remind us that there is strength and beauty to be found in even the most difficult circumstances.</li>
     <li>Ultimately, the art of dying is about living a life that's true to who we are, even in the face of death. It's about finding meaning, purpose, and hope even in the darkest of moments.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
     "I do it exceptionally well. I do it so it feels like hell. I do it so it feels real. I guess you could say I've a call." - Sylvia Plath
