   <p>Let me tell you a story about a young boy named <strong>Jack.</strong> When Jack was in school, he loved playing basketball, but never made it to the school's basketball team, because he was too short. Despite this setback, he continued to practice day and night. After months of intense practice, he grew taller, stronger and was able to dunk the ball with ease. Jack persisted and pushed beyond his limits, regardless of what others had said about his inability to play the sport.</p>
   <p>This story reminds us of our duty as men and women - to break limits and proceed as though the limits of our abilities do not exist. This quote by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin inspires us to unleash our hidden potentials and become the best version of ourselves.</p>
   <blockquote><em>"It is our duty as men and women to proceed as though the limits of our abilities do not exist."</em> - Pierre Teilhard de Chardin
   </blockquote>
   <h2>The Author - Pierre Teilhard de Chardin</h2>
   <p>Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was a French philosopher and Jesuit priest whose ideas on the evolution of humans and the universe have inspired generations. He believed that there is a higher purpose for humanity that can only be realized through the development of the human consciousness. His writings have influenced and inspired many to break out of their limitations and strive for excellence.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Breaking Limits</h2>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Katrina Lake</strong> started Stitch Fix, an online personal styling service as a Harvard business student, following her dream of creating a solution for busy women who don't have time for shopping but still want to look good. Today, her company's revenue stands at $1.7 billion.</li>
    <li><strong>Mohammed Ali</strong> is considered to be one of the greatest boxers of all time, with an incredible record of 56 wins, 37 of which were by knockout. Ali was known for his charisma, confidence and outspokenness, but above all else, it was his unwavering belief in himself that allowed him to achieve greatness.</li>
    <li><strong>Kamala Harris</strong> made history as the first Black woman vice president of the United States. She broke the political glass ceiling with her intelligence, passion and commitment to the American people, inspiring others to believe that they too can make a difference.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion - 3 Points to Remember</h2>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>Believe in Yourself</strong> - The first step towards breaking limits is to believe in your abilities. No matter what others say, you have the power to achieve your goals if you put your mind to it.</li>
    <li><strong>Be Persistent</strong> - Success is not always immediate, but with hard work and persistence, you will get there. Remember that failure is not the opposite of success, but a part of the journey towards it.</li>
    <li><strong>Take Risks</strong> - Taking risks is a crucial part of breaking limits. You have to step outside your comfort zone and be willing to try new things in order to reach your full potential.</li>
