    <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
    <p>When Edison was inventing the light bulb, he tried more than 10,000 times before he succeeded. Thomas Edison was not alone in his dedication to his dream. Every great leader and inventor started with a simple idea or hypothesis and continued to pursue it even when others doubted them.</p>
    <p>This is the power of having a belief that drives you, even in the face of failure. Edison believed electricity could light up the world, and his persistence inspired countless others with his vision. He used his failures as stepping stones rather than setbacks, saying, "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."</p>

    <h2>Author - Edward Teller</h2>
    <p>Edward Teller was a Hungarian-born American theoretical physicist who is known colloquially as "the father of the hydrogen bomb." Teller was a pioneer in the development of nuclear energy and contributed significantly to the field of physics. He was a man who believed in testing theories to find new solutions.</p>
    <p>Teller once said that he thought "upset" was the most useful word in the English language. He believed that an idea or hypothesis could be overturned at any time because there is always new information to be found. In his mind, an upset idea was not a failure, but rather an opportunity to learn and start again.</p>

    <h2>Facts vs. Hypotheses</h2>
    <p>A fact is a statement that is indisputable and generally accepted as true. It is a statement that can be proven and is based on empirical evidence. A hypothesis is a statement that is not yet proven and requires further testing and experimentation.</p>
    <ol>
     <li>A fact is a simple statement that everyone believes. It is innocent, unless found guilty.</li>
     <li>A hypothesis is a novel suggestion that no one wants to believe. It is guilty, until found effective.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The difference between a fact and a hypothesis is that a fact is already proven, while a hypothesis requires further testing and experimentation to be confirmed. It's important to note that a hypothesis isn't necessarily a bad thing, as it can inspire new ideas and theories, leading to breakthroughs that couldn't have otherwise been made.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>An example of a fact is that the Earth is round. This statement is based on empirical evidence and has been proven for centuries. In contrast, an example of a hypothesis is that there is life on other planets. While it has not been proven, it is a statement that can inspire further exploration and experimentation.</p>
    <p>Another example is in medicine. A fact is that aspirin is an effective treatment for reducing inflammation and fever. A hypothesis could be that a new drug is effective in curing cancer. While it has not yet been proven, it can motivate scientists to continue researching for a cure.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>Facts provide a solid foundation for our understanding of the world.</li>
     <li>Hypotheses can inspire new ideas and lead to breakthroughs that are essential for progress.</li>
     <li>Both facts and hypotheses are valuable when used appropriately and in the right context.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The key is to have an open mind, to be willing to accept new ideas, and to never give up on your dreams. Like Edison and Teller, it's essential to keep trying and experimenting until you succeed. Lead with a hypothesis, but be willing to pivot and always test your theories. That is the path to success.</p>
