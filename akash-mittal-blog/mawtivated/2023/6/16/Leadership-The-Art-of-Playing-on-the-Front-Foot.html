   <h2>A story of how Larry Bird inspired a generation of leaders</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>It was the final of the 1983 NBA championship, and the Boston Celtics were trailing by two points with just a few seconds left on the clock. As the ball was inbounded, everyone in the arena knew that the team's star player, Larry Bird, would be the one to take the final shot.</p>
   <p>But what happened next was not what anyone expected.</p>
   <p>As Bird prepared to shoot, he saw that one of his teammates, Dennis Johnson, was unmarked and had a better chance of scoring. Without a moment's hesitation, Bird passed the ball to Johnson, who scored the winning basket and secured the championship for the Celtics.</p>
   <p>This selfless act of leadership is just one example of why Larry Bird is considered one of the greatest basketball players of all time. But it also provides a valuable lesson for anyone striving to become a better leader.</p>
   <h3>The Characteristics of Effective Leaders</h3>
   <p>Leadership is not just about giving orders and expecting others to follow. In fact, the most effective leaders are those who lead by example and inspire their team to be the best they can be. Here are some of the qualities that set great leaders apart from the rest:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Vision</strong> - Great leaders have a clear idea of where they want to go and how to get there.</li>
    <li><strong>Communication</strong> - Effective leaders are able to communicate their vision and goals clearly to their team.</li>
    <li><strong>Courage</strong> - Good leaders are not afraid to take risks and make tough decisions when necessary.</li>
    <li><strong>Empathy</strong> - Successful leaders are able to understand and relate to their team members, which helps build trust and morale.</li>
    <li><strong>Selflessness</strong> - Exceptional leaders put the needs of their team ahead of their own ego and personal interests.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>The Importance of Leading from the Front</h3>
   <p>One of the key aspects of leadership is setting an example for others to follow. This means being willing to get your hands dirty and do the hard yards alongside your team.</p>
   <p>As Larry Bird put it, "Leadership is diving for a loose ball, getting the crowd involved, getting other players involved. It's being able to take it as well as dish it out. That's the only way you're going to get respect from the players."</p>
   <p>By being on the front foot and leading from the trenches, you not only show your team that you are willing to do what it takes to achieve success, but you also gain their respect and trust.</p>
   <h3>Three Tips for Becoming a Better Leader</h3>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>Listen to Your Team</strong> - Effective communication is a two-way street. Take the time to listen to your team's concerns and ideas, and make them feel heard.</li>
    <li><strong>Lead by Example</strong> - Don't ask others to do something you're not willing to do yourself. Show your team that you are committed to achieving your shared goals.</li>
    <li><strong>Be Self-Aware</strong> - Understand your strengths and weaknesses as a leader, and work on improving your skills. Seek feedback from others and be open to constructive criticism.</li>
   </ol>
