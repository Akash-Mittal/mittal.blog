He joined his school's football team, and with hard work, dedication, and talent, he became the team's captain. His team was competing in the national championship, and they were one point behind with only a few seconds left on the clock. Jordan had the ball, and he knew that this was the moment he had been waiting for. He ran, dodged, and scored the winning touchdown, leading his team to victory.
