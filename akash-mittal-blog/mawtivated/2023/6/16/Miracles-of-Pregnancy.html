After several rounds of IVF, Sarah successfully became pregnant with her daughter Ava.

    <h2>The Science Behind Pregnancy</h2>
    <p>Pregnancy is truly miraculous. It is a process through which the female body transforms itself from a reproductive organ to a protective environment for the growing fetus. It involves complex hormonal changes, structural adaptations, and a constant communication between the mother and the developing baby. To understand the science behind pregnancy is to appreciate the beauty and complexity of life.</p>
    <h3>Some Examples:</h3>
    <ul>
     <li>The uterus expands from the size of a pear to the size of a watermelon within 9 months.</li>
     <li>The placenta is an organ that forms within the uterus and provides nutrients, oxygen, and waste removal for the baby. It is the only organ that is created and then destroyed within the human body.</li>
     <li>The baby's first heartbeat can be detected as early as 6 weeks gestation.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Practical Tips:</h3>
    <ul>
     <li>Eat a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and protein.</li>
     <li>Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water.</li>
     <li>Exercise regularly, but consult with your doctor first.</li>
