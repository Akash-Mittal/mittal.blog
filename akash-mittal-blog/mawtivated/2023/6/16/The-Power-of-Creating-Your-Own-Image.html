   <p>Have you ever felt like you didn't fit in, like there was no one else like you? It's a common feeling, especially when it comes to our appearance. In fact, even a famous movie star like Michael Caine has experienced this feeling.</p>
   <blockquote>
    "My problem was that I was blond. There were no heroes with blond hair. Robert Taylor and Henry Fonda, they all had dark hair. The only one I found was Van Johnson, who wasn't too cool. He was a nice, homely American boy. So I created my own image. It worked."
   </blockquote>
