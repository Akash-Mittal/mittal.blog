   <p>Let me share a story with you. Once upon a time, there was a young boy named John who was born and raised in a small town. John was an average student but always had big dreams. He wanted to become a successful businessman and make his parents proud.</p>
   <p>One day, John attended a seminar on self-improvement, and the speaker quoted Jiddu Krishnamurti: "In oneself lies the whole world and if you know how to look and learn, the door is there and the key is in your hand. Nobody on earth can give you either the key or the door to open, except yourself."</p>
   <p>This quote deeply resonated with John and changed his life forever. He realized that he had the power within himself to achieve his dreams and open the door to success. From that day on, John started taking responsibility for his life and worked hard to make his dreams come true. And eventually, he did become a successful businessman, just as he had always imagined.</p>
