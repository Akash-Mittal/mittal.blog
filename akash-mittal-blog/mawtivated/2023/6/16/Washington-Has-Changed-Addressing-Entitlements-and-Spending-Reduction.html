  <h3>An Inspiring Story: How One Person's Struggle With Debt Changed the Conversation in Washington</h3>
  <p>Mark Zandi, a respected economist, was in debt. He had carefully managed his family's finances over the years, but unexpected medical bills and the rising cost of living had taken a toll. He was struggling to make ends meet, and he knew he wasn't alone.</p>

  <h3>The Changing Tone in Washington</h3>
