   <p>An Inspirational Story by Emanuel Cleaver</p>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>When I was growing up in Kansas City, Missouri, I was always fascinated by technology and computers. However, I didn't have access to the kind of training and programs needed to learn these skills. It wasn't until I attended a community college that I was able to gain the necessary knowledge and experience to pursue a career in technology.</p>
   <p>Today, our country is facing a similar challenge. According to a report by the National Skills Coalition, there are over 7 million job vacancies in the United States, but many of them are going unfilled due to a lack of specialized skills and training. This is where community colleges can play a critical role.</p>
   <h2>The Need for Upgrading Community Colleges</h2>
   <p>Community colleges play a vital role in our education system, providing affordable and accessible education to millions of students each year. However, in order to meet the needs of the job market, these colleges need to be upgraded and modernized. This means investing in new technology, innovative programs, and qualified instructors.</p>
   <p>As Congressman Tom Reed has stated, "Economic growth and job creation hinge on a skilled workforce. Community colleges have a unique role to play in providing skills and training required for 21st century jobs."</p>
   <h2>The Gap in Technology Skills</h2>
   <p>One of the biggest challenges facing our workforce today is the gap in technology skills. As technology continues to advance at a rapid pace, many workers are struggling to keep up. This is particularly true for recent college graduates, who may have a solid academic background but lack the practical skills needed to succeed in today's workplace.</p>
   <p>According to former Congresswoman from the state of Missouri, Alma Adams, "Community colleges need to focus on providing training for real jobs. We've got a lot of jobs that are going unfilled because we don't have the technology in the heads of graduating college students to deal with them."</p>
   <h2>The Importance of Hands-On Learning</h2>
   <p>One of the biggest advantages of attending a community college is the emphasis on hands-on learning. Unlike traditional four-year universities, community colleges are often focused on providing their students with practical experience through internships, job shadowing, and other real-world opportunities.</p>
   <p>In addition, community colleges can often provide more specialized training programs in areas such as healthcare, culinary arts, and other fields where hands-on experience is essential.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion: Upgrading Community Colleges in Three Points</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Investing in new technology</li>
    <li>Providing innovative programs</li>
    <li>Hiring qualified instructors</li>
   </ol>
   <p>If we want to ensure that our workforce is prepared for the jobs of the future, we need to invest in our community colleges. By upgrading these institutions and providing students with the skills and experience they need to succeed, we can help bridge the gap in the job market and create a stronger and more prosperous economy.</p>
