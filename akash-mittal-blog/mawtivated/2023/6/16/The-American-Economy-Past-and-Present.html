  <h1>The American Economy: Past and Present</h1></br> <img src="images/The-American-Economy-Past-and-Present.jpeg" alt="+The-American-Economy-Past-and-Present+"></br>
  <p>Let me tell you a story.</p>
  <p>Meet Jane. Jane grew up in a small town in America. Her parents worked hard to provide for her and her siblings but their income was not enough to pay for higher education. Jane was a bright student and dreamed of going to college, but the costs seemed insurmountable. However, the policies and developments of the 1950s and 60s paved the way for Jane to achieve her dreams.</p>
  <p>The interstate-highway system made it easier for people to travel across the country, opening up new opportunities. Massive funding for science and technology led to innovations that would change the world, including the internet. The public-education system that was the envy of the world provided access to education for many, including Jane. Generous immigration policies brought in people from all over the world, adding to the diversity and richness of America.</p>
  <p>These policies and developments helped create the foundation for the American economy to boom. The growth of the American economy has created countless opportunities for people like Jane to achieve their dreams and has led to America becoming a global economic superpower.</p>
