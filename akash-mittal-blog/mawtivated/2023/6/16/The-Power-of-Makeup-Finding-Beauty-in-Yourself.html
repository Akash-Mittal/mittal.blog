   <p>Have you ever felt insecure about your appearance? Maybe you didn't like the shape of your nose, the color of your skin, or the size of your lips. It's easy to get caught up in these negative thoughts and forget that beauty comes in all shapes and sizes.</p>
   <p>That's why makeup artist Kevyn Aucoin started doing makeup in the first place. He understood that helping people see the beauty in themselves could also help him find it in himself.</p>
   <blockquote>
