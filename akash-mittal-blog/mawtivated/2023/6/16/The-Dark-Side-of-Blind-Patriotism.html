  <h1>The Dark Side of Blind Patriotism</h1></br> <img src="images/The-Dark-Side-of-Blind-Patriotism.jpeg" alt="+The-Dark-Side-of-Blind-Patriotism+"></br>
  <p>It was a sunny day in April 2019 when I was on a hiking trip in the mountains with a bunch of friends. We were climbing up a steep trail when we saw a group of people gathered around a small shop at the base camp.</p>
  <p>As we reached closer, we saw an old ragpicker with a bag full of empty bottles begging for some food. The shopkeeper yelled at him and shooed him away, cursing him for being a beggar and a parasite on society.</p>
  <p>But then, something unexpected happened. One of the young soldiers posted at the nearby army base, who was lining up for his turn to buy snacks and drinks, came forward, gave the old man some money and apologized on behalf of the shopkeeper.</p>
  <p>The old man hesitated at first, then smiled gratefully and blessed him. The young soldier saluted him and went back to his queue. The shopkeeper, taken aback by this unexpected act of kindness, lowered his head in shame and quietly gave the old man some food.</p>
  <p>In that brief moment, I witnessed a stark contrast between two faces of patriotism; the blind and the civilized. On one hand, there was a shopkeeper who claimed to love his country but failed to love his fellow human being. On the other hand, there was a soldier who not only fought for his country but also showed compassion to a stranger in need.</p>
  <h2>What is Patriotism?</h2>
  <p><q>We do not consider patriotism desirable if it contradicts civilized behavior.</q></p>
  <p>These words of Friedrich Durrenmatt, a Swiss writer, and playwright, capture the essence of true patriotism. Patriotism, in its simplest form, is a love and devotion to one's country. It is a feeling of attachment and loyalty towards the homeland, its people, and its values. However, true patriotism is not just about waving flags, singing anthems, or following blind traditions.</p>
  <p>It goes beyond the emotions of pride and honor, and encompasses civilized behavior based on rational thinking, empathy, and morality. It is about standing up for the rights and dignity of all citizens, irrespective of their race, religion, or status. It is about promoting peace, justice, and equality, both at home and abroad.</p>
  <h2>The Dark Side of Blind Patriotism</h2>
  <p>However, as is often the case in this world, every virtue has a vice. Blind patriotism, characterized by a uncritical adherence to nationalistic symbols and slogans, can be a dangerous force that leads to intolerance, aggression, and violence.</p>
  <p>When patriotism turns into fanaticism, it can become a justification for committing atrocities against those who are deemed as enemies or outsiders. It can justify war, torture, genocide, racism, and extremism in the name of a greater good or a higher cause.</p>
  <p>What is even more disturbing is that blind patriotism is often fueled by propaganda, censorship, and fear-mongering, which manipulate the mass emotions of the people and distort their views of reality. Historically, we can see examples of this in Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, Maoist China, and other authoritarian regimes where individual freedoms were sacrificed at the altar of nationalistic ideology and the cult of personality.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Civilized Patriotism</h2>
  <p>However, not all is lost in the sea of blind patriotism. There are still many examples of people who have shown the true spirit of civilized patriotism through their actions and words.</p>
  <p>Take the case of Malala Yousafzai, the young Pakistani girl who stood up for the rights of girls to education and was shot by the Taliban for her activism. She not only survived the bullet but went on to become a global advocate for education and human rights, winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</p>
  <p>Or the case of Nelson Mandela, the South African leader who fought against the racist regime of apartheid and spent 27 years in prison before becoming the first black president of his country. He not only forgave his oppressors but also promoted reconciliation, forgiveness, and unity among all South Africans, black and white.</p>
  <p>These are just two of the many examples of individuals who have shown that patriotism can be a force for good, not just for one's own nation but for humanity as a whole.</p>
  <h2>The Three Cs of Civilized Patriotism</h2>
  <p>If we want to promote civilized patriotism in our society, we need to cultivate three essential qualities in ourselves and others:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Compassion - the ability to empathize with the suffering of others and to act on it.</li>
   <li>Critical thinking - the ability to question our own and others' assumptions and beliefs, and to seek evidence-based solutions to problems.</li>
   <li>Courage - the ability to stand up for what is right, even when it is unpopular or risky.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These three Cs are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. They enable us to transcend the narrow boundaries of nationalistic identity and to embrace the broader values of human dignity, respect, and solidarity.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, patriotism is a double-edged sword that can cut both ways, depending on how we wield it. Patriotism, if it is guided by the principles of compassion, critical thinking, and courage, can be a constructive force that serves the common good.</p>
  <p>However, blind patriotism, if it is allowed to run unchecked and unquestioned, can be a destructive force that harms both the nation and the world.</p>
  <p>It is up to us, as individuals and as a society, to choose which way we want to go. We can either fall into the trap of blind patriotism and become a part of the problem, or we can embrace the spirit of civilized patriotism and become a part of the solution. The choice is ours.</p>
