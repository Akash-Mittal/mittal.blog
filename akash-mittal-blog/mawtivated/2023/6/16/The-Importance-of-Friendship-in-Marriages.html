   <p>An inspiring story:</p>
   <p>Once upon a time, there was a couple who were deeply in love with each other. They had everything that they could want - a beautiful home, successful careers, and loving families. But despite all of these blessings, they felt something was missing.</p>
   <p>They realized that they had lost the friendship that they once had. They had become so busy with their individual lives that they forgot to make time for each other. They decided to take a break from their routine and rekindle their friendship by going on a trip together. During their trip, they laughed and talked like they used to. They rediscovered each other and the love that they once shared.</p>

   <h2>The Importance of Friendship in Marriages</h2>
   <p>Friendship is the foundation of any good relationship, especially marriages. Couples who are friends with each other, value each other's happiness, and work together towards common goals are more likely to have successful marriages. A strong friendship can help couples to communicate better, resolve conflicts, and support each other during tough times.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Friendship in Marriages</h2>
   <p>Some couples may view friendship as a less important aspect of their relationship. They focus more on their physical attraction to each other, romantic gestures, and grand gestures of love. However, these things cannot sustain a relationship in the long run. Friendship is not just about being there for each other during tough times. It is about sharing experiences, building memories, and enjoying life together.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Couples who have a shared interest, such as hiking or cooking, are more likely to have a strong friendship. They can bond over their shared passion and create new experiences together.</li>
    <li>Couples who are friends with each other's friends and families tend to have a stronger social network. They can rely on their partner's friends and family for support, advice, and guidance.</li>
    <li>Couples who have a good sense of humor can make each other laugh and share a joyful life together.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Friendship can also help to sustain a marriage during tough times. When a couple is going through a difficult period, such as a job loss, a health issue, or a family crisis, their friendship can help them to stay connected and support each other. By relying on their friendship, they can navigate through these tough times and emerge stronger together.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <div class="conclusion">
    <p>Friendship is the foundation of any good marriage. By prioritizing our friendship with our partners, we can build a strong relationship that can survive the ups and downs of life. Here are three practical tips to strengthen your friendship with your partner:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Make time for each other. Dedicate a regular date night or activity that you both enjoy and make it a priority in your schedule.</li>
     <li>Communicate openly and honestly. Share your thoughts, feelings, and experiences with your partner. Listen to them and show them that you value their opinion.</li>
     <li>Be supportive. Offer your help and guidance when your partner needs it. Celebrate their successes and comfort them during their failures.</li>
    </ol>
