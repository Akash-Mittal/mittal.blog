  <h1>Why Computers Are Useful But Not Always The Answer</h1></br> <img src="images/Why-Computers-Are-Useful-But-Not-Always-The-Answer.jpeg" alt="+Why-Computers-Are-Useful-But-Not-Always-The-Answer+"></br>
  <p>As Pablo Picasso once said, "Computers are useless. They can only give you answers." But are they really?</p>
  <p>Let me share with you a story:</p>
  <p>One day, I was working with a client who had a complex problem in their business. They had already consulted with several computer programs to solve their issue, but to no avail. After hours of trying to figure out the solution, we decided to take a step back and approach it from a different angle. We brainstormed and came up with a creative solution that was not available in any of the computer programs. It ended up being a huge success!</p>
  <p>So, while computers are great tools that can provide us with instant answers, they cannot replace our problem-solving abilities, creativity, and critical thinking skills.</p>
  <h2>Pablo Picasso and His Perspective</h2>
  <p>Pablo Picasso was a renowned artist known for his creativity and unique perspective. He believed in the power of human imagination and innovation. Picasso was not a fan of computers because he believed they were mechanical tools that could not replicate the creativity of human beings.</p>
  <p>While computers are efficient and able to process vast amounts of data quickly, they lack the creativity and innovation that human beings possess. Computers are programmed to do specific tasks, whereas human beings can come up with unique solutions to complex problems.</p>
  <h2>Examples of When Computers Fall Short</h2>
  <p>There are numerous examples of when computers fall short in solving complex problems. Here are just a few:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>A computer program cannot replicate the creativity of an author who comes up with an original storyline or character.</li>
   <li>A computer program cannot provide personalized customer service like human representatives can.</li>
   <li>A computer program cannot come up with an innovative solution to a problem that has not been encountered before.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Why We Still Need Computers</h2>
  <p>Despite the limitations of computers, they are still incredibly useful tools that have changed our lives in many ways. Here are a few reasons why we still need computers:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>They can process vast amounts of data quickly and accurately.</li>
   <li>They have made communication and information sharing easier and more efficient.</li>
   <li>They have revolutionized the way we work, making many jobs easier and more productive.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>While computers are useful tools that have greatly enhanced our lives, they are not always the best answer. We must remember to use our own creativity, problem-solving abilities, and critical thinking skills to supplement what computers can do. Here are three key takeaways:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Computers are not wondrous problem-solving machines; they are limited by what they are programmed to do.</li>
   <li>Human beings have unique problem-solving skills that can supplement what computers can do.</li>
   <li>We must remember to think creatively and approach problems from different angles in order to come up with innovative solutions.</li>
  </ol>
