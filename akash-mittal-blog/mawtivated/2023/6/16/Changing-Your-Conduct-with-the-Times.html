  <h1>The Power of Changing Your Conduct with the Times</h1></br> <img src="images/Changing-Your-Conduct-with-the-Times.jpeg" alt="+Changing-Your-Conduct-with-the-Times+"></br>
  <p>When you look at successful people, you may think that they became successful overnight, but that is never the case. Success requires constant effort and adaptation to changes in the world. It's the ability to keep reinventing yourself that allows you to stay relevant in an ever-changing world. In the words of Niccolo Machiavelli, "Whosoever desires constant success must change his conduct with the times."</p>
  <h2>The Story of Michael Jordan</h2>
  <p>One great example of the importance of changing your conduct is Michael Jordan. We all know Michael Jordan as one of the greatest basketball players in history. He won six championships between 1991 and 1998 and is considered the greatest player of all time. However, what most people do not know is that he failed many times before finding success.</p>
  <p>When Michael Jordan was in high school, he did not make the varsity team. Instead, he played in the junior varsity team. That failure did not deter him. He improved his game tirelessly, and his work paid off. He eventually made the varsity team and went on to have a successful college career.</p>
  <p>But his success did not end there. He continued to work hard and adapt to changes in the game. When he entered the NBA, he was not the great player we know today. He struggled to make a name for himself in the league. However, his tireless work ethic paid off, and he won his first championship in 1991.</p>
  <p>But he didn't stop there. He continued to adapt to changes in the game and became even better. With six championships under his belt, Michael Jordan is a great example of the importance of changing your conduct with the times.</p>
  <h2>Author - Niccolo Machiavelli Story</h2>
  <p>Niccolo Machiavelli was an Italian diplomat, philosopher, and writer who lived during the Renaissance. He was born in 1469 in Florence, Italy. He was a political adviser to the rulers of Florence and wrote extensively about politics and power. His most famous work is The Prince, in which he discusses how rulers should gain and maintain power.</p>
  <p>The quote "Whosoever desires constant success must change his conduct with the times" is just one of the many pearls of wisdom that can be found in Machiavelli's works. His ideas about the importance of adaptation and change are more relevant today than they ever were.</p>
