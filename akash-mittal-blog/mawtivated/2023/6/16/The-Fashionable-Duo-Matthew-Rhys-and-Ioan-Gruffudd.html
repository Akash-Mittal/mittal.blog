  <p>It's not often that we hear about male celebrities who are passionate about their fashion choices. However, Matthew Rhys and Ioan Gruffudd, two Welsh actors, have made a statement with their contrasting styles.</p>
  <h2>The Fashionable Friendship</h2>
  <p>Matthew Rhys and Ioan Gruffudd have been friends for years, and their friendship is based on more than just their love for acting. They both share a passion for fashion, although they have very different tastes.</p>
  <blockquote>
   Me and my friend Ioan Gruffudd are like chalk and cheese when it comes to clothes. - Matthew Rhys
  </blockquote>
  <p>Ioan Gruffudd is known for his impeccable sense of style and has an extensive wardrobe to prove it. He's a fan of designer labels and has a collection of suits that would make any fashion enthusiast envious.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, Matthew Rhys is more laid-back and practical when it comes to his fashion choices. He's not afraid to wear the same outfit twice and is often seen in casual attire.</p>
  <p>Despite their different styles, the two actors often collaborate and help each other out when it comes to fashion emergencies.</p>
  <blockquote>
   If we're going out I'll turn up at his house and say, 'I haven't got anything to wear,' and he'll tut and sigh and then lend me something swanky. - Matthew Rhys
  </blockquote>

  <p>For example, he's been spotted in a casual outfit consisting of a denim jacket, plain t-shirt, and jeans, but he also added a stylish leather backpack to give the look an edge.</p>
