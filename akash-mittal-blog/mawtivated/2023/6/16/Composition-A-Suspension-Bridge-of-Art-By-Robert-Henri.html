    <h3 style="text-align: center;">An Inspiring Story</h3>
    <p>It was a crisp autumn morning when Robert Henri, the celebrated American painter, set out to capture the beauty of his favorite bridge in New York City. As he walked along the shores of the East River, he felt a strong desire to create something that would not only reflect the majesty of the bridge but also convey the idea of strength and stability.</p>
    <p>As he stood there, gazing at the bridge and sketching his ideas, he realized that the structure of the bridge was like a perfect composition. Each line contributed to the whole, adding strength and balance, without taking anything away. This realization sparked a new way of thinking about his art, and he began to apply the principles of composition in all his work.</p>
    <p>The suspension bridge had become a metaphor for his art - a symbol of his belief that good composition was like a suspension bridge, and each line was like a cable, adding strength and taking none away.</p>

    <h3>Examples of Good Composition</h3>
    <ol>
     <li><strong>Balance:</strong> A good composition has balance, which means that all the elements in the artwork are in harmonious proportion. For example, a painting of a landscape might have a tree on one side and a lake on the other, effectively creating a sense of balance.</li>
     <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> A good composition has contrast, which means that there is a difference between the elements. For example, a black and white photograph might have a stark contrast between the light and dark areas, creating a sense of drama.</li>
     <li><strong>Unity:</strong> A good composition has unity, which means that all the elements are working together to create a cohesive whole. For example, a painting of a still life might have several different objects, but they are arranged in a way that creates a sense of unity.</li>
