   <h2>My Mom is Not Trying to Live Vicariously Through Me</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>Growing up, I always felt like my mother had high expectations for me. She wanted me to excel academically, participate in extracurricular activities, and be the best at everything I did. At times, it felt like she was living her life through me and that I was never good enough. However, as I got older and began to understand her better, I realized that my mom was not trying to live vicariously through me. Instead, she was pushing me to be my best self and to reach my full potential.</p>
   <p>Through our conversations and my own personal growth, I learned that it's important to live our own lives and not worry about the expectations of others. While it's great to have people who support and encourage us, it's also important to remember that our lives belong to us and we are the ones who get to decide how we want to live them.</p>
   <p>A great example of this is the actress and singer Victoria Justice. She got her start on Nickelodeon and has since gone on to have a successful career in Hollywood. However, she has also been open about the pressures she's faced in the industry to live up to certain standards and expectations.</p>
   <p>Despite this, she has remained true to herself and has pursued roles and projects that reflect her values and interests. In an interview with <em>Glamour</em> magazine, she said, "I've learned to really trust my gut and my instincts. And I'm okay with saying no to things that don't feel right."</p>
   <p>This is an important lesson for all of us to learn. We need to trust ourselves and our instincts and not let others dictate how we should live our lives. While it can be difficult to say no to things that don't feel right, it's important to remember that our happiness and well-being are worth it.</p>
   <h2>3 Practical Tips for Living Your Own Life</h2>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>Get to know yourself.</strong> Take the time to reflect on your values, interests, and goals. What makes you happy? What drives you? What do you want to achieve in life? Once you have a better understanding of yourself, you can start making decisions that align with who you are.</li>
    <li><strong>Set boundaries.</strong> It's important to communicate your needs and establish boundaries with those around you. Let people know what you're comfortable with and what you're not. This can include saying no to things that don't feel right or asking for help and support when you need it.</li>
    <li><strong>Stay true to yourself.</strong> Don't let others dictate your life or make you feel like you have to live up to certain standards or expectations. Trust yourself and your instincts and pursue the things that make you happy and fulfilled.</li>
   </ol>
