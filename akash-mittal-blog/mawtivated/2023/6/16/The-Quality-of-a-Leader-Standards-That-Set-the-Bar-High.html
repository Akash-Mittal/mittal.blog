   <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
   <p>It was a hot summer day in August, and a group of people had gathered outside a new restaurant in San Bernardino, California, eagerly awaiting to taste the food that was being offered. Among them was a man named Ray Kroc, who had heard about this restaurant from a lucrative deal to supply milkshake machines to them. As soon as he tasted the food, he knew it was something special, something that could be scaled and replicated to make a fortune.</p>
   <p>And that's what he did. Ray Kroc went on to purchase the restaurant chain, which was called McDonald's, and turned it into a global empire that is now worth billions of dollars. How did he do it? One of the main reasons was his unwavering commitment to high standards, not just for the food and the service that was being offered, but for himself as well.</p>
   <h2>The Importance of Self-Set Standards</h2>
   <p>As the old saying goes, "actions speak louder than words." This is particularly true when it comes to leadership. A leader who sets high standards for themselves is more likely to inspire others to do the same. When employees see that their boss is willing to put in the effort to achieve a certain level of excellence, they are more likely to follow suit.</p>
   <p>Setting high standards for oneself also sends a message of integrity and self-discipline. It demonstrates that a leader is not just talking about values like hard work, commitment, and excellence - they are embodying them.</p>
   <h3> and Case Studies</h3>
   <p>One example of a leader who was known for his high standards was Steve Jobs, the co-founder and CEO of Apple. Jobs was notorious for his attention to detail, often spending hours poring over the design of a single product. He was also known for his demanding and sometimes abrasive leadership style, but this didn't stop his employees from striving for excellence.</p>
   <p>Another example is Indra Nooyi, the former CEO of PepsiCo. In an interview with Harvard Business Review, she spoke about how she sets high standards for herself by taking on challenges that are outside of her comfort zone. For example, she decided to learn to play the guitar as an adult, even though she had no previous musical experience. By pushing herself in this way, she demonstrated to her employees that it's important to be willing to take risks and try new things.</p>
   <h2>Practical Tips</h2>

   </ul>
