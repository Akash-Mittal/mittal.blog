    <h2 id="story">Story</h2>
    <p>There's something undeniably powerful about making unexpected friendships. They can change the course of our lives, lead us down new paths, and challenge our assumptions about the world around us.</p>
    <p>That's exactly what happened to me when I spent some time volunteering on Skid Row, one of the most impoverished and marginalized communities in the United States. At first, I approached the experience with trepidation and a little bit of fear. What could I possibly have in common with the people who lived there?</p>
    <p>But as I got to know the people who called Skid Row home, I began to see their resilience, their strength, and their humanity. I heard their stories, their struggles, and their dreams. And I found myself making friends with people I might never have crossed paths with otherwise.</p>
    <blockquote>
     When I was leaving I kind of felt a little bit sad, because I made some friends down in skid row.
    </blockquote>
    <p>As I walked away from Skid Row that day, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the unexpected friendships I had made. They reminded me of the power of community, the importance of kindness and compassion, and the beauty of connection.</p>
    <h2>Author Background - Pras Michel</h2>
    <p>My name is Pras Michel, and I'm a musician, filmmaker, and social entrepreneur. I'm perhaps best known as a founding member of the hip-hop group The Fugees, but my career has taken me on a wide variety of journeys. Along the way, I've discovered the power of creativity, community, and connection to make a difference in the world. Whether it's through my work with my non-profit organization, the Hope for Haiti Foundation, or my efforts to bring attention to important social issues through my music and films, I'm committed to using my platform for good.</p>
    <h2 id="tips">Tips for Making Unexpected Friendships</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>Listen. Really listen to the stories and experiences of the people around you. Listen with an open mind and heart, and be willing to learn from the people you meet.</li>
     <li>Be curious. Ask questions. Be genuinely interested in the people you meet, and seek to understand where they're coming from.</li>
     <li>Be vulnerable. Share your own experiences, your own fears and dreams. By being vulnerable, you create a space for others to do the same.</li>
     <li>Be respectful. Remember that everyone deserves dignity and respect, no matter their background or circumstances.</li>
     <li>Be persistent. Friendships take time and effort to develop. Keep showing up, keep reaching out, and keep investing in the people you meet.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Unexpected friendships can enrich our lives in ways we never could have anticipated. They can challenge our assumptions, broaden our horizons, and remind us of the power of connection. By listening, being curious, practicing vulnerability, showing respect, and persisting over time, we can build bridges between ourselves and others, no matter how different our paths may seem.</p>
