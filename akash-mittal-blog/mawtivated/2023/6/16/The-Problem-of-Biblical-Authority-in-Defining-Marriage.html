   <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
   <p>Samantha and Sarah had been together for 5 years and had recently gotten engaged. They were overjoyed and could not wait to get married. However, some family members and friends questioned their marriage, citing their religious beliefs. Despite the opposition, Samantha and Sarah knew that their love was true and they persisted in planning their wedding. On their wedding day, they exchanged vows, surrounded by loved ones who supported them. As they kissed, they knew that their love had triumphed over any religious objections.</p>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>Author Jon Meacham, in his book 'American Gospel: God, The Founding Fathers, and The Making of a Nation,' writes that while the Bible is a foundational text for many Christians, interpreting it can often be challenging. Those who argue against same-sex marriage using biblical authority often fail to acknowledge the nuanced nature of biblical interpretation.</p>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>The problem for those who assert biblical authority in support of traditional definitions of marriage is that one could, with equal validity, assert that the lending of money or certain kinds of haircuts are forbidden by God, or that slavery and the subjugation of women are authorized by the Lord.</p>
    <p>What this means is that biblical interpretation is often a complex and subjective matter. While some Christians may interpret the Bible in a way that leads them to reject same-sex marriage, others may interpret it in a way that affirms it.</p>

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <ul>
     <li>In the Book of Leviticus, there are passages that seem to forbid homosexuality. However, this is within the context of a broader set of purity laws that are often not followed.</li>
     <li>Elsewhere in the Bible, there are examples of what might seem to be same-sex relationships that are not condemned, such as the relationship between David and Jonathan.</li>
     <li>Furthermore, some Christian denominations have embraced same-sex marriage, with the United Church of Christ and the Presbyterian Church (USA) among them.</li>
    </ul>
