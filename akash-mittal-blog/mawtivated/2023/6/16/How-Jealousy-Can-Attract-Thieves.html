  <h1>How Jealousy Can Attract Thieves</h1></br> <img src="images/How-Jealousy-Can-Attract-Thieves.jpeg" alt="+How-Jealousy-Can-Attract-Thieves+"></br>
  <p>Jealousy is a powerful emotion that can consume a person's thoughts and actions, leading them down a dangerous path. As Karl Kraus once said, "Jealousy is a dog's bark which attracts thieves", meaning that jealousy often leads to negative outcomes. In this article, we'll explore the dangers of jealousy and how it can attract thieves.</p>
  <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
  <p>There was a young couple named John and Jane who lived in a quiet neighborhood. John was an entrepreneur and always worked long hours to provide for his family. However, Jane became increasingly jealous of John's success and the attention he received from others. She would constantly check his phone, email, and social media accounts to make sure he wasn't talking to other women.</p>
  <p>One day, John came home to find that their house had been burglarized. The thieves had taken all the expensive electronics and jewelry, leaving their home in shambles. As it turned out, Jane had been the one who had inadvertently attracted the thieves. She had been posting pictures of their new purchases and expensive belongings on social media, not realizing that she was giving thieves a window into their home.</p>
  <h2>Karl Kraus Story</h2>
  <p>Karl Kraus was an Austrian journalist, satirist, and playwright known for his witty and critical remarks. He often wrote about the dangers of jealousy and how it can lead to negative outcomes. Kraus himself had experienced jealousy firsthand, as he was often envious of other writers' success.</p>
  <p>In one of his essays, Kraus wrote, "Jealousy is a disease, love is a healthy condition. The immature mind often mistakes one for the other, or assumes that the greater the love, the greater the jealousy." Kraus believed that jealousy was a destructive emotion that could only lead to unhappiness.</p>
  <h2>Examples of How Jealousy Attracts Thieves</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>Posting pictures on social media of expensive belongings that can be seen through windows or doors.</li>
   <li>Constantly checking your partner's phone and email, which can lead to fights and disagreements.</li>
   <li>Displaying jealousy in public, which can attract unwanted attention and make you a target for thieves.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
  <p>I once knew a woman who was extremely jealous of her husband's co-workers. She would always ask him for their phone numbers and email addresses, so she could check to see if he was talking to them outside of work. One day, the woman's husband forgot his phone at home, and she went through his messages. She found messages from one of his co-workers, but they were all work-related. The woman became angry and called the co-worker, accusing her of trying to steal her husband. The co-worker was shocked and felt violated, and their working relationship was never the same again.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Jealousy is a dangerous emotion that can lead to negative outcomes, including attracting thieves. To avoid attracting unwanted attention, it's important to practice self-control and not give into jealousy. Here are three tips to keep in mind:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Avoid posting pictures of expensive belongings on social media</li>
   <li>Communicate openly with your partner, rather than checking their phone or email</li>
   <li>Avoid public displays of jealousy</li>
  </ol>
