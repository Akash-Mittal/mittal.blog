  <h1>The Peculiar Relationship between Reader and Characters</h1></br> <img src="images/The-Peculiar-Relationship-between-Reader-and-Characters.jpeg" alt="+The-Peculiar-Relationship-between-Reader-and-Characters+"></br>
  <p>Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Lily who loved reading books so much that she felt like she was living a thousand lives. She was especially fond of a book called "The Great Gatsby" and its main character, Jay Gatsby. She was fascinated by his charm, his mystery, and his tragic fate.</p>
  <p>Years went by, and Lily grew up to become an English teacher. One day, she assigned "The Great Gatsby" to her students, hoping that they would love it as she did. However, she was disappointed to find that they couldn't relate to Jay Gatsby at all. They found him shallow, selfish, and foolish.</p>
  <p>This experience made Lily realize that the relationship between reader and characters is very difficult. It is even more peculiar than the relationship between the writer and his characters. Here are some reasons why:</p>
  <div class="quote">
   <p>"Characters are not created by the writer. They are simply found by him, in his study of human nature. They are like acquaintances made in real life, whom we do not create, but simply meet." - Guillermo Cabrera Infante</p>
  </div>
  <p>Guillermo Cabrera Infante, a Cuban writer and film critic, understood the mysterious nature of character creation. He believed that characters are not invented by writers, but rather discovered through observation and imagination.</p>
  <p>Indeed, when a writer sets out to create a character, they are not starting from scratch. They are drawing from their own experiences, as well as the people they have encountered in their lives. As a result, characters often take on a life of their own, and readers may perceive them differently than the writer intended.</p>
  <p>Moreover, readers bring their own biases, beliefs, and experiences to the table when they encounter a character. They may project their own desires and fears onto the character, or they may reject the character altogether if they find them unrelatable or unlikable.</p>
  <p>For example, some readers may sympathize with Jay Gatsby's quest for love and wealth, while others may see him as a deluded romantic who is bound to fail. Similarly, some readers may root for Hamlet's revenge against his uncle, while others may see him as a passive and indecisive character.</p>
  <p>Therefore, the relationship between reader and characters requires a delicate balance of interpretation, empathy, and imagination.</p>
  <div class="background">
   <p>Guillermo Cabrera Infante was born in Cuba in 1929 and studied at the University of Havana. He was a member of the Cuban Communist Party and worked as a cultural attach√© in Brussels. However, he became disenchanted with the regime of Fidel Castro and defected to England in 1965. He then lived in Spain and the United States, where he continued to write novels, essays, and screenplays. He died in 2005.</p>

  <h2>Examples of Peculiar Relationships between Reader and Characters</h2>
  <p>Here are some examples of how readers may perceive characters differently:</p>
  <ul class="points">
   <li>Holden Caulfield from "The Catcher in the Rye" may be seen as a rebellious and sensitive teenager by some readers, while others may see him as a whiny and entitled brat.</li>
   <li>Scarlett O'Hara from "Gone with the Wind" may be admired for her courage and resilience by some readers, while others may find her manipulative and selfish.</li>
   <li>Harry Potter from the eponymous series may be loved for his bravery and kindness by some readers, while others may find him a bit too naive and impulsive.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Peculiar Relationships in Real Life</h2>
  <p>In addition to literature, peculiar relationships between observer and observed can also be found in real life. For instance, psychologists have studied the phenomenon of "transference", which refers to the tendency of patients to transfer their emotions and expectations onto their therapists. Similar to readers and characters, patients and therapists must navigate a complex web of projections, assumptions, and interpretations.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, the relationship between reader and characters is a fascinating and intricate one. Here are some key takeaways:</p>
  <ol class="conclusion">
   <li>Characters are not created by writers, but discovered through observation and imagination.</li>
   <li>Readers bring their own biases, beliefs, and experiences to the table when they encounter a character.</li>
   <li>The relationship between reader and characters requires a delicate balance of interpretation, empathy, and imagination.</li>
  </ol>
