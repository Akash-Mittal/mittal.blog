   <h4 style="text-align:center;">An inspiring story</h4>
   <p>Once upon a time, there was a young man named John who was fresh out of college. As he started job hunting, he came across an advertisement for a project manager position. Despite not having any experience in the field, he decided to apply for the job. To his surprise, he was called for an interview and was appointed the project manager.</p>
   <p>John had no idea how he was going to manage the project, but he was determined to prove himself. He started working very hard and spent long hours creating schedules, attending meetings, and monitoring the development of the project. He felt that he was doing a great job, but the project was not progressing as fast as he had expected.</p>
   <p>One day, John's boss came to him and asked him to complete the project two weeks earlier than the original deadline. John was taken aback, but he promised to do his best. He was surprised at how much he had accomplished in the last two weeks of the project. Suddenly, his team started working more efficiently, and everything seemed to fall into place.</p>
   <p>After the project was completed on time, John realized that he had fallen into a common trap. He had allowed the work to expand and fill the time that was available to him. With the new deadline, he got laser-focused and made the most of his time. This experience taught him a valuable lesson that he could apply to every project he managed.</p>
   <h4 style="text-align:center;">Author - C. Northcote Parkinson</h4>
   <p>C. Northcote Parkinson was a British historian and author known for his work on public administration. Parkinson was an advocate of Parkinson's Law, which states that work expands to fill the time available for its completion. Parkinson's Law has been widely quoted, and its principles have been applied to various fields, including management and productivity.</p>
   <h4 style="text-align:center;">Examples</h4>
   <h5>Budgets and Timelines</h5>
   <p>Suppose a company has to plan a marketing campaign for a new product launch. The marketing team meets to create a budget and timeline for the campaign. Just as they finish the budget, someone points out that the timeline would need to be adjusted. They realize that they forgot to include a crucial step in their planning and need to add it to their timeline. The team adjusts the timeline and realizes that they pushed back the end date by two weeks. Everyone realizes that they have much more work to accomplish before the new deadline. As a result, the team starts working more efficiently and effectively to get the campaign on track to meet the new deadline.</p>
   <h5>Project Management</h5>
   <p>Suppose a project manager is working on an online store project and needs to launch the store in two months. The project manager creates a schedule that includes every necessary milestone to complete the project and meet the deadline. Just as the project manager begins working on the project, they receive an email from their boss stating that the deadline has been adjusted. The project manager adjusts their schedule according to the new timeline and realizes that they must move much faster to achieve the new deadline. As a result, the project manager and their team work more efficiently and effectively to ensure the project's timely completion.</p>
   <h4 style="text-align:center;">Conclusion</h4>
