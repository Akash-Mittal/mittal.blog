   <h2>An Inspiring Story of Personal Freedom</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>It wasn't always like this. I used to be one of those people who believed that government was the solution to all our problems. I was convinced that if only we had the right leaders in place, they could fix everything.</p>
   <p>Then I had an experience that changed my mind.</p>
   <p>I was living in a foreign country at the time. One day, I woke up to find that my apartment had been robbed. The thieves had taken just about everything of value, including my cash, my computer, and my passport.</p>
   <p>I was devastated. I didn't know what to do. I was in a foreign country with no money and no identification. I was sure that the government would step in and help me out. After all, wasn't that their job?</p>
   <p>But no help came. I went to the local police station and was told that there was nothing they could do. I went to the American embassy, and they gave me some advice, but no real assistance. I was on my own.</p>
   <p>At first, I was angry. How could they abandon me like this? But then something amazing happened. I realized that I had to rely on myself. I had to find my own solutions. And you know what? I did. I found ways to get money. I found ways to get a new passport. I found ways to survive.</p>
   <p>And that's when it hit me: I don't need the government to take care of me. I can take care of myself.</p>
   <p>That's why I love a government that leaves me alone. Because it lets me be independent. It lets me be free.</p>
   <h3>Author - John Updike</h3>
   <p>If anyone knew about the importance of personal freedom, it was John Updike. He was a writer who lived and worked during a time when many people were questioning their own beliefs about government and society.</p>
   <p>Updike was a critic of big government. He believed that the best government was one that allowed people to pursue their own interests without interference. He once wrote, "The ideal of an individualistic society has been part of our national heritage since the founding of the republic, and it is an ideal we must never lose sight of."</p>
   <p>Updike's words still ring true today. We need to remember that the government is not always the answer. Sometimes, we need to rely on ourselves to solve our own problems.</p>
   <h2>Examples of a Government That Leaves People Alone</h2>

    <li>A government that allows people to make their own choices.</li>
