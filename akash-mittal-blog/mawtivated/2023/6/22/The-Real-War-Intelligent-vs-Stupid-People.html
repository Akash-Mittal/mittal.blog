  <h1>The Real War: Intelligent vs Stupid People</h1></br> <img src="images/The-Real-War-Intelligent-vs-Stupid-People.jpeg" alt="+The-Real-War-Intelligent-vs-Stupid-People+"></br>
  <p>Have you ever wondered why there is so much conflict in the world? Why do people fight over land, resources, religion, and politics? The answer is simple, but profound. The real war is not between the West and the East. The real war is between intelligent and stupid people.</p>
  <p>Let me tell you a story. There was a man who lived in a small village in Africa. He was a farmer who owned a small plot of land where he grew crops to feed his family and sell at the local market. One day, a group of armed men from a neighboring village came to his farm, destroyed his crops, and threatened to kill him if he did not give them his land. The man was terrified, but he refused to give up his land. He knew that if he did, he would lose his livelihood and his dignity.</p>
  <p>After the men left, the man decided to seek help from the neighboring village. He walked for hours to reach the village, and when he finally arrived, he told his story to the chief. The chief listened to him with compassion and promised to help him. The chief summoned the men from the neighboring village and asked them to explain why they had attacked the man's farm. The men had no valid reason, and the chief scolded them for their stupidity and ignorance. The chief then ordered them to compensate the man for his losses and to never harm him again. The man returned to his farm with a renewed sense of hope and gratitude.</p>
  <p>This story illustrates the importance of intelligence, courage, and compassion in resolving conflicts. The man in the story refused to give up his land not because he was stubborn, but because he knew that his land was his only source of food and income. He was intelligent enough to understand the value of his land and the consequences of losing it. The chief in the neighboring village was also intelligent, but he was also compassionate. He understood the man's plight and was willing to help him. He was brave enough to confront the men from the neighboring village and to demand justice. The men who attacked the man's farm were stupid and ignorant. They had no valid reason to do so, and they had no respect for the man's rights or dignity.</p>
  <h2>Author's Background</h2>
  <p>Marjane Satrapi is an Iranian graphic novelist, cartoonist, and filmmaker who is best known for her memoir, "Persepolis," which tells the story of her childhood and adolescence in Iran during and after the Islamic Revolution. Satrapi was born in 1969 in Tehran, Iran, and was raised in a politically active family. Her parents were Marxists who fought against the Iranian monarchy, and her uncle was a member of the Islamist revolutionaries who overthrew the monarchy in 1979. Satrapi was interested in art and literature from a young age, and she began making comics when she was just 10 years old. She studied visual communication at the University of Tehran and later moved to France to pursue her career as an artist. "Persepolis" was published in 2000 and was later adapted into an animated film that was nominated for an Academy Award. Satrapi's work explores themes such as identity, politics, and human rights, and she is considered one of the most influential and important graphic novelists of our time.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Intelligent vs Stupid People</h2>
  <p>Examples of intelligent people are those who are able to think critically, solve problems, and make informed decisions based on evidence and reason. They are open-minded, curious, and willing to learn from other people and cultures. They are also empathetic and compassionate, and they care about the well-being of others. Examples of stupid people are those who are closed-minded, ignorant, and unwilling to consider other perspectives. They are driven by fear, hatred, and prejudice, and they are often violent and aggressive towards those who are different from them. They are also selfish and greedy, and they care only about their own interests and desires.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>An example of an intelligent person is Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistani activist for female education who was shot by the Taliban in 2012. Malala was targeted by the Taliban because she spoke out against their ban on girls' education. Instead of giving up, Malala became even more determined to fight for her right to education and to help other girls do the same. She continues to be an inspiration and a role model for people around the world who believe in the power of education and social justice.</li>
   <li>An example of a stupid person is Adolf Hitler, the leader of Nazi Germany who orchestrated the genocide of 6 million Jews during World War II. Hitler was motivated by his hatred of Jews and his desire for power and domination. He was a skilled orator who was able to manipulate the fears and prejudices of his followers to achieve his goals. His legacy serves as a warning of the dangers of racism, fascism, and totalitarianism.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These examples illustrate the stark contrast between intelligent and stupid people and the impact they can have on the world. It is up to us to choose which path we want to follow.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
