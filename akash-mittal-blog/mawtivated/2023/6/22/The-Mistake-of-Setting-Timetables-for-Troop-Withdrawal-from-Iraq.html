    <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
    <p>When a small village in Iraq was liberated from the grips of ISIS, the people rejoiced. However, it wasn't until American soldiers returned to the village some time later that they truly understood the impact their actions had. The village elder thanked them for their service and then said something that stuck with the soldiers: "You gave us our freedom, but you also gave us hope."</p>
    <p>This story highlights the importance and complexity of the situation in Iraq. While American troops have accomplished much in the fight against terrorism, there is still much work to be done to ensure lasting peace and stability in the region.</p>

    <h2>Author - Nick Clooney Story or Background</h2>
    <p>Nick Clooney is a journalist and human rights activist, known for his work in countries like Sudan and Syria. He has been an outspoken critic of the war in Iraq and advocates for a more peaceful approach to diplomacy and conflict resolution.</p>
    <p>Clooney's experience in these regions has taught him that there are no easy solutions when it comes to war and conflict, and that setting timetables for troop withdrawal can often do more harm than good.</p>

    <h2>The Myth of Timetables</h2>
    <p>Conventional wisdom holds that setting a timetable for getting American troops out of Iraq would be a mistake. This belief is based on the idea that it will signal weakness to our enemies, undermine our efforts to stabilize the region, and ultimately lead to more violence and instability.</p>
    <p>However, the reality is that timetables are often necessary to push for progress in negotiations and to ensure accountability on the part of all parties involved. Without deadlines, there is no sense of urgency to make the difficult decisions that peace requires.</p>
    <p>In addition, timetables can actually help to build trust and promote long-term stability by showing a commitment to a peaceful resolution. They can also help to reduce the human and financial costs of war by setting clear goals and objectives for all parties involved.</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>"Without deadlines, there is no sense of urgency to make the difficult decisions that peace requires."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Of course, timetables must be approached with caution and flexibility. They should be realistic and take into account the complex political and social dynamics in the region. They should also be open to negotiation and adjustment as circumstances change.</p>
