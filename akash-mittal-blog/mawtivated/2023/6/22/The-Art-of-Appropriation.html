    <h3>Inspiring Story</h3>
    <p>There was once an artist named Banksy who made a name for himself by creating provocative and thought-provoking works of art in public spaces. One of his most famous works was a mural depicting two police officers kissing, which originally appeared on a wall in Brighton, England.</p>
    <p>However, one day the mural was removed from the wall and put up for auction at a prestigious art gallery. Banksy was livid - he had created the piece for the public, not for someone to profit off of it. So, he decided to take matters into his own hands. He went to the auction disguised as a bidder and, when the mural went up for sale, he activated a remote-controlled shredder hidden inside the frame, destroying the artwork in front of a stunned audience. The moment went viral, and Banksy's message about the commodification of art was heard loud and clear.</p>
    <p>This story is a perfect example of the tensions that can arise in the art world due to issues of originality, ownership, and appropriation. However, it's also a testament to the power of art to start important conversations and challenge the status quo.</p>

    <h3>Author - Jerry Saltz Story or Background</h3>
    <div>
     <p>Jerry Saltz is one of the most respected art critics and writers in the world. He has been the senior art critic for New York Magazine since 2006, and has won numerous awards for his writing. However, before he became a critic, Saltz was an artist himself.</p>
     <p>After graduating from art school, Saltz moved to Chicago and became part of the city's burgeoning art scene. However, he struggled to make ends meet, working odd jobs and selling his paintings for very little money. Eventually, he decided to move to New York City, hoping to make a name for himself in the art world. He worked as a long-distance trucker and a security guard while attending openings and meeting other artists. Finally, in 1998, he got his big break when he was hired as a critic for The Village Voice.</p>
     <p>Since then, Saltz has become known for his sharp wit, insightful commentary, and willingness to challenge the status quo in the art world. He's not afraid to call out artists or institutions for their shortcomings, but he also celebrates those who are truly pushing boundaries and making a difference. His voice is an important one in a world that can sometimes be insular and exclusive.</p>

    <h3>What is Appropriation?</h3>
    <p>As the opening quote suggests, appropriation is a common technique in contemporary art. But what exactly does it mean?</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Appropriation is the act of taking pre-existing images or objects, and using them to create something new.</li>
     <li>It can involve repurposing found materials, sampling from pop culture, or even copying directly from other artworks.</li>
     <li>Some artists use appropriation as a way to subvert or critique dominant cultural narratives, while others simply see it as a way to avoid the pressure of originality.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, regardless of the motivation behind it, appropriation has become a ubiquitous trend in the art world. From Jeff Koons' sculptures made from inflatable toys, to Sherrie Levine's photographs of other photographers' work, to Damien Hirst's pill cabinets, artists are constantly borrowing from the world around them to create something new and provocative.</p>

    <h3>Examples of Appropriation in Action</h3>
    <p>Here are just a few examples of how artists have used appropriation in their work:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Andy Warhol's silk-screened images of Marilyn Monroe and other celebrities, which were based on publicity stills from movies and magazines.</li>
     <li>Barbara Kruger's powerful and arresting text-and-image collages, which often incorporated slogans from advertising and mass media.</li>
     <li>Yinka Shonibare's sculptures, which appropriate the visual language of colonialism and empire to explore themes of identity and power.</li>
     <li>Cindy Sherman's photographs, which feature the artist herself dressed up in various costumes and playing different characters.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These artists and many others have used appropriation in innovative and transformative ways, pushing the boundaries of what art can be and do in the world.</p>

    <h3>Personal Anecdote</h3>
    <p>As an art lover and critic, I've seen countless examples of appropriation in galleries and museums around the world. However, one piece that stands out in my mind is Richard Prince's "Untitled (Cowboy)" series. In these works, Prince appropriated images of cowboys from Marlboro cigarette ads and presented them as large-scale, high-gloss photographs. The images are visually stunning, but they also raise important questions about masculinity, advertising, and American culture.</p>
    <p>However, what struck me most about these works was the controversy they sparked. Some critics accused Prince of simply stealing from the Marlboro ads and profiting off of someone else's work. Others saw the series as a powerful critique of the tobacco industry and its blatant manipulation of American ideals.</p>
    <p>For me, the "Untitled (Cowboy)" series was a perfect example of how appropriation can be both beautiful and problematic, depending on one's perspective and interpretation. It's a reminder that art is never just about aesthetics - it's always rooted in context, history, and meaning.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>After examining the concept of appropriation and exploring some examples of how it's been used in the art world, we can draw a few conclusions. Here are three key takeaways:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Appropriation is a complex and multifaceted technique that can be used to both powerful and troubling effect.</li>
     <li>Artists who appropriate from other sources must be mindful of issues of originality and ownership, and should be prepared to defend their choices.</li>
     <li>As viewers, we should approach appropriation with an open mind and a critical eye, considering the ways in which it challenges and shapes our understanding of the world.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Ultimately, the art of appropriation is a testament to the human capacity for creativity, innovation, and reinvention. It reminds us that even in a world filled with images, ideas, and objects, there is always something new to discover and explore.</p>
