    <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
    <p>There is a story about a man who has been searching for the solution to a big problem for years. He has tried everything he could, but nothing seems to work. One day, he met a wise old man who told him, "Don't get involved in partial problems, but always take flight to where there is a free view over the whole single great problem, even if this view is still not a clear one."</p>
    <p>The man was puzzled by this advice, but he followed it nonetheless. He started looking at the problem from a different perspective, and a solution slowly emerged. It wasn't easy, but with perseverance and a willingness to step back and view the problem from a different angle, he eventually found the answer he had been looking for.</p>

    <h2>Background of Ludwig Wittgenstein</h2>
    <p>Ludwig Wittgenstein was an Austrian-British philosopher who is regarded as one of the most important and influential thinkers of the 20th century. He was born in Vienna in 1889 and studied engineering before turning to philosophy. He is best known for his two major works, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus and Philosophical Investigations.</p>
    <p>Wittgenstein believed that language was at the heart of philosophical problems. He argued that many of the problems that philosophers had grappled with for centuries were in fact due to misunderstandings of language. He believed that the job of the philosopher was to clarify the use of language and to look at language games, or the contexts in which we use language.</p>

    <blockquote>
     "The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them." - Albert Einstein
    </blockquote>
    <p>To find solutions to big problems, we need to take a step back and look at the problem from a different perspective. This may mean putting aside our preconceived notions and biases and trying to understand the problem as objectively as possible. It may also mean looking at the problem in the context of larger systems and networks, rather than trying to solve it in isolation.</p>

    <p>When I was working on a project to reduce plastic waste in our community, I realized that we needed to look beyond just recycling. We needed to address the entire lifecycle of plastic and find ways to reduce our consumption from the start. By taking a step back and looking at the problem holistically, we were able to come up with a more comprehensive and effective solution.</p>
    <p>Another example is a case study of a company that was struggling with declining sales. They tried everything they could think of, from cutting costs to changing their marketing strategy, but nothing seemed to work. Finally, they realized that the root of the problem was a shift in the market that they had failed to anticipate. By looking at the problem from a wider perspective and understanding the larger trends in their industry, they were able to adjust their approach and turn their business around.</p>
