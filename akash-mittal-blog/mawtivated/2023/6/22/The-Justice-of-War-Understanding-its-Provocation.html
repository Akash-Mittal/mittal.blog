   <h2>A Compelling Story of Justice Waged in War</h2>
   <p>A long time ago, in a faraway land, there was a kingdom that was ruled by a wise and just king. However, one day, an enemy kingdom invaded the land and started a war with the kingdom. The enemy kingdom had no reason nor provocation for their attack except for their greed for power and wealth. The war went on for years, with the enemy kingdom wreaking havoc and causing destruction on the kingdom. The king, in his righteous anger, rallied his people to defend their land and their freedom. After a long and grueling battle, the kingdom was victorious and peace was restored. The king, in his final speech, declared that the war they had waged was not only for their own defense, but also for the defense of justice and morality. And thus, the kingdom continued to prosper under the reign of a just and righteous king.</p>
   <blockquote>
    "Those wars are unjust which are undertaken without provocation. For only a war waged for revenge or defense can be just." - Marcus Tullius Cicero
   </blockquote>
   <h2>The Thoughts of Marcus Tullius Cicero</h2>
   <p>Marcus Tullius Cicero was a Roman statesman, orator, and philosopher who lived in the years 106 BC to 43 BC. He was a well-known defender of the Roman Republic and its ideals, including justice and morality. Cicero believed that wars were only justifiable if they were waged for revenge or defense, and that wars without provocation were inherently unjust. This belief was rooted in his understanding of the principles of justice and morality, which held that any action that was not provoked or justified by a good cause was immoral and unjust.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Wars Waged with and without Provocation</h2>
   <p>Throughout history, there have been countless wars that were waged for a variety of reasons, including revenge, defense, and greed. Some wars were clearly justifiable, while others were not. Here are some examples:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The American Revolution was a war that was waged for the cause of freedom and justice. The American colonists were tired of being oppressed by the British Empire, and thus fought for their rights to independence.</li>
    <li>World War II was a war that was waged for the defense of humanity and morality. The Allied powers, led by the United States, fought against the Axis powers, led by Nazi Germany, to prevent the spread of fascism and genocide.</li>
    <li>The Gulf War was a war that was waged for oil and the preservation of the global economy. The United States led a coalition of countries to fight against Iraq, which had invaded Kuwait, and thus threatened the stability of the oil market.</li>
    <li>The Vietnam War was a war that was waged for no clear reason or provocation. The United States sent troops to Vietnam to prevent the spread of communism, but the reasons behind the war were murky and controversial, leading to significant protests and loss of life.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>Ultimately, the justifiability of a war depends on its provocation. Only a war waged for revenge or defense can be just, according to Marcus Tullius Cicero. Wars that are waged without provocation, whether it be for greed or imperialism, are inherently unjust and immoral. Therefore, it is important for individuals and nations to carefully consider the reasons behind a war before engaging in one. By doing so, we can ensure that our actions are justified and rooted in the principles of justice and morality.</p>
   <p>To summarize, the key takeaways from this article are:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Wars waged without provocation are unjust and immoral, according to Marcus Tullius Cicero.</li>
    <li>Examples of justifiable wars include those waged for revenge or defense, such as the American Revolution and World War II.</li>
    <li>Examples of unjustifiable wars include those waged for greed or imperialism, such as the Gulf War and the Vietnam War.</li>
   </ul>
