   <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>Once upon a time, there was a man named John who believed that he had the ultimate truth. He was so confident in his beliefs that he would argue with anyone who didn't agree with him.</p>
   <p>One day, John met a wise old man who listened patiently to his arguments. When John was done, the old man smiled and said, "My dear friend, do not set yourself up as a judge of truth and knowledge. You will only be shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods."</p>
   <p>John was confused by what the old man said. He had never heard of such a thing before. Nevertheless, he went home and thought about it. The more he pondered on it, the more he realized that the old man was right.</p>
   <p>It is easy to fall into the trap of thinking that we know everything there is to know. However, the truth is that there is always more to learn. When we set ourselves up as judges of truth and knowledge, we close ourselves off to new experiences and perspectives.</p>
   <p>Albert Einstein once said, "The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know." This statement reflects the humility that is necessary when seeking knowledge and truth. If even one of the greatest minds in history recognized the limitations of their own knowledge, we should do the same.</p>
   <h3></h3>
   <p>I once knew a person who felt that they knew everything there was to know about a certain topic. They would constantly argue with anyone who disagreed with them, even if they had no expertise in the subject matter. This person was eventually called out by a true expert in the field, and it was humiliating to watch. They learned a valuable lesson: there is no shame in admitting when you don't know something.</p>
   <p>Another story involves a friend of mine who thought they knew a lot about a certain culture. When they visited that culture's country, they were surprised to learn how wrong they were about many things. They quickly realized that their knowledge had been limited to what they had read in books. After experiencing the culture firsthand, they realized how much they had yet to learn.</p>
   <h3>Examples</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>A person who thinks they know everything there is to know about a certain subject</li>
    <li>A politician who refuses to listen to opinions other than their own</li>
    <li>A scientist who doesn't consider other theories and perspectives</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>Here are three key takeaways about avoiding the shipwreck of trying to judge Truth and Knowledge.</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Admit when you don't know something - there is no shame in being a learner.</li>
    <li>Be open-minded and listen to other perspectives - there is always more to learn.</li>
    <li>Recognize that no one has the ultimate truth - even the greatest minds in history recognized this.</li>
   </ol>
