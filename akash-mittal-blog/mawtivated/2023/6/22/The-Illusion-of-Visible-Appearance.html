    <h3>The Story of Author - Leon Jouhaux</h3>
    <p>Leon Jouhaux was a French trade union leader and Nobel Peace Prize recipient. He was born in 1879 in Pantin, France and started his career as a laborer in a printing press factory. He soon became an active member of the trade union movement and was appointed as the Secretary General of French General Confederation of Labour (CGT) in 1909. He was a vocal critic of World War I and played a crucial role in the formation of International Labour Organization (ILO) after the war. In 1951, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in promoting social justice and worker's rights.</p>
    <p>Jouhaux's story is an inspiration for those who strive for a better world with equal opportunities for all.

    <h3>The Illusion of Visible Appearance</h3>
    <p>We often make assumptions about things based on their visible appearance. We form opinions about people, events, and situations without fully understanding the underlying facts. Our lack of knowledge and sufficient reflection can mislead us into believing things that are not accurate.</p>
    <p>For example, we may judge people by their physical appearance or their speech. We may form an opinion about an event without knowing the complete story. We may assume that a situation is good or bad based on its surface-level attributes without delving into its complexities. Such assumptions can lead us to make wrong decisions and miss out on opportunities.</p>

    <h3> and Case Studies</h3>
    <p>My friend John had a job interview last week. He was well-dressed and groomed, but he stuttered while answering some questions. The interviewer was not impressed and rejected him, assuming that he lacked confidence and communication skills. However, John is one of the most talented and intelligent persons I know. His stuttering is a result of a speech disorder he has been struggling with since childhood.</p>
    <p>Similarly, a news article I read a few days ago reported a demonstration by a group of immigrants demanding better living conditions. The article focused on the disruption caused by the demonstration and the inconvenience caused to the public. It did not highlight the reasons behind the demonstration and the struggles of the immigrant community.</p>
    <p>These anecdotes and cases studies illustrate how our observations can be influenced by our preconceived notions and biases. It is imperative to look beyond the surface and seek more information before making judgments or decisions.</p>

    <h3>Examples of Visible Appearance vs. Reality</h3>
    <ul>
     <li>A celebrity who appears happy and successful but is struggling with mental health issues behind the scenes.</li>
     <li>A politician who gives impressive speeches but indulges in corruption and unethical practices.</li>
     <li>A food product that looks delicious but is unhealthy and contains harmful preservatives.</li>
     <li>A relationship that looks perfect on social media but has underlying problems and issues.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These examples demonstrate how our perception of things can be shaped by their visible appearance, without considering the underlying reality.</p>
