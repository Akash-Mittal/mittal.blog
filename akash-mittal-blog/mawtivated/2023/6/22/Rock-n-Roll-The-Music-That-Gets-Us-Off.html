   <h2>An Inspirational Story</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>It was the summer of 1980, and the sun was scorching hot. Beatrice, a young teenager in her own right, was sitting outside of her home, listening to the sounds of her radio. It was then that something remarkable happened. A guitar riff, accompanied by a pounding drum beat, caught her attention, and before she knew it, she was moving her hips, tapping her feet to the rhythm. She didn't know what it was, but this music got her off, and she couldn't get enough of it.</p>
   <p>That was the moment when Beatrice fell in love with rock 'n' roll. She became a fan of the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, and Aerosmith, to name a few. She discovered a passion for music that was raw, unapologetic, and full of energy. It was the music that spoke to her soul, and she knew that it was something that she would hold dear for the rest of her life.</p>
   <h3>The Background: Joan Jett</h3>
