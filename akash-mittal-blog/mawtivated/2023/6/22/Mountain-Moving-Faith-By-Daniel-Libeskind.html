    <h3>Daniel Libeskind</h3>
    <p>Daniel Libeskind is an American architect and New York City's Master Planner. He has designed some of the most iconic buildings in the world, including the Jewish Museum Berlin, the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, and the World Trade Center Master Plan. However, his life was not always easy.</p>
    <blockquote>
     I'm not Candide, nor Dr Pangloss, but we know that faith moves mountains.
    </blockquote>
    <p>As a child, Libeskind was born into a Jewish family in Poland and was forced to flee his home during World War II. His family settled in New York City, where they struggled to make a living. However, Libeskind's love of music and art helped him to find his passion in architecture. He went on to study at Cooper Union and eventually landed a job at the world-famous architectural firm, Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill (SOM).</p>
    <p>Despite his success, Libeskind faced many challenges throughout his career. His unconventional designs were often met with resistance from clients and fellow architects. However, he never wavered in his beliefs and always stood by his vision.</p>
