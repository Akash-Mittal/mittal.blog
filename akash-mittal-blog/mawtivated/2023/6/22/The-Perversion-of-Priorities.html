   <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
   <p>It was during a trip to India that John McGahern, the Irish novelist and memoirist, had an enlightening experience.</p>
   <p>He was travelling by train through the countryside when he saw a group of young boys playing on the roof of a building.</p>
   <p>As the train slowed down, McGahern noticed that the building was actually a prison.</p>
   <p>Despite the grim surroundings, the boys were laughing and shouting with joy.</p>
   <p>It was then that McGahern realized the profound truth that children don't know they're supposed to be miserable until they're told.</p>
   <p>This realization stayed with him for the rest of his life and influenced his writing, which often explored the themes of childhood, innocence, and the loss thereof.</p>
   <h2>Perverted Priorities</h2>
   <p>When it comes to societal priorities, however, things aren't always so innocent.</p>
   <p>McGahern himself once noted, "When I was in my 20s it did occur to me that there was something perverted about an attitude that thought that killing somebody was a minor offence compared to kissing somebody."</p>
   <blockquote>
    "When I was in my 20s it did occur to me that there was something perverted about an attitude that thought that killing somebody was a minor offence compared to kissing somebody."
   </blockquote>
   <p>In our society, violence is often given a lesser weight than intimacy.</p>
   <p>We hear stories of sexual misconduct everywhere; on the news, in social media, and in private conversations.</p>
   <p>But killings are often reported as isolated incidents, and soon forgotten.</p>
   <p>This is a perverted view of reality because it suggests that violence is less severe than intimacy, which is absurd.</p>
   <p>Violence has the power to destroy, whereas intimacy has the power to heal.</p>
   <p>Yet, somehow we've come to accept a culture that values kissing over killing.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Perversion</h2>
   <p>There are many examples of how our priorities are perverted when it comes to sex and violence.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>When a celebrity is caught in a scandalous affair, it makes headlines for days. But when a mass shooting occurs, it's viewed as just another tragedy.</li>
    <li>When a politician is caught in a sex scandal, it often leads to their downfall. But when a politician pushes for war, it's seen as a sign of strength.</li>
    <li>When a young person experiences sexual abuse, the focus is often on their behavior rather than the behavior of the abuser. But when someone is the victim of a violent crime, the focus is on finding the perpetrator.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>These examples illustrate how our culture values sex over violence, and how this perverted view can harm victims.</p>
   <h2>The Harm of Perversion</h2>
   <p>When violence is considered less severe than intimacy, the harm to victims can be devastating.</p>
   <p>When victims of sexual misconduct come forward, they are often met with skepticism or blame.</p>
   <p>They may even be accused of lying or exaggerating.</p>
   <p>This can discourage victims from speaking out, which perpetuates the cycle of abuse.</p>
   <p>When killers are seen as isolated incidents, their actions are not given the attention they deserve.</p>
   <p>Community members may fail to identify warning signs or to seek help for those who need it.</p>
   <p>This can lead to more violence and more devastation.</p>
   <h2>How to Prioritize Properly</h2>
   <p>If we want to create a healthy, just society, we need to prioritize properly.</p>
   <p>We need to understand the true consequences of violence and intimacy and value them accordingly.</p>
   <p>Here are three practical tips:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Believe survivors of sexual misconduct. Encourage them to speak out, and support them when they do. Listen to their stories, and use your voice to demand accountability.</li>
    <li>Recognize the impact of violence. When you hear about a killing, take a moment to reflect on the tragedy. Think about how you can prevent future violence by calling attention to warning signs and supporting mental health services.</li>
    <li>Teach the next generation. Children are not born knowing what our societal priorities are. Teach them the truth about the consequences of violence and intimacy, and model healthy relationships in your own life.</li>
   </ul>
