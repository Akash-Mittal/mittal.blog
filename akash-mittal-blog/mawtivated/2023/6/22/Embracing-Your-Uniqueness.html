  <h1>Embracing Your Uniqueness</h1></br> <img src="images/Embracing-Your-Uniqueness.jpeg" alt="+Embracing-Your-Uniqueness+"></br>
  <p>Have you ever felt like you didn't fit in? Like you were different from everyone else? I have. Growing up, I was always the odd one out. I didn't dress like everyone else, I didn't like the same music, and I didn't have the same hobbies. It was hard, but eventually I learned to embrace my uniqueness.</p>
  <h2>The Story of John Lennon</h2>
  <blockquote>
   "I'm not going to change the way I look or the way I feel to conform to anything. I've always been a freak. So I've been a freak all my life and I have to live with that, you know. I'm one of those people."
  </blockquote>
  <p>John Lennon was one of the most iconic musicians of the 20th century. He was also a freak. He didn't look or act like anyone else, and he didn't care. He embraced his uniqueness and used it to change the world.</p>
  <p>John Lennon and his bandmates in The Beatles were told that they would never make it in the music industry because they didn't have the right "look". But they didn't listen.
