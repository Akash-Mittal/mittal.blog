   <p>There was once a small village in a remote part of the world, where people of different religions and cultures lived together in harmony. One day, a group of outsiders came to the village and started to spread hate and intolerance towards those who were different from them. The villagers tried to reason with them, but they didn't listen. As a result, the village soon turned into a warzone, with families torn apart and children orphaned.</p>
   <p>This story is just one example of how wars start. It all begins when one or more parties involved in a conflict want something more than they want peace. It could be land, resources, power, or even an ideology. Whatever the reason, the desire for something more than peace can lead to devastating consequences.</p>
   <h2>The Author - Jeane Kirkpatrick</h2>
   <p>Jeane Kirkpatrick was an American diplomat and political scientist who served as the US Ambassador to the United Nations during the Reagan administration. She is best known for her conservative views on foreign policy and her support for US intervention in Latin America. Kirkpatrick believed in the idea of "authoritarianism" and that strong leaders were necessary to maintain stability in developing countries.</p>
   <h2>Why Does War Happen?</h2>
   <p>There are many reasons why wars happen, from resource scarcity to political ideologies. Here are a few examples:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Religious differences</li>
    <li>Territorial disputes</li>
    <li>Economic interests</li>
    <li>Power struggles</li>
    <li>Ideological differences</li>
    <li>Cultural clashes</li>
   </ul>
   <blockquote>
    "We have war when at least one of the parties to a conflict wants something more than it wants peace." - Jeane Kirkpatrick
   </blockquote>
   
   <p>Growing up in a war-torn country, I have seen firsthand the devastating effects of war. My family had to flee our home and leave everything we had behind. We lived in refugee camps for years before finally being able to start a new life in a new country.</p>
   <p>Another example is the Rwandan genocide, where almost a million people were killed in just 100 days. The genocide was fueled by ethnic tensions between the Hutus and Tutsis, but it was ultimately caused by a desire for power and control.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, wars happen when one or more parties involved in a conflict want something more than peace. This desire can be driven by many factors, including religious or cultural differences, territorial disputes, economic interests, power struggles, ideological differences, or cultural clashes. To prevent wars from happening, it is important to promote peace and understanding between different groups of people, and to address the root causes of conflicts through diplomacy and dialogue.</p>

    <li>Try to see things from the perspective of others</li>
