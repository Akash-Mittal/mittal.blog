    <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
    <p>John F. Kennedy once said, "Change is the law of life. And those who look only to the past or present are certain to miss the future." His words ring true to this day, as evidenced by the story of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p>
    <p>In 2018, Ocasio-Cortez was a 28-year-old bartender in the Bronx. She had no political experience. But she believed in the power of change and decided to challenge a longtime incumbent congressman in the primary election. Against all odds, she won.</p>
    <p>Ocasio-Cortez's victory was a stunning upset. It showed that a year can be an eternity in politics, as the political landscape can shift rapidly. But it also demonstrated that a year can be just enough time for a brilliant newcomer to come in and shake things up.</p>

    <h2>Eliot Spitzer's Background</h2>
    <p>Eliot Spitzer is another example of how much can happen in a year in politics. Spitzer was a rising star in the Democratic Party, serving as the Attorney General of New York from 1999 to 2006. In 2006, he was elected the Governor of New York.</p>
    <p>But just one year later, his political career was derailed by a scandal. It was revealed that he had been involved with a high-end prostitution ring. Spitzer resigned from office in disgrace.</p>
    <p>The lesson here is that a year can be less than a moment in history. Despite all of Spitzer's accomplishments, he will forever be known for this scandal. It goes to show that politicians must be careful and aware of the consequences of their actions.</p>

    <h2>Practical Examples and Tips</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>Elections can be unpredictable. Don't assume anything until the results are in.</li>
     <li>Stay true to your values. People will respect your authenticity and honesty.</li>
     <li>Be aware of the power of social media. A tweet or Instagram post can make or break a candidacy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>One practical example of the power of social media is the 2020 Democratic primary. Joe Biden was considered the front-runner for the nomination early on, but then Bernie Sanders gained momentum with his strong performance in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary. Social media played a big role in spreading Sanders' message and energizing his base.</p>
    <p>Another example is the 2016 presidential election. Hillary Clinton was expected to win, but then Donald Trump's use of social media helped him connect with voters and ultimately win the election.</p>
    <p>The key takeaway from these examples is that politicians must stay up-to-date with the latest technology and adapt to new ways of campaigning. Social media is a game-changer, and those who don't use it effectively will be left behind.</p>
