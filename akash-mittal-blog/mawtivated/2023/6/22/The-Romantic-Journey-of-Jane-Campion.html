   <h2>The Legacy of the Romantic Poets</h2>
   <blockquote>
    "The thing about the Romantic poets is that they've got the epitaph of romantic posthumously. They all died really young, and Keats, the youngest of them all," said Jane Campion.
   </blockquote>
   <p>One of the most popular literary movements of the 19th century was Romanticism, which was marked by a deep appreciation for the beauty and mystery of life. The Romantic poets were a group of writers who lived during this time and focused on the sublime and emotional aspects of the human experience.</p>
   <p>Their poetry and beliefs inspired a generation of writers and artists to break free from the conventions of their society and express themselves fully. Their work remains relevant to this day and continues to be celebrated for its romantic posthumous nature.</p>
   <h3>The Work of John Keats</h3>
   <p>John Keats is one of the most prominent of the Romantic poets, known for his deep and sensual writing that captured the essence of love and passion. His works, including "Ode to a Nightingale" and "Bright Star," remain some of the most celebrated poems of all time.</p>
   <p>Campion, who has explored Keats' work in her films, considers him to be one of the most inspiring poets of all time. He died at the young age of 25, but his work continues to inspire a new generation of poets and creatives.</p>
   <h4>Example: "Bright Star" in Jane Campion's Film</h4>
   <p>In her film "Bright Star," Campion explores the relationship between Keats and his love, Fanny Brawne. She often quotes from Keats' poems, including "Bright Star," which speaks to the idea of eternal love. The film presents a romanticized version of Keats' life, showing the beauty and passion of his poetry. It became a critical success and received multiple nominations for awards.</p>
