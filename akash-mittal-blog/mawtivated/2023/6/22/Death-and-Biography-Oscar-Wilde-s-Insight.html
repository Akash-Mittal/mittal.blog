    <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time, there was a man who was afraid of dying. He didn't want to leave the world without leaving a mark, without having his story told, his life remembered. So, he decided to write his autobiography. He spent years working on it, pouring his heart and soul into every chapter. When it was finally finished, he felt a sense of relief and accomplishment. He had left a legacy. But then, as he read the book, he realized something. He had focused so much on his achievements and successes that he had forgotten what truly mattered - the relationships he had formed, the moments he had shared with loved ones. He realized that if he had to do it all over again, he would have lived differently. He would have prioritized his relationships and experiences over his accomplishments.</p>
    <p>This man's experience highlights the power of biography and how it can lend a new terror to death. When we see our lives and legacies laid out on paper, it can be confronting. Have we lived our best lives? Have we treated those closest to us with kindness and love? Have we made a positive impact on the world?</p>

    <p>Oscar Wilde, known for his wit and wisdom, once said, "Biography lends to death a new terror." Wilde's own life was full of scandal and controversy, and perhaps this quote reflected his own fear of how he would be remembered after his death. However, his words are applicable to all of us, regardless of our social status or notoriety.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>One example of how biography can lend a new terror to death is the case of Steve Jobs. Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, was a widely respected and innovative entrepreneur who revolutionized the tech industry. However, after his death, a biography was published that shed light on his personal life and his treatment of others. The book, written by Walter Isaacson, revealed that Jobs could be abrasive and cruel to colleagues and family members. While Jobs' contributions to technology cannot be ignored, his legacy was complicated by this biography.</p>
    <p>Another example is Anne Frank. Frank's diary, detailing her experiences hiding from the Nazis during World War II, has become one of the most widely read books in the world. However, Frank's life was cut short when she and her family were discovered and sent to concentration camps. Her legacy, while powerful and inspiring, is also a reminder of the atrocities of war and the lives lost.</p>
