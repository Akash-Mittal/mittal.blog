    <p>Every great movement starts with one person who has a vision and the determination to bring it to life. That person becomes the driving force behind the movement and inspires others to join them in their quest. This is the story of Curt Schilling, a retired professional baseball player who used his platform to lead a movement and get people to believe in something bigger than themselves.</p>
    <h2>Background of Curt Schilling</h2>
    <p>Curt Schilling is a former Major League Baseball pitcher who played for 20 seasons with teams such as the Philadelphia Phillies, Arizona Diamondbacks, and Boston Red Sox. He won three World Series championships and was a six-time All-Star. But it was what he did off the field that truly made him a leader and an inspiration to many.</p>
    <p>After retiring from baseball, Schilling founded a video game company called 38 Studios. The company's first game, "Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning," was a critical and commercial success, but the company ultimately failed due to financial mismanagement and went bankrupt. Schilling lost millions of dollars of his own money in the process.</p>
    <p>Despite this setback, Schilling remained determined to succeed and to make a positive impact on the world. He became involved in politics and spoke publicly about his beliefs on issues such as healthcare and education. He also used his social media platforms to share his opinions and connect with people who shared his values.</p>
    <h2>Leading a Movement</h2>

He understood that in our individualistic society, it can be difficult to convince people to work together towards a common goal. But he also knew that it was possible.</p>
    <blockquote>
     "In this I-me society, my job is to get people to buy into something bigger than themselves."
    </blockquote>
    <p>Those words became Schilling's mission as he worked to inspire people to join him in his quest for a better world. He knew that he couldn't do it alone, but he also knew that he had the ability to bring people together and to create something powerful.</p>
