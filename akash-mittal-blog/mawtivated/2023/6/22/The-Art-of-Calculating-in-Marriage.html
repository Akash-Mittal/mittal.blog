   <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
  </header>
  <article>
   <p>Carol was once a young woman who dreamed of having a family of her own. She was in love with a charming man who promised her the world. They eventually got married, but it didn't take long for Carol to realize that her husband was not the man of her dreams. He spent most of their savings on gambling and was not interested in building a family.</p>
   <p>After years of trying to change him, Carol decided to take matters into her own hands. She went back to school, got a degree, and landed a high-paying job. She saved as much money as she could, and when she felt financially capable, she divorced her husband and started a new life.</p>
   <p>Today, Carol is happily married to a man who shares her values and ambitions. They have two beautiful children and a comfortable life, all because Carol learned the art of calculating when it comes to marriage.</p>

   <p>Carol's story is a perfect example of how crucial it is to be calculating in marriage. Being "calculating" does not necessarily mean being cold and manipulative. It means making rational decisions based on your priorities, values, and goals. Marriage is not just about romance and emotions, it is a lifelong partnership that requires careful planning and commitment.</p>
