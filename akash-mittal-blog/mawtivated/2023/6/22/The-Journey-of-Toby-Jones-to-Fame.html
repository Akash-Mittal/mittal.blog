  <p>Once upon a time, there was a man named Toby Jones. He was an aspiring actor and had a passion for acting since he was a child. He used to perform in front of his family and friends, and they were impressed by his talent.</p>
  <p>However, his journey to fame was not easy. He faced many rejections and hardships on his way to success. But he never gave up. He kept working hard and honing his craft.</p>
  <h2 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The Role of 'Capote'</h2>
  <p>One of the turning points in his career was when he got the role of Truman Capote in the movie 'Infamous'. He had heard about the project over a year before they began filming. His American agent had told him about it and recommended that he read 'In Cold Blood' as they were considering him for the role.</p>
  <blockquote>
   "Oh, you might want to read 'In Cold Blood' because they're talking about you for Capote, but the script's with Johnny Depp and Sean Penn at the moment."
  </blockquote>
  <p>Toby Jones knew that he had to put in a lot of effort to portray the character of Truman Capote as the portrayal was already done by Philip Seymour Hoffman in the movie 'Capote'. He read Truman Capote's books and watched his interviews to get into the character.</p>
  <p>Finally, his hard work paid off and he received positive reviews for his portrayal of Truman Capote.</p>
