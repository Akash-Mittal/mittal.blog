When she was on her deathbed, she said, "I am so glad to be going home." Her calmness and peace in the face of death is something that we can all learn from.</p>

    <h2 id="what">What is Death?</h2>
    <p>Death is the cessation of all biological functions that sustain a living organism. In other words, it is the end of life. Death can occur due to various reasons, including disease, injury, and old age. But regardless of the reason, death is an inevitable part of life.</p>

    <h2 id="fear">Why Men Fear Death</h2>
    <p>As Bacon said, men fear death just as children fear the dark. But why? One reason is the fear of the unknown. No one knows for sure what happens after death, and that uncertainty can be scary. Another reason is the fear of losing everything. When we die, we lose our loved ones, our possessions, and our worldly accomplishments. Finally, the fear of pain is also a factor. Many people worry about the pain that might accompany their death.</p>
    <blockquote>
     "The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time."
    </blockquote>
    <p>- Mark Twain</p>
    <p>Mark Twain, the famous American author, believed that the fear of death is rooted in the fear of life. If we live fully, we will be ready to die at any time. This is a useful mindset to adopt when dealing with the fear of death.</p>
