  <p>When was the last time you looked up at the night sky and noticed the colors of the stars? For many of us, stars are just tiny, twinkling lights in the sky. But for astronomer Maria Mitchell, studying the stars was a passion that led her to greatness.</p>
  <h2>Maria Mitchell: A Brief Background</h2>
  <p>Maria Mitchell was an American astronomer born in 1818. She discovered a new comet in 1847, becoming the first woman to do so. She was also the first woman appointed as a professor of astronomy at Vassar College.</p>
  <p>For Maria, studying the stars wasn't just about gathering scientific data. It was about discovering the beauty and wonder of the universe. She once said, "We especially need imagination in science. It is not all mathematics...we must also have a passion for seeing what is beautiful in the world."</p>
  <h2>Discovering the Colors of Stars</h2>
  <p>One way to find beauty in the night sky is to pay attention to the colors of the stars. You may be surprised to learn that stars come in a variety of colors, including blue, white, yellow, orange, and red.</p>
  <p>So, how can you learn to notice the colors of stars? Here are a few practical tips:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Find a dark, clear night sky away from city lights.</li>
   <li>Use a telescope or binoculars, if possible.</li>
   <li>Look for patterns of color among the stars.</li>
   <li>Pay attention to the brightness of the stars, as this can affect the perception of color.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>With a little practice, you'll begin to notice the different colors of the stars and appreciate the beauty of the night sky in a new way.</p>
  
  <p>When I was a kid, my dad would take us camping in the mountains. One night, we were sitting by the campfire and he pointed out the different colors of the stars. I didn't really understand what he was talking about, but I remember thinking it was pretty cool. Years later, I found myself staring up at the stars on a clear night and suddenly remembered that moment with my dad. It made me appreciate the stars in a new way and I'm grateful that he took the time to teach me about them.</p>
