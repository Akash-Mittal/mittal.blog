   <p>John was only 16 years old when he first tried drugs. It started with marijuana, but soon he moved to harder drugs like cocaine and heroin. He would steal from his family and friends to fund his addiction. His life was spiraling out of control until he found hope in an unlikely place - the Teen Challenge Training Center.</p>
   <p>The Teen Challenge Training Center on Pennsylvania farmland houses over 200 men in rehab. Other farms and centers have been birthed out of this ministry all over the world. The program is based on Christian principles and provides a structured environment for men and women to overcome addiction.</p>
   <h2>The Story behind Teen Challenge</h2>
   <p>The founder of this ministry, David Wilkerson, was just a young pastor in small-town Pennsylvania when he felt a strong calling from God to reach out to gang members in New York City. He moved to the city and started ministering to the gangs, offering them hope and a way out of their destructive lifestyles.</p>
   <p>One of the men he met was a young drug addict named Nicky Cruz. Nicky was a hardened criminal who had grown up in the streets and had been involved in gang warfare since he was a child. Through Wilkerson's ministry, Nicky found hope and gave his life to Christ. Today, Nicky Cruz is a well-known evangelist and has helped countless people find freedom from addiction.</p>
   <p>After seeing the tremendous impact of his ministry to the gangs, Wilkerson started Teen Challenge in 1958. The program has spread to over 130 countries and has helped millions of people break free from addiction.</p>
   <h2>How Teen Challenge Works</h2>
   <p>The program varies slightly from center to center, but the core principles remain the same. Teen Challenge provides a structured environment where residents are taught practical life skills, given counseling, and most importantly, learn about God's love for them.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Residents wake up early and have a full schedule of Bible studies, classes, work therapy, and recreation.</li>
    <li>They also participate in group counseling and one-on-one sessions with staff members.</li>
    <li>The program is typically 12 months long, but may be extended based on individual needs.</li>
    <li>Graduates of the program are encouraged to transition into a sober living environment and continue to stay connected to the Teen Challenge community.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Personal Stories of Transformation</h2>
   <p>John is just one of many people whose life has been transformed by the ministry of Teen Challenge. Here are a few other stories:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Susan was addicted to prescription painkillers for over a decade. She had lost everything - her job, her home, and her family. She thought she would never be able to overcome her addiction. But after participating in the Teen Challenge program, she has now been clean for 5 years and has rebuilt relationships with her loved ones.</li>
    <li>Mark had been in and out of jail for drug-related crimes for most of his adult life. He was skeptical about the program, but decided to give it a try. He credits Teen Challenge with helping him turn his life around and discover his purpose.</li>
