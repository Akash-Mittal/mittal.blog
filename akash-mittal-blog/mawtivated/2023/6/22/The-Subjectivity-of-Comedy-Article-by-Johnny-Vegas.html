  <h1>The Subjectivity of Comedy</h1></br> <img src="images/The-Subjectivity-of-Comedy-Article-by-Johnny-Vegas.jpeg" alt="+The-Subjectivity-of-Comedy-Article-by-Johnny-Vegas+"></br>
  <p>Comedy is a complex art form. It can make people laugh, cry, and think, but it can also leave them cold. We all have different senses of humor, and what is funny to one person may not be funny to another. This is why comedy is so subjective, and why it can be so difficult to create comedy that appeals to a wide audience.</p>
  <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
  <p>Johnny Vegas is a comedian who knows all too well the subjectivity of comedy. He started his career in the mid-1990s, performing at small comedy clubs and festivals. At first, he struggled to find an audience. His humor was crude, irreverent, and often offensive, and many people simply didn't find it funny.</p>
  <p>But Johnny didn't give up. He kept going to gigs, honing his craft, and trying out new material. Slowly but surely, he started to build a following. People began to appreciate his unique brand of humor, and he started to get more bookings.</p>
  <p>Today, Johnny is one of the UK's most successful comedians. He has appeared on numerous TV shows and in films, and he regularly performs to packed audiences around the country. But he hasn't forgotten the struggles he faced in the early days of his career. He knows better than anyone how subjective comedy can be, and how it can take time to find an audience.</p>
  <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
  <p>Comedy is subjective because it is based on individual tastes and preferences. What one person finds funny, another might find offensive or just plain boring. This is why successful comedians learn to appeal to a wide range of people without compromising their own unique style.</p>
  <p>Some comedians, like Louis C.K., Bill Burr, and Sarah Silverman, court controversy by tackling potentially offensive topics like race, gender, and politics. They know that some people may be offended by their material, but they also know that many people will find it funny and thought-provoking.</p>
  <p>Other comedians, like Ellen DeGeneres and Jim Gaffigan, take a more light-hearted approach to comedy. They focus on everyday experiences like family, relationships, and food, and often use physical humor or storytelling to get their point across. They know that their humor may not be everyone's cup of tea, but they also know that many people will relate to their material and find it hilarious.</p>
  <p>But whether a comedian is controversial or family-friendly, they all have one thing in common: they know how to connect with their audience. They understand what makes people laugh, and they have a knack for finding the funny side of even the most mundane or difficult aspects of life.</p>
  <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
  <p>If you're a comedian or aspiring comedian, here are some practical tips for finding your audience:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Write lots of material. The more material you have, the more options you have for tailoring your set to different audiences.</li>
   <li>Try out your material on different audiences. What works for one crowd may not work for another, so it's important to test your material in different settings.</li>
   <li>Be true to yourself. Don't try to be something you're not in order to please an audience. Authenticity is key to building a loyal fan base.</li>
   <li>Be patient. It takes time to build a following, so don't be discouraged if you don't have a huge following right away.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, comedy is subjective because people have different senses of humor. What one person finds funny, another may not. This is why successful comedians learn to appeal to a wide range of people without compromising their own unique style. If you're an aspiring comedian, it's important to write lots of material, try it out on different audiences, be true to yourself, and be patient.</p>
  <p>To quote Johnny Vegas, "Comedy's so subjective, and if someone comes to watch, doesn't get it, doesn't find it funny, then fine." It may take time to find your audience, but if you keep working at it and stay true to yourself, you will eventually find success.</p>
