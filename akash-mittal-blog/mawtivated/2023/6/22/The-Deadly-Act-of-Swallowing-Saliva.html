   <p>As human beings, we perform many activities without giving them much thought. One of these activities is the simple act of swallowing saliva. We do it without even realizing it, but did you know that it can be deadly if done over a long period of time?</p>
   <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
   <p>Let me tell you a story about John, a 40-year-old man who had a habit of constantly swallowing his saliva. He never thought much about it until one day he started experiencing symptoms like difficulty in breathing and chest pain. After consulting a doctor, he was diagnosed with a rare condition called salivary gland cancer. Unfortunately, John lost his battle with cancer and passed away soon after.</p>
   <p>This incident made me realize the seriousness of something as simple as swallowing saliva. If we ignore such things, they can have severe consequences, sometimes even resulting in death.</p>
   <h2>Death by Saliva – It's Real</h2>
   <p>Many people don't believe that death by swallowing saliva is possible, but it's a real phenomenon known as choking on saliva. Choking on saliva can occur when the muscles in the throat relax too much, and the saliva is not cleared properly. This can lead to choking and even death if the obstruction is not cleared promptly.</p>
   <p>Moreover, saliva contains certain enzymes and minerals that can be harmful in large quantities. Continuous accumulation of these substances in the body can lead to chronic diseases like cancer and kidney failure.</p>
   <h2>Examples</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Maya, a 30-year-old woman, was diagnosed with kidney failure after years of swallowing her saliva. Her doctor informed her that her kidneys were unable to filter out the minerals present in the saliva, eventually leading to kidney failure.</li>
    <li>Tom, a 50-year-old man, died of choking after accidentally swallowing his saliva while sleeping. His wife found him unresponsive in bed and called the emergency services, but it was too late.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, swallowing saliva may seem like a minor activity, but it can have grave consequences if not addressed promptly. If you or someone you know has a habit of swallowing saliva excessively, it's time to take it seriously and make changes for better health. Here are three practical tips to keep in mind:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Be aware of your habits – Try to observe your daily routine and identify habits that may be harmful to your health.</li>
    <li>Stay hydrated – Drinking water regularly can help flush out harmful minerals and enzymes from your body.</li>
    <li>Regular check-ups – It's crucial to get regular health check-ups to detect any underlying conditions that may be caused by unhealthy habits like swallowing saliva.</li>
   </ol>
