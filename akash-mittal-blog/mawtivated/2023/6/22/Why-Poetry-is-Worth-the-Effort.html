    <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
    <p>About a decade ago, when I was studying literature in college, I came across a poem by Emily Dickinson. It was a simple yet beautiful poem, but I didn't quite understand it at the time. However, something about the rhythm and the words stayed with me. Fast forward a few years, and I found myself going through a tough time. I remembered that Dickinson poem and decided to revisit it. This time, it spoke to me in a way that it never had before. It was like I was seeing the world through fresh eyes, and the poem gave me the words to articulate my thoughts and emotions.</p>
    <p>That experience made me realize the power of poetry, and it's something that has stayed with me ever since.</p>

    <h2>Background of Jane Campion</h2>
    <p>Jane Campion is an award-winning filmmaker and screenwriter hailing from New Zealand. She's known for her unique storytelling style that often combines poetry and cinema. When asked about her relationship with poetry, she said:</p>
    <blockquote>
     "Poetry has always been important to me. I vastly prefer to be with poets than with politicians."
    </blockquote>
    <p>Campion's work is a testament to the influence that poetry can have on other creative forms.</p>

    <h2>Why Poetry Needs to be Met</h2>
    <p>As Campion said, poetry does need to be met to some extent. It's not always an easy task - especially when we're talking about 19th-century poets like Dickinson and Keats, whose works can sometimes feel daunting and unfamiliar. But the effort is worth it.</p>
    <p>Here are a few reasons why:</p>
    <ul>
     <li><strong>It cultivates empathy</strong>: Poetry often puts us in someone else's shoes, making us more understanding and compassionate towards the human experience.</li>
     <li><strong>It improves our language skills</strong>: The study and appreciation of poetry helps us become better writers and communicators, as it introduces us to new vocabulary, syntax, and rhetorical devices.</li>
     <li><strong>It expands our worldview</strong>: Poetry can take us to places and times we've never been, allowing us to explore different cultures, histories, and perspectives.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Planting a Garden in Your Head</h2>
    <p>As I mentioned earlier, revisiting that Dickinson poem was like planting a garden in my head. Poetry has a way of growing and blossoming in unexpected ways, long after we've first encountered it. Here are a few examples of how poetry can continue to enrich our lives:</p>
    <ul>
     <li><strong>It can become a source of comfort</strong>: When we're feeling lost or alone, poetry can offer us a sense of connection and solace.</li>
     <li><strong>It can inspire us to create</strong>: Many great artists, from Bob Dylan to Sylvia Plath, have cited poetry as a major influence on their work.</li>
     <li><strong>It can help us make sense of the world</strong>: Poetry has a way of distilling complex emotions and ideas into simple yet profound statements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>To sum up, here are three key takeaways:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Poetry has the power to cultivate empathy, improve language skills, and expand our worldview.</li>
     <li>Metting poetry - even if it takes some effort - is worth it because it can become a source of comfort, inspiration, and understanding.</li>
     <li>As Jane Campion said, poetry is an important part of the human experience, and we should make an effort to seek it out and appreciate it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So the next time you come across a poem that speaks to you, take a moment to savor it and let it grow in your mind. You never know how it might bloom.</p>
