   <p>When I was governor of New Jersey, I had the honor of presiding over the state's first civil union ceremony. At the time, it was the best we could do to ensure that same-sex couples had some of the legal protections that marriage offers. But I knew even then that civil union was not enough. It was not equal to marriage, which has been valued and protected for centuries.</p>
   <p>Marriage is an institution that signifies commitment, love, and family. It is a sacred bond between two people who want to spend their lives together. For many, it is the ultimate expression of love and partnership. It is a right that should be afforded to everyone, regardless of their sexual orientation.</p>
   <h2>The Case Against Civil Union</h2>
   <p>There are several reasons why civil unions are not equal to marriage:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Legal Protections</strong>: Civil unions do not offer all the legal protections and benefits that marriage does. For example, in many states, civil unions do not provide the same rights as marriage when it comes to property, inheritance, immigration, and healthcare.</li>
    <li><strong>Stigma</strong>: Civil unions are often seen as a "lesser" institution than marriage. This stigma can lead to discrimination and prejudice against same-sex couples.</li>
    <li><strong>Symbolism</strong>: Marriage has been a symbol of love and commitment for centuries. By denying same-sex couples the right to marry, we are sending a message that their love is not as valuable or important as that of heterosexual couples.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>It is clear that civil unions fall short when it comes to protecting the rights and dignity of same-sex couples. In order to truly ensure equality for all, we need to afford marriage equal protection under the law.</p>
   <h2>Personal Story: My Journey to Support Same-Sex Marriage</h2>
   <p>I must confess that I was not always a supporter of same-sex marriage. Like many people, I grew up in a time when the idea of same-sex marriage was practically unheard of. It wasn't until I became governor that I started to rethink my views on the subject.</p>
   <p>As governor, I had the opportunity to meet with many same-sex couples and hear their stories. I saw firsthand how their love and commitment was just as real and valid as that of any heterosexual couple. I also saw how the lack of legal protections was causing them undue hardship and pain.</p>
   <p>It was then that I realized that denying same-sex couples the right to marry was not just unfair—it was unconstitutional. I became a vocal supporter of same-sex marriage, and I am proud to say that New Jersey became the 14th state to legalize it in 2013.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Discrimination Against Same-Sex Couples</h2>
   <p>Discrimination against same-sex couples is still a very real problem in our country. Consider the following:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>In many states, same-sex couples can still be fired from their jobs or denied housing simply because of their sexual orientation.</li>
    <li>Some religious organizations refuse to perform same-sex marriages or provide services to LGBTQ+ individuals, citing their deeply held beliefs.</li>
    <li>Transgender individuals face unique challenges when it comes to obtaining legal documentation or accessing healthcare.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>These examples demonstrate the urgent need for equal protection under the law for LGBTQ+ individuals.</p>
   <blockquote>
    "Marriage is more than a legal contract; it is a social and cultural institution that has evolved over time. It is a powerful symbol of love, commitment, and family, and denying same-sex couples the right to marry perpetuates discrimination and inequality." - James McGreevey
   </blockquote>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, the fight for equal rights for same-sex couples is far from over. While progress has been made, there is still much work to be done. Here are three practical steps we can take to continue the fight for equality:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Support organizations that advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, such as the Human Rights Campaign or GLAAD.</li>
    <li>Vote for political candidates who support equality and are willing to fight for LGBTQ+ rights.</li>
    <li>Speak out against discrimination and prejudice whenever you see it, whether it be in your personal life or in public discourse.</li>
   </ol>
