   <p>Once upon a time, there was a king who wanted to raise taxes to fund his conquests. His advisors told him that he needed to please the people if he wanted them to pay more taxes. The king agreed and started to distribute wealth among his subjects. He built public parks, distributed free food, and organized festivals. To his surprise, the people were happy and willing to pay more taxes.</p>
   <p>The king had discovered the balance between taxation and pleasure. To tax and to please, no more than to love and to be wise, is not given to men, as Edmund Burke once said. This balance is not easy to achieve, but it is essential for a healthy and prosperous society.</p>
   <h2>The Story of Edmund Burke</h2>
   <p>Edmund Burke was an Irish statesman and philosopher who lived in the 18th century. He is best known for his writings on political philosophy, which influenced many thinkers of his time and later. Burke believed that society was more than an aggregation of individuals, and that tradition and custom were essential for its stability and progress. He was also a critic of the French Revolution, which he saw as a dangerous attempt to destroy the foundations of society.</p>
   <p>In Burke's view, taxation was necessary to fund the state, but it had to be done with care and moderation. He believed that taxes should be imposed only for the common good, and that their burden should be distributed equally among the citizens. He also argued that excessive taxation could lead to the impoverishment and rebellion of the people, and that it was the duty of the state to avoid such a scenario.</p>
   <h2>Examples of the Balance Between Taxation and Pleasure</h2>
   <p>One example of the balance between taxation and pleasure is the Nordic welfare model. In countries such as Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, taxes are high, but the state provides a wide range of services, including free healthcare, education, and social welfare. These countries also have high levels of happiness and social trust, which are essential for a cohesive society.</p>
   <p>Another example is the corporate social responsibility movement, which encourages companies to contribute to the well-being of society. Many companies now donate a part of their profits to charity or environmental causes, and organize volunteer programs for their employees. This helps to improve the company's image and attract customers and employees who share the same values.</p>
