  <h1>Love is Love's Reward</h1></br> <img src="images/Love-is-Love-s-Reward.jpeg" alt="+Love-is-Love-s-Reward+"></br>
  <p>Once upon a time, there was a young man named John. He was a hopeless romantic, always seeking for true love. But every time he thought he found it, he was disappointed. He had his heart broken many times. One day, he met a wise old man who listened to his story and said:</p>
  <blockquote>
   "My dear boy, what you seek is not just any love, but unconditional love. Love that doesn't expect anything in return. Love that gives and gives without expecting reward. Love that is patient, kind, and forgiving. Love that is selfless. That is true love. And when you find it, you will receive the greatest reward of all."
  </blockquote>
  <p>John was skeptical, but he decided to take the old man's advice and seek for unconditional love. He learned that true love is not about finding someone who meets all your expectations, but about loving someone even with their flaws and imperfections. He learned that true love is not just a feeling, but a choice to love, no matter what. And he learned that true love is not just for receiving, but for giving. And so, he began his journey to find true love.</p>
