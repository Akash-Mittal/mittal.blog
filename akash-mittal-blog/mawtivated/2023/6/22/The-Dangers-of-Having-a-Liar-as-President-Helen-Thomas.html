  <p>Once upon a time, there was a country that was built on honesty, integrity and trust. The people of this country held their leaders to high standards and expected nothing less than the truth. The leaders of this country were revered and respected for their honesty and transparency in all their dealings. Unfortunately, this country no longer exists.</p>
  <p>In today's world, lying has become an acceptable norm in politics. Many politicians believe that lying is a necessary tool to get ahead and gain power. In fact, some politicians have mastered the art of lying to an extent that it has become hard to tell the difference between the truth and lies. This is a dangerous trend and one that should not be allowed in any society.</p>
  <h2>The Dangers of Having A Liar as President - Helen Thomas</h2>
  <p>As a journalist who has covered several US Presidents, Helen Thomas was a keen observer of political affairs in the United States. She was known for her straightforward and honest approach to journalism. She once said,</p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>The day Dick Cheney is going to run for president, I'll kill myself. All we need is another liar... I think he'd like to run, but it would be a sad day for the country if he does.</p><cite>Helen Thomas</cite>
  </blockquote>
  <p>These words are incredibly powerful and accurate. Having a President who is known to lie can have disastrous consequences for a society. Below are some of the dangers of having a liar as President:</p>
  <h3>1. Trust is Broken</h3>
  <p>Trust is the foundation of any society. When a leader lies, he or she breaks the trust of the people. The more a President lies, the less likely people are to believe anything he or she says. In the end, the country becomes divided, and the people lose faith in their leaders.</p>
  <h3>2. Dangerous Policies</h3>
  <p>A President who lies can be dangerous. He or she can release policies that are harmful to society or the country's economy. The President can create a policy that benefits a few individuals at the expense of the majority of the people. The lies can also lead to corruption and cover-ups, which can further destabilize the country.</p>
  <h3>3. Lack of Accountability</h3>
  <p>When a President lies, it can be hard to hold him or her accountable for their actions. The President can lie about their mistakes and hide behind the lies. Accountability is essential in any society and a President who lies can undermine this important aspect.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion - Helen Thomas</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, having a liar as President can be dangerous for any country. The trust of the people is broken, dangerous policies are created, and accountability is lacking.
