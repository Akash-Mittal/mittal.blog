  <h1>The Balanced Humanist: Finding Harmony between Sympathy and Selection</h1></br> <img src="images/The-Balanced-Humanist-Finding-Harmony-between-Sympathy-and-Selection.jpeg" alt="+The-Balanced-Humanist-Finding-Harmony-between-Sympathy-and-Selection+"></br>
  <p>Once upon a time, there was a man named John who lived in a small town. One day, while walking along a river, he saw a scorpion struggling in the water. Without hesitation, John reached in and pulled the scorpion out, but as he did so, the scorpion stung him. As John lay on the ground writhing in pain, a passerby asked him why he would risk being stung for the sake of a scorpion. John looked up and said, "just because it's in the nature of a scorpion to sting, doesn't mean it's not in my nature to help."</p>
  <p>This is a story of sympathy and kindness prevailing over natural impulses. What does it mean to be a true humanist? In the words of Irving Babbitt, a 19th century scholar and philosopher, "The true humanist maintains a just balance between sympathy and selection." In other words, the humanist seeks to balance his or her tendencies towards empathy and compassion with a discerning mind that is able to make wise choices.</p>
  <h2>What is Humanism?</h2>
  <p>Humanism is a philosophical and ethical stance that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings, individually and collectively, and generally prefers critical thinking and evidence (rationalism, empiricism) over acceptance of dogma or superstition. It upholds individual freedom, human reason, and a search for truth as the basis of morality and decision-making. Humanism prizes the uniqueness of each individual and encourages the full development of human potential.</p>
  <h2>Irving Babbitt and the True Humanist</h2>
  <p>Irving Babbitt was a professor of French literature and an advocate of classical humanism. He believed that true humanism was not just about empathy and compassion, but also about discernment and judgment. The true humanist recognizes that emotions like sympathy can cloud our judgment and prevent us from seeing things clearly. Babbitt argues that we need to maintain a balance between our emotions and our rational minds if we want to make wise decisions.</p>
  <p>Babbitt's philosophy is based on the idea that there is a universal human nature that transcends cultures and time periods. He believed that all humans share a set of values and virtues that are necessary for a flourishing life, such as self-control, decency, and prudence. The true humanist recognizes these values and seeks to cultivate them in himself and others.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Humanism</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>A humanist doctor who is compassionate towards his patients, but also able to make tough decisions about their treatment based on medical evidence.</li>
   <li>A humanist teacher who inspires her students with empathy and kindness, but also holds them to high standards of academic excellence.</li>
   <li>A humanist politician who is guided by principles of justice and compassion, but also makes tough decisions about policy based on evidence and reason.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>How to Be a Balanced Humanist?</h2>
  <p>Being a balanced humanist requires a combination of empathy and discernment. Here are some practical tips:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Practice empathy: Learn to see things from other people's perspectives. Listen to their stories and understand their struggles.</li>
   <li>Cultivate discernment: Develop critical thinking skills and learn to evaluate arguments and evidence objectively. Avoid knee-jerk reactions and take time to consider different viewpoints.</li>
   <li>Maintain balance: Strive for harmony between your emotions and your rational mind. Don't let your feelings cloud your judgment, but also don't become so rational that you lose touch with your humanity.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>To be a true humanist, we must strive for a balance between sympathy and selection. We need empathy to connect with others and understand their struggles, but we also need discernment to make wise decisions and avoid being swayed by our emotions. We must cultivate the virtues that are essential for a flourishing life, such as self-control, courage, and prudence. By practicing empathy, cultivating discernment, and maintaining balance, we can become balanced humanists who make a positive impact on the world.</p>
