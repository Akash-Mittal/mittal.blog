  <h1>Public Confidence in the Integrity of Government and its Indispensability to Faith in Democracy</h1></br> <img src="images/Public-Confidence-in-the-Integrity-of-Government-and-its-Indispensability-to-Faith-in-Democracy.jpeg" alt="+Public-Confidence-in-the-Integrity-of-Government-and-its-Indispensability-to-Faith-in-Democracy+"></br>
  <p>It was a bright and beautiful day in a small town when a mother and her child were walking back home after their day out. The little girl, who was no more than seven years old, seemed to be in deep thought. Finally, she spoke up and said, "Mom, what does democracy mean? We hear a lot about it, but I don't understand what it really is."</p>
  <p>The mother, who was unaware of how to explain the concept, took a deep breath and said, "It means that we live in a country where people have the right to elect their leaders who will make decisions for the betterment of society. It is a form of government that gives power to the people."</p>
  <p>The little girl seemed satisfied with the explanation and they continued walking. However, the mother couldn't stop thinking about what she had just said. She realized that the little girl's question was poignant â€“ the meaning of democracy had been slowly fading away, and public confidence in the integrity of the government was at an all-time low.</p>
  <p>Adlai E. Stevenson once said, "Public confidence in the integrity of the government is indispensable to faith in democracy and when we lose faith in the system, we have lost faith in everything we fight and spend for." Stewart Burns, a biographer of Stevenson, said that he used the phrase to express his belief that the essence of democratic government lies in the consent and cooperation of the ruled and the rulers.</p>
  <h2>The Importance of Public Confidence in the Integrity of Government</h2>
  <p>Public confidence in the integrity of the government is crucial for the smooth functioning of democracy. It is the backbone of democracy that encourages citizens to assume their roles as stakeholders in their government. When the government is transparent and trustworthy, the public can confidently participate in decision-making processes and trust the outcomes. This paves the way for peaceful coexistence, free and fair elections and fosters the rule of law.</p>
  <p>However, public trust in the government has been dwindling over the last few years. One need not look very far to understand why this is happening. Across different parts of the world, many governments are rife with corruption and scandal. This leads to a culture of cynicism and apathy where citizens question the legitimacy of their elected officials or stop engaging in the political process altogether fearing they are supporting a corrupt system.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Low Public Confidence in the Integrity of Government</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>The 2020 elections in the United States were marked by claims of widespread voter fraud that led to a perception of illegitimacy of the presidency amongst the losing side, which significantly lowered the public's confidence in the electoral process.</li>
   <li>Brazil, which is currently facing a crisis in democracy where their elected officials have failed to address the needs of their citizens, Brazilian elections have been marred by scandals that have led to instances of voter fraud, which has significantly lowered public trust in the electoral process.</li>
   <li>India is facing a crisis of institutional integrity where the country is being run from a centralised Modi government, undermining the Constitution's spirit of federalism, protecting democracy against authoritarianism. This state of affairs has led to protests all over the country, leading many to believe that the elected officials are no longer capable of governing the country in the interest of its citizens.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>My personal experience with a lack of public trust in the government was when I saw the farmers' protests in India.&nbsp;&nbsp; These protests were triggered after the government enacted three new farm policies to promote private investment in agriculture, claiming that their policies will lead to progress in the sector when the farmers saw such policies as ways of promoting corporate interests at the cost of the farmers. This led to months of protests and demonstrations.</p>
  <p>They demanded the repeal of the policies and the provision of more market intervention by the government to protect them. The public turned a blind eye to their struggle, with many asking why the farmers didn't trust the government to protect their rights. However, the government's credibility was so low that farmers took to the streets to express their voice, as they grew weary of their lack of faith in the government.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>We need to recognise that public confidence in the integrity of the government is crucial for the smooth functioning of democracy.</li>
   <li>All stakeholders in governance, including citizens, have a responsibility to uphold the values that make democracy work.</li>
