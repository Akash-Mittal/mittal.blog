    <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
    <p>Imagine being in a situation where you have the choice to dwell on the past, worry about the future or embrace the present and be happy for this moment. This is exactly what happened to a man named Jon, who was diagnosed with a terminal illness and was given only six months to live. Instead of being consumed by fear and despair, Jon made a conscious decision to make the most of his remaining time. He spent his time with his loved ones, did things he never thought he could do and even started his own business. Jon realized that the present moment was all he had and he wanted to make it count. In his last days, Jon was surrounded by the love and affection of his friends and family, and he left this world with a smile on his face, at peace with himself and the world.</p>

    <h2>Embracing Life</h2>
    <p>Life is precious, but it is also unpredictable. We never know what the next moment will bring, which is why it is important to be happy for this moment. Here are some tips on how to embrace life:</p>
    <ul>
     <li><strong>Practice gratitude:</strong> Take a moment to appreciate the good things in your life. Focus on what you have rather than what you don't have.</li>
     <li><strong>Become aware of the present moment:</strong> Pay attention to your surroundings, your thoughts and your feelings. Practice mindfulness to fully experience the present moment.</li>
     <li><strong>Do things that make you happy:</strong> Life is too short to do things that don't bring you joy. Make time for the things that make you happy, whether it's spending time with loved ones, pursuing a hobby or traveling to a new place.</li>
     <li><strong>Let go of the past and worry less about the future:</strong> The past is gone and the future is yet to come. Focus on the present moment and the things you can control.</li>
     <li><strong>Spread kindness:</strong> Acts of kindness not only make other people feel good, but they also make you feel good. Be generous with your time, your resources and your love.</li>
    </ul>
