   <p>An Inspiring Story about the Journey towards Freedom</p>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>It was a sunny day in the small town of Selma, Alabama when Mary met her mother for the first time. She had been sold as a slave when she was just a baby and had been separated from her family ever since. Mary was now 15 years old and had escaped from her captors with the help of abolitionists who believed in her right to freedom. When she finally saw her mother, tears flowed down her cheeks as they embraced each other, knowing that they were now free to make a new life for themselves.</p>
   <p>The story of Mary and her mother is just one example of how emancipation changed the lives of millions of African Americans in America. Emancipation was the act of freeing slaves from their owners and giving them the right to live as free men and women. In America, this process was a complex journey that started with the arrival of African slaves in the 17th century and culminated in the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863.</p>
   <h2>Author - Wendell Willkie Story</h2>
   <p>Wendell Willkie was a lawyer and businessman who played a significant role in American politics during the mid-20th century. He was a Republican nominee for the presidential election of 1940, where he challenged President Franklin Roosevelt. Although he lost the election, he became an inspiration to millions of Americans who believed in his message of unity and freedom.</p>
   <h2>Emancipation as a War Measure</h2>
   <p>The Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 was issued by President Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War. It declared that all slaves in the Confederate states were to be set free and that the Union Army would protect their freedom. The Proclamation was not just a humanitarian gesture, but also a war measure that helped the Union Army to gain an advantage over the Confederacy.</p>
   <p>According to Lincoln, emancipation was a military necessity that would help the Union win the war. It deprived the Confederacy of their labor force and strengthened the Union Army as African American soldiers joined its ranks. The Proclamation also had a significant impact on the international stage, as it made it difficult for European powers to support the Confederacy, which was fighting to preserve slavery.</p>
   <h2>Emancipation as a Humanitarian Reform</h2>
   <p>Although the Emancipation Proclamation was a war measure, it had deep humanitarian implications. It sent a message to millions of slaves that their freedom was within reach and that they had the support of the Union Army. It also changed the narrative of the Civil War from a mere clash of ideologies to a struggle for human rights and dignity.</p>
   <p>Emancipation was also the result of decades of struggle by abolitionists and African Americans who fought for their rights. The Underground Railroad, which helped slaves escape to freedom, was just one example of the non-violent methods used by African Americans to challenge the institution of slavery. Other methods included petitions, speeches, boycotts, and publications.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Emancipation was a complex process that started with the arrival of African slaves in America and culminated in the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863</li>
    <li>Emancipation was both a war measure and a humanitarian reform</li>
    <li>Emancipation was the result of decades of struggle by abolitionists and African Americans who fought for their rights</li>
