    </ul>
    <p>It wasn't easy, but Cooney never gave up. He worked hard and persevered, even when things got tough.</p>
    <blockquote>
     "Growing up training, I use to get up so early I would wave to the garbage men going by. So, I had this relationship with Blue Collar America and I really liked it. I felt that lots of those people looked forward to me winning."
    </blockquote>
    <p>Cooney had a deep respect for the hardworking people of his community, many of whom worked in blue-collar jobs. He knew that these were the people who would be there for him when he needed them most.</p>
