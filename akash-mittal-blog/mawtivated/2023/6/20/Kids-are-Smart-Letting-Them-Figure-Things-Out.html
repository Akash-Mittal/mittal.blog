   <h2>Inspiring Story</h2>
   <p>One day, a little girl named Ruby and her father were walking in a park when they stumbled upon a butterfly cocoon. Ruby was puzzled as to why the butterfly wasn't coming out of the cocoon, even though it had been there for quite some time. Her father explained that the butterfly needed to struggle to get out of the cocoon in order to become strong enough to fly. Realizing this, little Ruby decided to leave the butterfly to its own devices and let it struggle.</p>
   <h2>About the Author</h2>
   <p>Lauren Myracle is an American author of young adult fiction, best known for the novel "Internet Girls" series. Myracle has received various awards for her works, including the Parents' Choice Award and the ALA Best Books for Young Adults award.</p>
   <h2>Why Kids are Smart</h2>
   <p>Kids are naturally curious and inquisitive, which makes them incredibly smart. They have an innate desire to learn and explore the world around them. As such, it's important to encourage this desire rather than suppress it. They are naturally good at figuring things out if they are given the freedom to do so.</p>
   <h2>Knowledge is Power</h2>
   <p>It is a well-known fact that knowledge is power. The more knowledge kids acquire, the more they are equipped to face the challenges of the world. However, knowledge doesn't necessarily have to come from teachers or books. Kids can learn a great deal from personal experiences and everyday activities - if we let them.</p>
   <h2>Let Them Figure Things Out</h2>
   <p>As adults, we are often inclined to jump in and solve problems for our kids. However, this can hinder their growth and development. When we let kids figure things out on their own, we are helping them build problem-solving skills, which will serve them well in adulthood.</p>
   <h3>Examples</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>If your child is struggling with a homework assignment, instead of simply giving them the answers, try asking them questions that will help guide them towards the solution.</li>
    <li>If your child is having trouble zipping up their jacket, instead of doing it for them, show them how to do it and then let them practice.</li>
    <li>If your child is having a disagreement with a friend, let them navigate the situation on their own before intervening.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3></h3>
   <p>One day, my daughter was trying to build a tower out of blocks but was having trouble getting it to stand up. I wanted to help her but instead, I decided to let her figure it out on her own. After some trial and error, she eventually figured out the right placement for the blocks and was able to build a tall tower.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Letting kids figure things out on their own helps build problem-solving skills.</li>
    <li>Kids are naturally smart and curious, which makes them excellent learners.</li>
    <li>Encouraging kids to learn from personal experiences can be just as valuable as traditional education.</li>
   </ol>
   <h3>Practical Tips</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Ask open-ended questions to guide your child towards solving problems on their own.</li>
    <li>Encourage your child to experiment and try new things.</li>
    <li>Provide a safe environment for your child to explore and learn.</li>
