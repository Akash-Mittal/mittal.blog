   <p>An Inspiring Story</p>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>There was once a small boy who loved playing with his toy cars. He would spend hours racing them around the house, imitating the sounds of a roaring engine. One day, while playing in the garden, he noticed his neighbor Mr. Smith, an old man who lived alone, struggling to carry heavy bags of groceries from his car to his house. Without thinking twice, the boy rushed to help him and carried the bags for him. Mr. Smith was so grateful that he invited the boy to have a cup of hot cocoa with him. As they sat together, Mr. Smith told the boy about his life and the hardships he had faced. From that day on, the boy visited Mr. Smith every week and helped him with his tasks. They became good friends and found joy in each other's company.</p>
   <p>This story shows us that true compassion and courage are not heroic acts that require great bravery or sacrifice. They are small, everyday gestures of kindness and empathy towards others, even strangers. As Mo Yan, an acclaimed Chinese author and Nobel Prize winner, said, "I know what real courage is, and I understand true compassion."</p>
