   <h2>An Inspiring Story on Why We Need to Protect Our Children</h2>
  </header>
  <section>
   <p>Did you know that more than 8,000 young adults die from gun violence every year in the United States?</p>
   <p>It wasn't until I heard the story of a young boy named Tim that I realized just how important it is to protect children from gun violence. Tim was only 10 when he was accidentally shot and killed by a friend who had easy access to a loaded gun.</p>
   <p>Tim's story is just one of many that highlights the urgent need for stricter laws on gun ownership by juveniles. As a society, we must take action to keep our children safe.</p>
   <h2>The Importance of Raising the Age for Juvenile Gun Ownership</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>The current minimum age for owning a gun in most states is 18.</li>
    <li>However, many states have no minimum age for possessing a firearm, so long as the child has parental consent.</li>
    <li>This means that children as young as 10 can legally possess a deadly weapon!</li>
    <li>Research has shown that the earlier someone gains access to a gun, the more likely they are to use it in a negative way.</li>
    <li>This is why it's important to consider raising the minimum age for gun ownership to 21, or even 25.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Why President George W. Bush Supports Raising the Age for Juvenile Gun Ownership</h2>
   <blockquote>
    "I think we ought to raise the age at which juveniles can have a gun."
   </blockquote>
   <p>As a strong advocate for gun control measures, former President George W. Bush understands the importance of enacting stricter laws to protect our children.</p>
   <p>He believes that by raising the age for juvenile gun ownership, we can reduce the number of senseless gun-related deaths and injuries among young adults.</p>
   <h2>Examples of States Taking Action</h2>
   <p>Fortunately, some states are already taking steps to raise the minimum age for gun ownership:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Florida - Following the tragic Parkland shooting, Florida lawmakers raised the age for purchasing a firearm from 18 to 21.</li>
    <li>Vermont - In 2018, Vermont became the first state to pass a law raising the minimum age for gun ownership to 21.</li>
    <li>Hawaii - Hawaii also has a minimum age of 21 for gun ownership.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Practical Tips for Keeping Children Safe from Gun Violence</h2>
   <p>While we work towards stricter gun control laws, there are things we can all do to keep our children safe:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Secure all guns in the home, out of reach of children.</li>
    <li>Talk to your children about the dangers of guns and the importance of gun safety.</li>
    <li>Encourage lawmakers to support gun control measures that protect our children.</li>
    <li>Support organizations that work to prevent gun violence and promote gun safety.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>With more than 36,000 deaths and over 100,000 injuries related to guns each year in the US, it's clear that something needs to be done to protect our citizens.</p>
   <p>By raising the minimum age for juvenile gun ownership, we can reduce the likelihood of gun-related violence and ensure that our children are safe. Ultimately, we have a responsibility to take action and put measures in place to protect our communities.</p>
