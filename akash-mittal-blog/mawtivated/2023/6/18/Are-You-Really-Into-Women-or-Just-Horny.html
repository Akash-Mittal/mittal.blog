    <h3>The Story of John</h3>
    <p>John was a young man who just turned sixteen and was excited to start dating. He had many female friends, but never felt any attraction towards them. Whenever his friends talked about attractive women, John could never relate. He thought he might be gay, but he was not interested in men either. One day, he stumbled upon an erotic video and he felt a strong sexual desire towards the women in the video. He felt guilty about his attraction and thought he might be a sex addict. He sought help from a therapist who explained to him that what he was experiencing was completely natural. John was just horny and his sexual desire did not necessarily mean that he was into women. This realization helped John differentiate between his sexual desires and his emotional attraction towards women.</p>

    <h3>The Big Mistake</h3>
    <blockquote>
     "The big mistake that men make is that when they turn thirteen or fourteen and all of a sudden they've reached puberty, they believe that they like women. Actually, you're just horny. It doesn't mean you like women any more at twenty-one than you did at ten." - Anonymous
    </blockquote>
    <p>This quote summarizes the confusion that many young men face when it comes to their attraction towards women. It is natural for teenagers to have an increased sex drive during puberty, but it does not necessarily mean that they are ready for emotional or physical relationships with women. However, society puts a lot of pressure on men to be sexually active and often romantically involved with women from a young age. This pressure can cause confusion and lead to wrong decisions.</p>

    <h3>The Difference Between Being Horny and Being Into Women</h3>
    <ol>
     <li><strong>Emotional Connection:</strong> Being into women involves more than just sexual attraction. It involves emotional connection and compatibility. A person who is into women seeks to form a meaningful relationship with a woman based on common interests, shared values and mutual respect.</li>
     <li><strong>Physical Connection:</strong> Being into women also involves physical attraction. However, physical attraction alone does not necessarily mean that a person is into women. A person who is into women seeks to connect with their bodies in a meaningful and respectful way. They do not view women as mere objects of sexual desire.</li>
     <li><strong>Respect:</strong> Being into women also involves respect. A person who is into women respects their boundaries, feelings and opinions. They do not use their sexual desires as an excuse to disrespect or objectify women.</li>
    </ol>
