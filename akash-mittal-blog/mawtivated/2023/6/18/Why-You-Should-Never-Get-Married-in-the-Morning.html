    <h2>An Inspiring Story: How Waiting Until Evening Saved One Couple's Marriage</h2>
    <p>Ben and Sarah had been together for five years when they decided to tie the knot. They planned a beautiful outdoor wedding for the morning of June 1st.</p>
    <p>Everything seemed perfect until the night before the wedding. Ben went out with his groomsmen for a bachelor party, and Sarah headed to a bachelorette party with her girlfriends.</p>
    <p>Both parties got out of hand, and by the time the morning came around, Ben and Sarah were not quite themselves. They barely made it through their vows and spent the rest of the day arguing and feeling sick. It was not the romantic start to their marriage that they had envisioned.</p>
    <p>They decided to have a quiet dinner that evening to try to salvage the night. As they sat across from each other, calm and relaxed, they realized that waiting until evening to get married would have been a much better choice. They both wished they had done it differently.</p>

    <h2>The Author's Story: Paul Hornung's Perspective</h2>
    <p>Paul Hornung is a former NFL player and broadcaster who famously said, "Never get married in the morning - you never know who you might meet that night." This quote has become a bit of a joke, but Hornung speaks from experience.</p>
    <p>He got married in the morning in 1958 and spent the rest of the day celebrating with friends and family. But as the night wore on, he found himself drawn to one of his old flames. He ended up cheating on his new wife and regretted it for years.</p>
    <p>While Hornung's actions were wrong, his sentiment is understandable. Weddings are emotional and stressful, and sometimes the pressure can lead to poor decisions. For some people, waiting until the evening can provide a more relaxed and intimate setting to exchange vows.</p>
