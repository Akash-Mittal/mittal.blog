   <p class="story">Growing up in a family on the ragged edges of the middle class was not easy for Elizabeth Warren. Her parents worked hard to make ends meet â€“ her dad sold carpeting and ended up as a maintenance man after having a heart attack, and her mom worked the phones at Sears so they could hang on to their house. But despite the challenges they faced, Warren learned a valuable lesson from her parents: the power of perseverance.</p>
   <p>With determination and hard work, Elizabeth Warren went on to become a Harvard law professor, US Senator, and advocate for consumer protection. And she did it all while raising a family and fighting for the rights of everyday Americans. Her story is an inspiring example of what can be achieved when we refuse to give up in the face of adversity.</p>

   <p class="anecdote">When Warren was young, she was determined to go to college, but her family couldn't afford it. However, she didn't let that stop her. She worked as a waitress and babysitter to save money and eventually attended college on a debate scholarship. Her willingness to work hard and find creative solutions to problems allowed her to achieve her goals.</p>
   <p class="anecdote">When Warren was advocating for the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, she faced a lot of pushback from Wall Street and big banks. However, she didn't give up on the fight. She remained committed to the cause and ultimately played a key role in creating the bureau, which has since returned billions of dollars to consumers who were victims of financial scams and abuses.</p>
