  <h1>The Natural Flights of the Human Mind: From Hope to Hope</h1></br> <img src="images/The-Natural-Flights-of-the-Human-Mind-From-Hope-to-Hope.jpeg" alt="+The-Natural-Flights-of-the-Human-Mind-From-Hope-to-Hope+"></br>
  <p>Once upon a time, there was a man named John. John was always dreaming and scheming about his future. He had big ambitions and always felt like he wasn't satisfied with what he had in the present. One day, John realized that he was always chasing after the next big thing and never really took the time to enjoy the moment. He decided to change his ways and started to focus on the present. He found that he was much happier and fulfilled when he took the time to appreciate what he had.</p>
  <blockquote>
   The mind is never satisfied with the objects immediately before it, but is always breaking away from the present moment, and losing itself in schemes of future felicity...
  </blockquote>
  <p>The above quote by Samuel Johnson perfectly describes John's former way of thinking. The human mind has a tendency to always want more and to constantly chase after new things. We are never satisfied with the present moment and are always looking towards the future.</p>
