   <p>A nation that is capable of nuclear warfare poses a threat not only to its neighbors but also to the entire world. Ehud Olmert, an Israeli politician who served as the 12th Prime Minister of Israel, shares his thoughts on why it is critical that Iran should not possess nuclear weapons.</p>

    <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
    <p>The story of Israel's first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, who was faced with a similar situation in the early years of the state, inspires us even today. Ben-Gurion realized that the nascent state of Israel could not survive if it did not have a strong military defense. Despite the objections of many, he embarked on a project to develop Israel's own nuclear capability. His vision and determination have successfully deterred potential aggressors and secured the existence of Israel for over 70 years.</p>

    <h2>A Danger to the World</h2>
    <p>Iran's extremist government, led by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has been pursuing a nuclear program for decades. The country is known to support terrorist organizations and has repeatedly threatened Israel and its Arab neighbors. If Iran acquires nuclear weapons, it would destabilize the entire Middle East and pose a grave threat to global peace and security. Even Iran's neighboring countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates will be left with no choice other than to pursue their own nuclear deterrent against Iran.</p>
    <ul>
     <li><strong>Fact:</strong> Khamenei's government has repeatedly called for Israel's annihilation and denies the Holocaust, thus legitimizing the use of their own nuclear weapons as a means to that end.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Global Opinion Against Nuclear Iran</h2>
    <p>Most nations of the world agree that Iran should never be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was signed in 2015 between Iran and five permanent members of the United Nations, including the United States, Russia, China, France, and the United Kingdom, to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Israel and many moderate Arab countries, such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, strongly opposed the agreement as it was seen as a weak and unenforceable attempt to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear power.</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>"There is a Western world. There is America. There is Great Britain and Germany and France and Russia and China and other nations. I doubt that there is one country amongst those I mentioned which has a desire to see Iran, with its fundamentalist, Islamic, extremist government, possessing nuclear weapons." - Ehud Olmert</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>An Example of Iranian Aggression</h2>
    <p>In recent years, Iran has expanded its influence in the region, arming proxy groups in Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq. The Houthi rebels in Yemen, who receive military and financial support from Iran, have been launching missile attacks against Saudi Arabia, a close ally of the United States. In 2019, a drone and missile attack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities was traced back to Iran.</p>
    <p>These incidents are examples that demonstrate that a nuclear Iran will not only pose a direct threat to its neighbors and US allies but also to world peace.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>A nuclear Iran is not only a threat to its immediate neighbors but also to the world as a whole.</li>
     <li>The world must stand united against Iran's nuclear ambitions and urge it to abandon its nuclear program.</li>
     <li>If Iran is allowed to acquire nuclear weapons, it is only a matter of time before other nations in the region follow suit in an arms race that will destabilize the Middle East and increase the threat of global nuclear war.</li>
