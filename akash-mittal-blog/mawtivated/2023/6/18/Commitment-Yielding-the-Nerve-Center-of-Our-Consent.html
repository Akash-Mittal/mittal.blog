   <p>When I was working on my first book, I would wake up early every morning to work on it. It was hard work, and sometimes I didn't feel like I was getting anywhere. But I made a commitment to myself to finish it, and that gave me the motivation to push through the doubts and the setbacks.</p>
   <p>Another time, I was working with a group of volunteers to help build homes for the homeless. It was tough physical work, and there were times when I felt like giving up. But I made a commitment to see it through, and that helped me find the strength and the determination to keep going.</p>
