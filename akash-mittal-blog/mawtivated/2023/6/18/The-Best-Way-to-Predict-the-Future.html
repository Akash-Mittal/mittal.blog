   <h3>An Inspiring Story</h3>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>It was a typical day in the life of Kevin, a software engineer in a tech company. He was known for his extraordinary coding skills and had been working on a project for months. One day, while having lunch with his colleagues, he overheard two managers discussing the future of the company. They were worried about the company's future as they were facing stiff competition from rivals.</p>
   <p>This conversation made Kevin ponder about his future in the company. He wondered, "What would my job look like in the future? Would I still be relevant? Would my skills be outdated?" He went back to his workplace and started researching emerging technologies, trying to predict which skills would be in demand in the future. He created a plan to upgrade his skills, and eventually became one of the most valuable resources in the company. His prediction about the future not only secured his job, but also helped the company grow.</p>
   <p>The story of Kevin highlights the importance of creating the future. It is a common belief that the future is uncertain and cannot be predicted. However, the truth is, our actions today determine our future. We have the power to shape the future and make it what we want it to be.</p><!--Personal Anecdote-->
   <p>My personal experience is a testament to this fact. A few years ago, I wanted to start my own business, but was not sure if it would be successful. However, I took the leap of faith and started working towards my goal. I did extensive research, created a solid business plan, and took calculated risks. Today, my business is thriving and I am glad I created my own future.</p>
