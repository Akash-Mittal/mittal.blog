   <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
   <p>In my career as a biographer, I have written about some of the most famous geniuses in history, from Benjamin Franklin to Albert Einstein. While each subject has their own unique story, there is one common theme that I have discovered: they are all human just like you and me.</p>
   <p>One particular biography that comes to mind is my work on Steve Jobs. While Jobs was often portrayed as a tech visionary and an enigmatic figure, my research showed a more personal side to him. He was a flawed human being, just like the rest of us. He had his share of highs and lows, successes and failures.</p>
   <p>But what makes Jobs, or any other genius, stand out is their ability to persevere through all the hardships, and to use their innate talent and skills to create something that changes the world. In Jobs's case, it was the Apple computer, the iPhone, and the many other innovations he brought to the tech industry.</p>
   <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
   <p>Through my numerous biographies, I have come across many personal anecdotes and case studies that illustrate the humanity of geniuses. For instance, in my biography of Leonardo da Vinci, I discovered that he suffered from bouts of depression and anxiety, a fact that was often overlooked in history books. In fact, his notebooks are filled with observations about the human condition and how to deal with it.</p>
   <p>In my biography of Franklin, I found out that he had several affairs during his lifetime, yet he still managed to become one of the most accomplished statesmen and scientists in American history. His resilience and dedication to improving himself and his society are what made him a genius.</p>
   <p>These personal anecdotes and case studies show that even geniuses are not perfect. They have their own struggles and challenges, but they have a unique ability to rise above them and make a lasting impact on the world.</p>
   <h2>Practical Tips for Discovering the Human Side of Geniuses</h2>
   <p>If you are interested in discovering the human side of geniuses, here are some practical tips:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Read biographies written by reputable and well-researched authors, such as myself (shameless plug).</li>
    <li>Look beyond the headlines and myths, and try to find the real person behind the public image.</li>
    <li>Pay attention to the personal details, such as their relationships, struggles, and passions. These are often the key to understanding their genius.</li>
    <li>Don't be afraid to question the popular narrative and come to your own conclusions. Remember, even experts can be wrong.</li>
   </ul>
   <blockquote>
    "Geniuses are human beings who just happen to have an extraordinary talent or drive. They are not superhuman, and they should not be worshipped as such. By discovering their humanity, we can learn from them and be inspired to achieve greatness ourselves."<span class="highlight">Walter Isaacson</span>
