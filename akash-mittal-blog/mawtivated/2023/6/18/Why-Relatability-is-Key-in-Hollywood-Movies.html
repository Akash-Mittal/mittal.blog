  <p>Have you ever watched a movie and thought to yourself, "I cannot relate to this at all"? This is a problem for many people when it comes to Hollywood movies. The industry is saturated with films featuring larger-than-life characters or unrealistic scenarios that the average person just can't relate to. However, in recent years, there has been a push for more relatable content in Hollywood. Let's explore why relatability is key in Hollywood movies and how it can make a big impact on audiences.</p>
  <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
  <p>Kim Cattrall is a prime example of why relatable characters are so important in Hollywood. She was known for her role in the popular TV show "Sex and the City," where she played the confident and successful character of Samantha. However, when she was offered the role, she initially turned it down because she didn't relate to the character. It wasn't until she was convinced to look at the character in a different way, that she realized Samantha was a complex character with many layers. This allowed her to give an authentic performance that resonated with audiences.</p>
