    <p>Once upon a time, there was a man named John who lived in a small village. John was an excellent carpenter and had his own business. He had a beautiful wife and two lovely children. His life was perfect until the day he lost everything in a fire that destroyed his house and his carpentry workshop. John was devastated and didn't know what to do.</p>
    <p>He went to the village elder and asked for help. The elder told him, "I can't predict the future, but I can tell you that you have two choices. You can give up and accept your defeat, or you can use this as an opportunity to start again and create something even better."</p>
    <p>John decided to take the elder's advice and started again. He borrowed some money from his friends and built a new workshop. He worked hard and created even more beautiful furniture than before. His reputation grew, and he soon had more work than he could handle. He hired some workers and expanded his business. In a few years, he became the most successful carpenter in the village.</p>
    <p>This story teaches us that we can't predict the future, but we can control how we react to it. We can choose to give up or to take it as an opportunity to create something better.</p>
