    <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time, there was a couple that appeared to have a perfect relationship. They were kind to each other, never argued, and seemed to have a deep love for each other. However, one day the woman received some news that she was not happy about. She went to her partner to discuss it, and instead of comforting her, he dismissed her feelings and left her feeling hurt and angry. At that moment, she realized that his lack of anger meant that he didn't care enough about her to get upset. It was in that moment that she understood the importance of anger in love.</p>

    <h2>Edward Abbey's Background</h2>
    <p>Edward Abbey was an American author and environmental activist who believed in the power of anger. He is famous for his book "Desert Solitaire", which describes his experiences as a park ranger in the deserts of the American Southwest. He used his writing to raise awareness about environmental issues, and he believed that anger was a necessary tool in fighting for what you believed in. Abbey believed that love without anger was not true love, but rather a shallow and meaningless affection.</p>
