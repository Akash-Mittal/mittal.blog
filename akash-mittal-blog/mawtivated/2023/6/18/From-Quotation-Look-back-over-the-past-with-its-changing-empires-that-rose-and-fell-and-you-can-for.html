    <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
    <p>In the late 1800s, a young entrepreneur named Thomas Edison experienced repeated failures while trying to invent a workable incandescent lightbulb. Despite years of setbacks and discouragement, Edison refused to give up. He famously said, "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work." Eventually, Edison's persistence paid off, and he successfully created a long-lasting light source that revolutionized the world.</p>
    <p>Edison's story illustrates the power of looking back at history to inform our decisions and actions in the present and future. By learning from the successes and failures of those who came before us, we can avoid repeating the same mistakes and identify new opportunities for growth and progress.</p>
