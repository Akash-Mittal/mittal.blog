   <p>There was a man who lived in a small village in India. He was known for his unique pottery skills and was admired by everyone in the village. One day, a potter from a nearby town visited the man and offered him a deal. The deal was to copy the man's pottery designs and sell them in the market for profit.</p>
   <p>The man thought about the offer for a while and finally decided to reject it. He believed that his pottery was unique and could not be imitated. The potter from the nearby town was disappointed but left the village.</p>
   <p>Years passed by, and the man continued to make his unique pottery designs. His pottery became famous not just in the village but in nearby towns and cities as well. He was even invited to exhibit his pottery at an international event.</p>
   <p>The potter from the nearby town, on the other hand, copied the man's designs and sold them in the market. However, he soon realized that his pottery was not as popular as the man's. His pottery lacked the uniqueness and originality that the man's pottery had. He regretted his decision to copy the man's designs and wished that he had created something of his own.</p>
   <blockquote>
    In everything truth surpasses the imitation and copy.
   </blockquote>
   <p>This story beautifully illustrates the power of originality. The man in the story knew the value of his unique pottery designs and did not compromise on it. His originality not only earned him recognition but also gave him the satisfaction that he had created something unique and valuable.</p>
