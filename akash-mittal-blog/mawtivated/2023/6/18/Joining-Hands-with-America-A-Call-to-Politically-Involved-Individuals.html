  <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
  <p>During the civil rights era, African Americans were fighting for their rights and freedom. Martin Luther King Jr. was one of the most well-known civil rights activists during that time. He saw the injustices that were happening and knew that something had to change. He saw that change could not happen alone and that he needed to join hands with others to create a movement. The civil rights movement was not just about African Americans, but also about joining hands with people of all races, backgrounds, and beliefs to fight for a better future.</p>
  <h2>Author Background</h2>
