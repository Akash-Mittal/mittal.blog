   <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
   <p>Once upon a time, there was a man named Josh McDowell. Josh was a skeptic who didn't believe in Christianity. He thought it was a myth and a hoax. But one day, he decided to investigate the truth about Jesus Christ. He read the Bible, he talked to Christians, and he examined the evidence. And guess what? He found out that Jesus Christ was real, He was God, and He had the power to raise Himself from the dead. Josh was amazed, and he became a Christian. He realized that the unique claim of Jesus Christ was the most important and extraordinary claim in the history of religion.</p>
   <h2>The Power to Raise Himself from the Dead</h2>
   <p>What did Jesus Christ claim about Himself? He claimed that He was the Son of God, that He was the way, the truth, and the life, and that He had the power to raise Himself from the dead. This is a unique claim that separates Jesus from all other religious leaders and figures. No other prophet, guru, or messiah ever made such a bold and outrageous statement. They all died and remained dead. But Jesus died and rose again. He proved His claim by appearing to His disciples and hundreds of witnesses, by fulfilling the prophecies of the Old Testament, and by transforming the lives of millions of people.</p>
   <h2>His Followers Would be Raised from the Dead</h2>
   <p>What did Jesus Christ offer to His followers? He offered them eternal life, forgiveness of sins, and the hope of resurrection. He promised that whoever believed in Him would not perish but have everlasting life. He assured them that He was going to prepare a place for them in heaven and that He would come back to take them with Him. He comforted them with the fact that death was not the end, but the beginning of a new life with Him. This is a unique offer that no other religion can match or surpass. They all offer some kind of paradise or nirvana, but they don't offer a personal relationship with God, a secure salvation, or a bodily resurrection.</p>
   <h2>The Importance of His Claim</h2>
   <p>Why is the unique claim of Jesus Christ important? It is important because it reveals three crucial truths about God, ourselves, and the world.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>God is love and justice. He loves us so much that He sent His Son to die for us and to conquer death for us. He also judges us by our response to His Son. If we believe in Him, we are saved; if we reject Him, we are condemned.</li>
    <li>We are sinners and need a Savior. We cannot save ourselves by our good works, our religion, or our philosophy. We need the grace and mercy of God through Jesus Christ.</li>
    <li>The world is fallen and needs redemption. It is not a perfect place, and it cannot be fixed by human efforts alone. It needs the power and wisdom of God to transform it.</li>
   </ul>
   <blockquote>
    "I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: 'I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept His claim to be God.' That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic – on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg – or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut Him up for a fool, you can spit at Him and kill Him as a demon or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronising nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to."
   </blockquote><em>C. S. Lewis, Mere Christianity</em>
   <h2>The Practical Implications of His Claim</h2>
   <p>What are the practical implications of the unique claim of Jesus Christ? They are numerous and profound.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>We need to believe in Him and follow Him as our Lord and Savior. This means acknowledging our sins, repenting of them, and trusting in His sacrifice for our forgiveness and salvation. It also means obeying His commands, loving God and others, and sharing the good news with others.</li>
    <li>We need to grow in our knowledge and love of Him. This means studying His Word, praying to Him, worshiping Him, serving Him, and fellowshipping with other believers.</li>
    <li>We need to wait for His return and live in hope and holiness. This means living in the world but not of the world, resisting temptation, enduring persecution, and doing good to all.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>The Call to Action</h2>
   <p>What is the call to action? It is to examine the evidence for and against the unique claim of Jesus Christ, and to make a personal decision based on reason and faith. It is to ask yourself the following questions:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Is Jesus Christ a liar, a lunatic, or the Lord?</li>
    <li>Did Jesus Christ really rise from the dead?</li>
    <li>What does Jesus Christ offer that no other religion or philosophy can offer?</li>
    <li>What does it mean to believe in and follow Jesus Christ?</li>
    <li>What is the cost and the reward of being a disciple of Jesus Christ?</li>
   </ul>
   <blockquote>
    "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."
