   <p>Mark Ruffalo is known for his role as the Incredible Hulk in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but he is also a passionate advocate for the environment and public health. In particular, he has been outspoken about the dangers of fracking, a method of extracting natural gas from shale rock that has been linked to contamination of water, air, and soil.</p>
   <h2>A Personal Connection</h2>
   <p>Ruffalo's interest in fracking began when he learned that it was happening in his home state of New York. He was shocked to find out that the natural gas industry had been lobbying hard to allow fracking in the state, despite concerns from many residents and environmental groups.</p>
   <blockquote>
    "I started getting involved when I saw what was happening in my own backyard," Ruffalo says. "I quickly realized that this was a national issue, and that there were people all over the country who were fighting against it."
   </blockquote>
   <p>Ruffalo joined forces with organizations like Food &amp; Water Watch, Americans Against Fracking, and Environmental Working Group to raise awareness about the risks of fracking and push for a ban on the practice. He even testified before Congress about the need for stronger regulations to protect public health.</p>
   <h2>Making a Difference</h2>
   <p>Ruffalo's activism has had a significant impact on the public conversation around fracking. He has used his star power and social media presence to reach millions of people with his message, and has helped to mobilize a growing movement of concerned citizens and environmentalists.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>He appeared in the documentary film "Gasland Part II," which exposed the devastating effects of fracking on local communities.</li>
    <li>He spoke at the People's Climate March in New York City, addressing a crowd of over 300,000 people.</li>
    <li>He teamed up with director Josh Fox to create "Dear Governor Cuomo," a short film that urged the New York governor to ban fracking in the state.</li>
   </ul>
   <blockquote>
    "It's really important to me to use my platform for something positive," Ruffalo says. "I want to make a difference and help protect people and the planet."
   </blockquote>
   <h2>Looking Toward the Future</h2>
   <p>Despite the progress that has been made in the fight against fracking, Ruffalo knows that there is still much work to be done. The natural gas industry continues to push for expanded use of fracking, even as more and more people speak out against it.</p>
   <p>However, Ruffalo remains optimistic that we can transition to a cleaner, more sustainable energy system. He points to the rapid growth of the renewable energy sector, as well as the increasing awareness of the environmental and health risks associated with fossil fuels.</p>
   <blockquote>
    "We need to keep pushing for change, and that means supporting green energy and speaking out against practices like fracking that hurt our communities and our planet," Ruffalo says. "I truly believe that we can create a better future for everyone if we work together."
