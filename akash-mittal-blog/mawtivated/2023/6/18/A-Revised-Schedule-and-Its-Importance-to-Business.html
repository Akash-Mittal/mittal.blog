    <p>Have you ever felt stuck in your business and unable to move forward?</p>
    <p>It happens to even the most successful entrepreneurs. But what sets them apart is their ability to adapt and revise their schedules like athletes do when faced with a new season, or artists when given a new canvas.</p>
    <p>Let me share with you a story that inspired this article.</p>
    <blockquote>
     "When I was the CEO of Lockheed Martin, we were assigned a project with the U.S. government that had some delays, and as a result, the milestones had to be redefined. During a review meeting, my team and I realized that this revised schedule had the potential to turn things around and deliver the project faster than the original one. The only difference was that it required us to change our approach and view the revised schedule as a new opportunity rather than a setback. This experience taught me the importance of having a positive attitude towards revisions and how it can help businesses thrive."
    </blockquote>
    <p>The author of this quote, Norman Ralph Augustine, is a prominent American engineer and businessman who has served as the CEO of various aerospace companies throughout his career.</p>
