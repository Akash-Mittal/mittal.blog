   <p class="subtitle">Inspiring story of a woman who broke stereotypes and achieved success</p>
   <p>There was once a woman named Mary. She was raised in a family where women were expected to stay at home, raise children, and take care of the household. Mary, however, had a different dream. She wanted to become a doctor and help people. Despite the opposition and disapproval of her family, Mary went ahead and pursued her dream. She worked hard, studied long hours, and faced numerous challenges. But she persevered and finally became a doctor.</p>
   <p>Mary's story is just one among many such stories of women who have broken the stereotypes and achieved success in their lives. Women of the previous generations were expected to stay at home and take care of the family. They were not supposed to work or pursue a career. But times have changed, and so have the attitudes towards women's roles in society.</p>
   <h2 class="section-heading">Jackie Kennedy: A Role Model for Women</h2>
   <p>One such woman who challenged the stereotypes and paved the way for future generations was Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. She was the wife of President John F. Kennedy and First Lady of the United States. Despite being in the public eye and facing constant scrutiny, she managed to carve her own identity and pursue her interests and passions.</p>
   <blockquote class="quote">
    "What is sad for women of my generation is that they weren't supposed to work if they had families. What were they going to do when the children are grown - watch the raindrops coming down the window pane?" - Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis
   </blockquote>
   <p>Jackie Kennedy was a history major and a lover of the arts. She pursued a career in journalism and worked as an editor at Doubleday Publishing. She also became an accomplished equestrian and pursued her passion for horse riding. Her life and achievements are a testament to the fact that women can have successful careers and pursue their interests, even if they have families.</p>
   <h2 class="section-heading">Breaking the Myths about Women and Work</h2>
   <p>Despite the progress made in the past few decades, there are still many myths and stereotypes about women and work. Let's take a look at some of the most common ones.</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Myth #1:</strong> Women who work don't care about their families.</li>
    <li><strong>Myth #2:</strong> Women can't have successful careers and a family at the same time.</li>
    <li><strong>Myth #3:</strong> Women are not as committed or motivated as men when it comes to work.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>These myths are not only unfair but also untrue. Women who work care deeply about their families and are often driven by the desire to provide a better life for them. They can have successful careers and a family at the same time. And women are just as committed and motivated as men when it comes to work.</p>
