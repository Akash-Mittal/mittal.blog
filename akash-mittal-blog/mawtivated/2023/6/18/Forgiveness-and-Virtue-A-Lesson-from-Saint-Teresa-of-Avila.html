    <p>They say that forgiveness is a virtue, but what does it really mean to be forgiven? For Saint Teresa of Avila, forgiveness comes with a deep understanding of the goodness in people. She once said, "God has been very good to me, for I never dwell upon anything wrong which a person has done, so as to remember it afterwards. If I do remember it, I always see some other virtue in that person."</p>
    <p>Her quote is a testament to her faith and her ability to forgive others, even in the worst of circumstances. Saint Teresa believed that no one is entirely bad, and that everyone is capable of doing good things. Her words remind us that forgiveness is not just about letting go of past hurt, but also about seeing the good in others and acknowledging their virtues.</p>
    <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
    <p>There is a story about Saint Teresa that illustrates this point perfectly. One day, a sister from her monastery was spreading rumors about her, saying that she was not really as holy as people thought. The rumor spread quickly, and before long, many people in the community began to doubt her sincerity.</p>
    <p>Saint Teresa, however, did not let the rumors get to her. Instead, she simply said, "Let her say what she will, I shall still be Theresa of Jesus, and though she was to make all the devils in hell speak against me, I would still trust in God."\</p>
    <p>This story shows how Saint Teresa's faith enabled her to forgive and move on from hurtful words. She recognized that the sister who spread the rumors was not entirely bad, and that she also had virtues that she could appreciate. By focusing on the good in the person, Saint Teresa was able to forgive her and move on from the situation.</p>
