    <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
    <p>A young boy, Joshua, was living in a small village in Africa. He was always curious about the world beyond his village, but had no means to explore it due to his family's limited resources. One day, a group of volunteers came to his village and brought with them a library filled with books from around the world. Joshua's eyes lit up with joy as he flipped through the pages, discovering new worlds and ideas. It was then that he realized the power of knowledge, and how it can transform a person's life. Fast forward a few years, Joshua is now a successful doctor, giving back to his community and inspiring young minds to pursue their dreams.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>As society evolves, so does the way we gather and process information. In today's highly developed society, we are constantly bombarded with information from various sources. The question then arises, what methodological representation should we apply to this vast amount of knowledge to make sense of it all?</p>
    <blockquote>
     "If we wish to discuss knowledge in the most highly developed contemporary society, we must answer the preliminary question of what methodological representation to apply to that society." - Jean-Francois Lyotard
    </blockquote>
    <p>In this article, we will explore the different approaches to understanding information in contemporary society, and how we can use it to our advantage.</p>

    <h2>Background of Jean-Francois Lyotard</h2>
    <p>Jean-Francois Lyotard was a French philosopher who played a significant role in shaping postmodernist thought. His works focused on the changes in society brought about by technology, and the impact it had on our perceptions of knowledge. He believed that knowledge should not be restricted to the traditional institutional structures, but rather should be seen as a fluid and dynamic concept.</p>

    <h2>Examples of Methodological Representation</h2>
    <ul>
     <li><b>Scientific Method:</b> This approach relies on empirical evidence and experimentation to establish knowledge. It is often used in scientific fields such as physics, chemistry, and biology.</li>
     <li><b>Social Science Research:</b> This approach involves the study of human behavior and social interactions, and relies on various research methods such as surveys, interviews, and case studies.</li>
     <li><b>Critical Theory:</b> This approach is used to analyze and critique society and culture, and is often used in fields such as literature and media studies.</li>
     <li><b>Postmodernism:</b> This approach challenges the idea of a universal knowledge and instead sees knowledge as subjective and context-dependent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses, and can be used depending on the context and purpose of the study.</p>

    <p>As a college student, I was struggling to find a clear path for my future. I decided to take a gap year and travel the world to gain more perspective and knowledge about different cultures. Along the way, I met people from all walks of life who had varied interests and passions. It was then that I realized the importance of gaining knowledge not just for career purposes, but also to broaden one's horizons and deepen one's understanding of the world we live in.</p>
