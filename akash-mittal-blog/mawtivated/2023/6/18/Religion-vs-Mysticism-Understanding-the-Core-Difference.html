     <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
     <p>There once was a man who had great faith in his religion. He followed all the rituals and traditions, and felt a deep connection with his God through his prayers and worship. However, he always felt like something was missing. He yearned for a deeper understanding of his faith and a more profound connection with the divine. One day, he met a mystic who introduced him to a new way of looking at spirituality. The man was hesitant at first, but soon realized that mysticism was the missing piece he had been searching for all along.</p>

     <h2>Author Background - Henri Bergson</h2>
     <p>Henri Bergson was a French philosopher who believed that intuition and experience were the keys to understanding reality and spirituality. He believed that the rational mind could only take us so far, and that we needed to tap into our intuition and emotions to truly understand the world and ourselves. His ideas have been influential in both philosophy and spirituality.</p>

     <h2>Understanding the Core Difference</h2>
     <p>Religion and mysticism are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same thing. Religion is like the popularization of spirituality - it provides a structured set of beliefs, rituals, and traditions that can help people connect with the divine. Mysticism, on the other hand, is more personal and experiential. It is about tapping into your intuition and experiencing a direct connection with the divine without the need for intermediaries like priests, holy texts, or religious icons.</p>
     <p>Religion can be seen as a way to connect with the divine through a set of prescribed rules and beliefs, while mysticism is about connecting with the divine in a more direct and personal way. It is important to note that one is not necessarily better than the other - it is a matter of personal preference and temperament.</p>
     <blockquote>
      "Mysticism is the art of union with Reality. The mystic is a person who has attained that union in greater or less degree; or one who aims at and believes in such attainment." - Evelyn Underhill
