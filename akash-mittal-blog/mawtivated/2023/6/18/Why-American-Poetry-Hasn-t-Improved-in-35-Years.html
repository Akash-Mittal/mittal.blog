    <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
    <p>When Robert Morgan was in his early twenties, he was working as a carpenter in North Carolina. He had always loved poetry, but had never pursued it seriously. One day, he decided to show a poem he had written to a professor he knew at the local university. The professor read the poem, and told him that it was good.</p>
    <p>That was all the encouragement Robert needed. He started reading more poetry, attending workshops, and honing his craft. Today, Robert Morgan is a highly respected poet with numerous awards and publications to his name.</p>
    <p>Robert's story may be inspiring, but unfortunately, it is not representative of the state of American poetry as a whole.</p>

    <h2>The Impact of Creative Writing Programs</h2>
    <p>While Robert's story may be an outlier, it does highlight the importance of being exposed to good poetry and receiving constructive criticism. This is why one would expect creative writing programs, which have become ubiquitous in recent decades, to have a positive impact on American poetry.</p>
    <p>Oddly enough, however, this does not seem to be the case. While creative writing programs have undoubtedly been beneficial for fiction writing, poetry has remained relatively stagnant.</p>
    <p>There are a number of reasons for this. One is the fact that poetry tends to be more personal, and therefore more difficult to teach. Another is the fact that many creative writing programs tend to focus on the "craft" of writing, rather than the actual content of the poetry itself.</p>
    <p>One of the major issues, however, is the fact that creative writing programs tend to generate a certain homogeneity in poetry. Because students are often exposed to the same teachers and the same peer group, they tend to produce similar types of poetry.</p>
    <p>This results in a kind of self-referential cycle, where poets are more concerned with impressing each other than with creating meaningful, impactful poetry.</p>

   <section id="personal-anecdotes">
    
    <p>As someone who has attended a creative writing program and has been immersed in the poetry world for a number of years, I can attest to the fact that there is a certain "sameness" to much of the poetry being produced. This is not to say that there aren't talented poets out there, but rather that the overall quality of American poetry has not improved much in recent decades.</p>
    <p>One of the reasons for this, I believe, is the pressure to conform to certain stylistic norms. For example, in many poetry workshops, there is a tendency to focus on "lyric" poetry, which is characterized by short, free-verse lines and a certain level of sentimentality. Poets who don't conform to this style are often marginalized.</p>
    <p>This leads to a kind of groupthink where poets are more concerned with "fitting in" than with pushing boundaries and exploring new forms and styles.</p>

   <section id="examples">
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>Consider two of the most well-known American poets of the late 20th century: Billy Collins and Mary Oliver. While both are undoubtedly talented, their poetry is characterized by a certain whimsical sentimentality that has become all too common in American poetry.</li>
     <li>On the other hand, consider poets like Wallace Stevens or Sylvia Plath. These poets pushed boundaries and explored new forms and styles, creating poetry that was impactful and meaningful.</li>
     <li>The difference between these poets and many of the poets being produced today is that they weren't afraid to take risks and challenge convention. They created poetry that was bold and unique, rather than conforming to a certain stylistic norm.</li>
    </ul>
   </section>
   <section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>So why hasn't American poetry improved in 35 years?</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Creative writing programs, while beneficial for fiction, have not had a positive impact on poetry.</li>
     <li>The pressure to conform to certain stylistic norms has created a kind of groupthink that stifles creativity.</li>
     <li>There has been a lack of innovation and risk-taking in American poetry in recent decades, resulting in a stagnant state of poetry.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>While this may sound bleak, there is still hope for American poetry. By encouraging young poets to take risks and explore new forms and styles, we can push the boundaries of what is possible in poetry, and create a more vibrant and meaningful culture.</p>
