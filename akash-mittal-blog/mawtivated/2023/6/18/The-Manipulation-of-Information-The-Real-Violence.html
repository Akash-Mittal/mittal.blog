   <p>There is an old, inspiring story from the Cherokee tribe that talks about the two wolves inside us: one is good, full of love, compassion, and kindness; the other is evil, full of anger, greed, and resentment. The story goes that the wolf that wins is the one that we feed. But when it comes to the world we live in, there is an ongoing battle between these two wolves, and we are not fully aware of it.</p>
   <p>Author Bryant McGill is well-aware of this. He speaks of the "real violence" that happens in our societies through the manipulation of information. When we think about violence, we tend to think of physical harm, but the manipulation of information is a sneaky type of violence that we often overlook.</p>
   <p>The reality is that violence never starts with a punch or a gun, but with an idea that spreads like wildfire through manipulation. The real violence happens in the writing of history, in the records of the legal system, in the reporting of news, through the manipulation of social contracts, and the control of information.</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Writing of History</strong>: History tends to be biased because it is often written by the winners of wars and conflicts. History textbooks often paint a specific picture of events that is meant to support a certain narrative. This does not recognize the diversity of perspectives and experiences that can lead to a deeper understanding of what really happened.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal System</strong>: The legal system is supposed to be a mode of justice, but it is often flawed and not impartial. Laws are created by people with biases and power. Laws that are unfair or unjust often bring about violence and harm to marginalized groups. This system tends to punish the poorest and most vulnerable people while often letting the wealthy get away with their crimes.</li>
    <li><strong>Reporting of News</strong>: The media has a huge influence on the public's perception of different events. Sensationalism, misinformation, propaganda, and clickbait are used to gain attention. News outlets tend to lean towards a certain opinion or narrative, leaving the viewer or reader less informed.</li>
    <li><strong>Manipulation of Social Contracts</strong>: Social contracts are implicit agreements between people and their society. Societies operate on a set of agreed-upon values. However, these values are often manipulated by those in power to exclude or marginalize some groups. This can lead to discrimination and social unrest, which can in turn lead to physical violence.</li>
    <li><strong>Control of Information</strong>: Access to information is not always equal. Those who control information control the narrative. Information is used as a form of power and can lead to the perpetuation of cycles of oppression.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The manipulation of information is a dangerous game that can lead to violence and harm. So, what can we do to stop this violence?</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Be aware</strong>: It is important to stay alert to the manipulation of information in our daily lives. It is easy to fall into a trap of misinformation or bias without even realizing it.</li>
    <li><strong>Fact-checking</strong>: Verify the sources of information, and double-check the news reports we hear or read. This can help us distinguish between what is fact and what is fiction.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-checking and listening to different perspectives</strong>: This can help us develop a fuller and more nuanced understanding of events and the world we live in.</li>
    <li><strong>Speak up</strong>: It is important to speak up against violence and manipulation of information. Silence can lead to the perpetuation of this dangerous cycle.</li>
    <li><strong>Vote and participate in social actions</strong>: Participating in voting and social actions can help us make a positive impact in our community and ultimately fight against domination systems.</li>
   </ul>
   <blockquote>
    "The most violent element in society is ignorance." -Emma Goldman
   </blockquote>
   <p>In conclusion, it is important to recognize the real violence that happens with the manipulation of information. Our awareness of what is happening around us is critical to combat the ongoing cycle of violence. We must not only speak up, but we must actively work towards a more equitable and just society. We can start by fact-checking, listening to different perspectives, speaking up, and participating in community action.</p>
