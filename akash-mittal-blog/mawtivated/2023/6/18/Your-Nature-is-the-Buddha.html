    <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Siddhartha who grew up in a wealthy family. He had everything he wanted, but he felt empty inside. One day, he witnessed the suffering of old age, sickness, and death. This experience made him realize that everyone in the world is subject to suffering. He left his luxurious life and began to seek an end to this suffering.</p>
    <p>After years of searching, Siddhartha finally attained enlightenment under the Bodhi tree. He became known as the Buddha, meaning the awakened one. He taught that all living beings have the potential to become enlightened and experience lasting peace and happiness.</p>
