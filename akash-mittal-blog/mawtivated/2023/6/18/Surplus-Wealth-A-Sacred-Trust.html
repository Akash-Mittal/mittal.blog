  <h1>Surplus Wealth: A Sacred Trust</h1></br> <img src="images/Surplus-Wealth-A-Sacred-Trust.jpeg" alt="+Surplus-Wealth-A-Sacred-Trust+"></br>
  <p>Once upon a time, there was a man named John who had accumulated a great deal of wealth throughout his lifetime. He lived in a large mansion and had everything he could ever want, but he found himself feeling empty and unfulfilled.</p>
  <p>One day, John heard about a nearby community in need of a new school. Without hesitation, he donated a portion of his wealth to fund the construction of the school. As he watched it being built, John felt a sense of purpose and satisfaction that he had never felt before.</p>
  <p>This story highlights the important truth that surplus wealth is a sacred trust that should be used for the good of the community.</p>
  <h2>Author Background</h2>
  <p>Andrew Carnegie, a business magnate and philanthropist, famously stated that "surplus wealth is a sacred trust which its possessor is bound to administer in his lifetime for the good of the community." Carnegie believed that those who had amassed great wealth had a responsibility to use it to improve the lives of others.</p>
  <p>Carnegie himself was no stranger to wealth, having built a vast steel empire in the late 1800s. However, instead of hoarding his riches, he gave away a significant portion of his wealth to causes such as education, science, and the arts. His legacy continues to this day, with the Carnegie Corporation of New York, which has donated billions of dollars to promote world peace, education, and democracy.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Surplus Wealth</h2>
  <p>There are many examples of individuals and organizations that have used their surplus wealth to benefit society:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Bill and Melinda Gates have donated billions of dollars to improve healthcare and reduce poverty around the world</li>
   <li>Warren Buffett has pledged to give away 99% of his wealth to charitable causes</li>
   <li>The Rockefeller Foundation has funded initiatives to promote sustainable development, improve healthcare, and support social innovation</li>
   <li>Oprah Winfrey has donated millions of dollars to support education, healthcare, and disaster relief efforts</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>One of the most inspiring stories of surplus wealth comes from Chuck Feeney, the co-founder of Duty Free Shoppers. Despite being a billionaire, Feeney has lived a frugal lifestyle and given away over $8 billion to charitable causes, all while keeping it a secret from the public for many years.</p>
  <p>Feeney has said that his philosophy is based on the idea of "giving while living," which means that he wants to see the impact of his donations while he is still alive. He has funded initiatives such as education, healthcare, and peacebuilding in countries around the world, and his generosity has inspired others to follow in his footsteps.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In summary, surplus wealth is a sacred trust that should be used for the good of the community. Those who have the means to make a difference have a responsibility to do so, and there are countless examples of individuals and organizations that have made positive contributions to society through their philanthropy.</p>
