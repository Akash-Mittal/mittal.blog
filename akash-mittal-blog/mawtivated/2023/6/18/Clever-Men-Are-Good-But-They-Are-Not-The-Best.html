   <p>Once upon a time, there was an ordinary man named John. He lived an ordinary life, had an ordinary job, and did ordinary things. But John had a dream â€“ he wanted to do something extraordinary, something that would set him apart from others.</p>
   <blockquote>
    Clever men are good, but they are not the best. - Thomas Carlyle
   </blockquote>
   <p>John knew that he wasn't the smartest person in the world, but he also knew that he didn't have to be. He realized that cleverness alone wouldn't make him the best. He needed something else.</p>
   <p>So John started working on himself. He read books, attended seminars, and learned new skills. He tried new things and took risks. And slowly but surely, he started to see results.</p>
   <p>John realized that being the best wasn't about being the smartest or the most talented. It was about having the right mindset, the right attitude, and the willingness to keep improving.</p>
   <p>And so he did. John became successful in his career, started his own business, and even became a motivational speaker. He inspired others to overcome their fears and pursue their dreams.</p>
   <h2>The Story Behind Thomas Carlyle's Quote</h2>
   <p>Thomas Carlyle was a Scottish philosopher, writer, and historian who lived in the 19th century. He was known for his influential works on the French Revolution and for his critical stance on the Industrial Revolution.</p>
   <p>In his essay, "On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and The Heroic in History," Carlyle argued that history was shaped by great men and women who possessed extraordinary qualities. However, he also recognized that cleverness and intellect alone weren't enough to make someone a true hero.</p>
   <blockquote>
    It is the heart always that sees, before the head can see. - Thomas Carlyle
   </blockquote>
   <p>Carlyle believed that true heroes had a higher purpose and a sense of duty that drove them beyond their own self-interest. They were driven by a passion for excellence and a desire to make a positive impact on the world.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Ordinary People Becoming Extraordinary</h2>
   <p>John's story may seem like a fairy tale, but it's not unique. There are countless examples of ordinary people who have become extraordinary by changing their mindset, their attitude, and their actions.</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Oprah Winfrey</strong> - Oprah was born in poverty and suffered abuse as a child. But she didn't let her past define her. She worked hard, overcame obstacles, and eventually became one of the most successful talk show hosts and media moguls in the world.</li>
    <li><strong>Stephen Hawking</strong> - Hawking was diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease at the age of 21. Despite his physical limitations, he became a groundbreaking physicist and cosmologist, publishing numerous books and papers on the nature of the universe.</li>
    <li><strong>Nick Vujicic</strong> - Nick was born without arms or legs, but he didn't let that stop him from living a remarkable life. He became a motivational speaker, author, and evangelist, inspiring millions of people around the world with his message of hope and perseverance.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, clever men are good, but they are not the best. True excellence comes from having the right mindset, attitude, and actions. It comes from a sense of purpose and a desire to make a positive impact on the world.</p>
