   <p>There was a time in Tony Robbins' life when he was barely making ends meet. He was out of work, couldn't pay the rent, and had no idea how to get his life back on track. But one day, he made a simple decision that would change everything for him. He decided to take initiative.</p>
   <p>Robbins started by making a list of all the things he wanted to achieve in his life and began taking small steps toward those goals. He used his passion for helping others to create a successful career as a life coach, and over time, he built an empire that has helped millions of people achieve their own dreams.</p>
   <p>The key to Robbins' success was taking that first step and following through on his plans, no matter how daunting they seemed. He knew that it was up to him to take responsibility for his life and make things happen.</p>
   <h2>Why Initiative is Important for Success</h2>
   <p>Initiative is the foundation of success. Without it, we would simply go through life, waiting for things to happen to us. But when we take initiative, we become active participants in our own lives. We take control of our destinies and create the future we want.</p>
   <p>Initiative is especially important in today's fast-paced, rapidly changing world. If we don't take decisive action to stay ahead of the curve, we risk falling behind and losing our competitive edge. By taking initiative, we not only keep up with the times, we help to shape them.</p>

   <ol>
    <li>Identify what's holding you back. Is it fear, lack of resources, or simply not knowing where to start? Once you've identified the problem, you can start finding solutions.</li>
