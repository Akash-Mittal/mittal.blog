    <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
    <p>Many years ago, there was a man named John. He lived a simple life and was devoted to his religion. He believed every word from his religious text and followed them to the letter. He spent countless hours in prayer and meditation, hoping to receive divine guidance. One day, a wise old man visited him and asked him a question - "Do you truly believe in your religion or are you simply following it because everyone else does?" This question sparked something inside John. He began to question everything he knew about his religion and embarked on a journey to discover the truth. He read books, spoke to people from different religions, and went on pilgrimages. Eventually, he found his answer and it was not what he expected. He realized that religion, as he knew it, was not the absolute truth but rather a means of control and manipulation. He felt liberated and began to live his life without the constraints of dogma and tradition.</p>
    <h2 id="history">Author - Lucius Annaeus Seneca story or background</h2>
    <p>Lucius Annaeus Seneca was a Roman philosopher, statesman, and playwright who lived in the first century AD. He was one of the most influential thinkers of his time and is still revered by scholars and philosophers today. Seneca was known for his stoic philosophy, which emphasized the importance of reason, self-control, and virtue. He also wrote extensively about religion and its role in society. His famous quote, "Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by the rulers as useful," has been a topic of debate for centuries.</p>
    <h2 id="common">Common Belief</h2>
    <p>For many people, religion is a way of life. They believe every word of their religious text and follow the traditions and practices without question. Religion provides a sense of community, safety, and hope. It gives people a purpose and a reason to believe in something greater than themselves. For them, religion is the absolute truth and they cannot imagine their life without it.</p>
    <h2 id="wise">Wise Perspective</h2>
    <p>However, there are also people who take a more skeptical approach to religion. They question the validity and accuracy of religious texts and practices. They believe that religion is a product of human imagination and desire for control. For them, religion is false and cannot be proven or disproven. They prefer to rely on logic, reason, and scientific evidence rather than faith and belief.</p>
    <h2 id="rulers">Rulers' Use</h2>
    <p>In addition, there are those who believe that religion serves a more pragmatic purpose - to control the masses. Rulers and leaders throughout history have used religion as a tool to maintain power and influence over their people. They use it to justify their actions and to enforce laws and regulations. Religion gives them a way to manipulate and control the beliefs and behavior of their subjects.</p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>So, what is the truth about religion? The answer is not a simple one. Religion means different things to different people, and its role in society has been the subject of debate for centuries. However, there are a few points that we can take away from this discussion:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Religion can be a powerful force for good or for evil, depending on how it is used.</li>
     <li>Religion should not be blindly accepted or rejected but should be approached with an open mind and critical thinking.</li>
     <li>Ultimately, the truth about religion lies within each individual. It is up to us to decide what we believe and how we want to live our lives.</li>
