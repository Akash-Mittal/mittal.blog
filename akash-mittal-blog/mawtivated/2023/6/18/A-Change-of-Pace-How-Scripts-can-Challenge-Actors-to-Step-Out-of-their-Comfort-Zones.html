  <p>Albert Finney once said, "When I read the script, I liked the script very much and I thought it was a marvelous part for her, because I think it is a change of pace. I mean, we know how wonderful she is in romantic comedy." It's true that actors often get typecasted into specific roles or genres, but a well-written script can challenge them to step out of their comfort zones and showcase their versatility. Let me share with you an inspiring story that illustrates this point.</p>
  <p>Amy Adams had made a name for herself in Hollywood by starring in romantic comedies and dramas. She was known for playing the girl-next-door who is charming, sweet, and endearing. But in 2012, she was offered a role in a gritty crime thriller called "The Master". The script challenged her to completely transform herself into a manipulative, alcoholic, and emotionally damaged character named Peggy Dodd.</p>
  <p>Despite initial doubts about her ability to portray such a complex character, Adams dove headfirst into the role. She even went so far as to research the psychological effects of alcoholism and study the body language of people suffering from the disease. The result was a performance that earned critical acclaim and an Oscar nomination.</p>
  <p>Amy Adams' experience is just one example of how a well-written script can challenge actors to step out of their comfort zones. Let's explore this idea further with some personal anecdotes and case studies.</p>
