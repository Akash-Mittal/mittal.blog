    <p>When we think of education, we often picture a classroom filled with students and a teacher, or a library stacked with books. However, one of the most valuable education experiences is often overlooked - struggling to make a living. The lessons we learn through hardship can be some of the most powerful and long-lasting, shaping our character and giving us strength to overcome challenges. Author Wendell Phillips known for his advocacy work for the abolition of slavery in the United States, is a prime example of how struggle can lead to greater success.</p>
    <h2>The Story of Wendell Phillips</h2>
    <blockquote>
     "What is defeat? Nothing but education; nothing but the first step to something better."
    </blockquote>
    <p>Wendell Phillips was born into a wealthy family and had a comfortable upbringing. However, after graduating Harvard, he struggled to find his path in life and was hit hard by the financial crisis of 1837. With little job prospects, Phillips turned to law and found himself advocating for the oppressed, especially those suffering under the cruelty of slavery. By dedicating himself to the cause of abolitionism, Phillips became one of the most influential speakers and change-makers of his time, eventually playing a major role in the abolition of slavery in the United States. Through his struggles, Phillips found his calling and his passion, and made a lasting impact on history.</p>
