    <p>There was a young man named Alex who grew up in a rough neighborhood. Despite the obstacles he faced, he always knew he wanted to become a doctor. His parents were not supportive of his dreams and often discouraged him, telling him he wasn't smart enough and that he should settle for a less prestigious career.</p>
    <p>But Alex would not be deterred. He worked hard and obtained top grades in high school. He applied to several prestigious universities, but was rejected from all of them. He was devastated and felt like giving up on his dream.</p>
    <p>One day, Alex stumbled upon the story of Lawrence Hargrave, a pioneering aviator and inventor who faced numerous obstacles in his pursuit of flight. Hargrave refused to give up on his vision, and his persistence and innovation ultimately led to significant breakthroughs in aviation technology.</p>
    <p>Thanks to Hargrave's example, Alex found the strength to keep pursuing his dream. He applied to another round of universities and this time, he was accepted to his top choice. He went on to become a successful doctor and credited Hargrave with inspiring him to persevere.</p>
