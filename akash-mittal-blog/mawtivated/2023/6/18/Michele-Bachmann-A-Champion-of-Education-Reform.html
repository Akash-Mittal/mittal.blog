     <h2>Examples of Michele Bachmann's Work</h2>
     <p>During her six years in the Minnesota state Senate, Michele Bachmann was a champion of education reform. She worked to pass legislation that increased teacher accountability and improved the quality of education in Minnesota. She also advocated for increasing the number of charter schools in the state, giving parents more choices for their children's education.</p>
     <p>As a member of the United States House of Representatives, Bachmann continued her work on education reform. She introduced the Academic Partnerships Lead Us to Success (A-PLUS) Act, which would have given states more control over education policy and reduced the federal government's role in education. She also supported efforts to expand school choice and improve teacher quality through measures such as merit pay and alternative certification.</p>
     <p>One of the most notable examples of Bachmann's work on education reform was her opposition to the Common Core State Standards. Bachmann believed that the standards were an overreach by the federal government and would limit the ability of parents and teachers to control their children's education. She worked to raise awareness about the issue and to push back against the implementation of the standards in schools across the country.</p>
