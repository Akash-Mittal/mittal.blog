   <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
   <p>It was a sunny day in June when Andrea first met David. They were both browsing at a bookstore, and their hands inadvertently touched when they reached for the same book. They looked at each other, smiled, and blushed. Andrea felt a swift sensation in her chest, as if someone had set a thousand butterflies loose inside her. David felt a jolt of electricity through his veins, as if someone had switched on a dormant part of his brain. They both knew in that moment that they had fallen in love.</p>
   <blockquote>
    Romantic love is mental illness. But it's a pleasurable one. It's a drug. It distorts reality, and that's the point of it. It would be impossible to fall in love with someone that you really saw. - Fran Lebowitz
   </blockquote>
   <p>Andrea and David's love story unfolded like a dream. They spent hours talking about their interests, exploring the city together, and cuddling in bed. They felt like they had found their missing piece, their soulmate, their destiny. They ignored the warning signs, the red flags, the doubts. They thought they had found the one.</p>
   <h2>Author - Fran Lebowitz</h2>
   <p>Fran Lebowitz is an American author, public speaker, and cultural icon. She was born in 1950 in New Jersey, grew up in a Jewish family, dropped out of high school, and moved to New York City in the 1970s. She soon became a prominent figure in the literary and social scenes, known for her sharp wit, ironic observations, and controversial opinions. She published two collections of essays, <i>Metropolitan Life</i> (1978) and <i>Social Studies</i> (1981), that became bestsellers and established her as a voice of her generation. She also appeared in several films and TV shows, such as <i>The Wolf of Wall Street</i> (2013) and <i>Pretend It's a City</i> (2021), that showcased her unique style and personality.</p>
   <h2>The Pleasure and Distortion of Romantic Love</h2>
   <p>What Fran Lebowitz meant by calling romantic love a mental illness is that it can make us behave in irrational, illogical, and even dangerous ways. It can make us idealize our partner, suppress our own needs, and compromise our values. It can make us overlook flaws, forgive mistakes, and cling to illusions. It can make us lose touch with reality, our friends, and ourselves. It can also make us feel euphoric, passionate, and alive. It can give us a sense of purpose, meaning, and belonging. It can fulfill our deepest desires, dreams, and hopes. It can make us happy.</p>
   <p>However, the price we pay for this pleasure is the distortion of reality. We see our partner as the perfect person, the one who completes us, the one who differs from all other people. We ignore their flaws, their quirks, their weaknesses. We create a fantasy version of them that matches our own needs, expectations, and fantasies. We also see ourselves in a distorted way, as the one who is worthy of their love, attention, and admiration. We ignore our flaws, our quirks, our weaknesses. We create a fantasy version of ourselves that matches our own needs, expectations, and fantasies. We also see the world in a distorted way, as the one that revolves around our love story, as the one that is either for us or against us, as the one that makes sense only in the light of our passion.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>We think that our partner is always right and that we should please them at all costs.</li>
    <li>We think that our partner should meet all our needs and that we should not have to compromise.</li>
    <li>We think that our partner should be the center of our universe and that nothing else matters.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Unfortunately, this distortion of reality can lead to problems such as:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Dependency: We become so attached to our partner that we cannot function without them. We lose our autonomy, our identity, and our self-esteem.</li>
    <li>Jealousy: We become so possessive of our partner that we cannot tolerate their interactions with others. We feel threatened, insecure, and resentful.</li>
    <li>Control: We become so dominant or submissive in our relationship that we cannot respect our partner's autonomy, identity, or self-esteem. We create a power imbalance that can lead to abuse.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Examples</h2>
   <p>Here are some examples of how romantic love can distort reality:</p>
   <blockquote>
    "He called me ten times in one hour and left me love messages on my voicemail. I felt flattered at first, but then I realized that he was stalking me and trying to control my every move."
   </blockquote>
   <p>This example shows how the distorted perception of love can turn into obsession and harassment. The person who received the calls felt flattered because she thought that the guy was expressing his love for her and showing his interest. However, when the guy kept calling and leaving messages, she realized that his behavior was not normal or healthy. She felt trapped, anxious, and unsafe.</p>
   <blockquote>
    "She said that she loved me so much that she wanted to die with me. I felt touched at first, but then I realized that she was emotionally blackmailing me and using me to escape her problems."
   </blockquote>
   <p>This example shows how the distorted expression of love can turn into manipulation and abuse. The person who received the statement felt touched because she thought that the girl was expressing her devotion and loyalty towards her. However, when the girl revealed that she wanted to die with her, she realized that her statement was not romantic or poetic, but rather disturbing and alarming. She felt confused, guilty, and trapped.</p>
   <blockquote>
    "He said that he could not live without me and that he would kill himself if I left him. I felt scared at first, but then I realized that he was trying to control me and manipulate me emotionally."
   </blockquote>
   <p>This example shows how the distorted perception of love can turn into threats and coercion. The person who received the statement felt scared because she thought that the guy was serious about his intention to end his life if she left him. However, when the guy used his suicidal ideation to pressure her to stay with him, she realized that his statement was not genuine or compassionate, but rather manipulative and abusive. She felt trapped, helpless, and responsible.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, romantic love is both a pleasure and a distortion of reality. It can make us feel euphoric, passionate, and alive, but it can also make us behave in irrational, illogical, and even dangerous ways. The key to a healthy and fulfilling love relationship is to balance our emotions with our reason, our passion with our realism, and our fantasy with our reality. Here are three practical tips to achieve this balance:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Communicate clearly and honestly with your partner about your needs, expectations, and boundaries. Listen to their perspective and empathize with their feelings. Avoid assumptions, judgments, and mind-reading.</li>
    <li>Develop your self-awareness and self-esteem by exploring your interests, skills, and values. Take care of your physical, mental, and emotional health by exercising, sleeping, eating, and relaxing. Avoid comparing yourself to others, seeking approval, or seeking perfection.</li>
    <li>Create a supportive and diverse network of friends, family, and peers who share your values, interests, and goals. Seek their advice, comfort, and feedback when needed. Avoid isolating yourself, neglecting your relationships, or relying too much on your partner.</li>
   </ul>
