   <h2>An Inspiring Story of Amy Heckerling</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>Once upon a time, there was a young woman named Amy Heckerling who aspired to be a filmmaker. She studied at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts and worked hard to make her dreams a reality. However, as she got older, she began to notice a disturbing trend in Hollywood - the lack of roles for women over 40, especially those who weren't conventionally beautiful.</p>
   <p>Heckerling was determined not to let this stop her. She continued to make films that challenged the status quo and spoke to women of all ages. Her most famous work, the 1982 movie Fast Times at Ridgemont High, is an iconic coming-of-age story that still resonates with audiences today.</p>
   <p>Despite her success, Heckerling acknowledges that Hollywood can be a tough industry for older women. In her words, "Hollywood is the dream factory, and no one dreams about older women." But does it have to be this way?</p>
   <h3>The Reality for Older Women in Hollywood</h3>
   <p>It's no secret that Hollywood is ageist and sexist. As women age, their opportunities for on-screen roles shrink dramatically. The numbers speak for themselves - according to a study by San Diego State University's Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film, women over 40 represented just 20% of all female characters in popular movies in 2017.</p>
   <p>But it's not just about the number of roles available - it's about the quality of those roles. Older women are often relegated to playing stereotypical "mom" or "granny" characters, with little depth or complexity. And even when they do get meaty roles, they are often subject to harsh criticism and scrutiny from audiences and the media.</p>
   <h3>Why We Need More Stories About Older Women</h3>
   <p>Despite all this, there is hope for change. More and more filmmakers are pushing back against Hollywood's narrow view of women and telling stories that showcase the diverse and complex experiences of all women, including those over 40.</p>
   <p>It's important to remember that the stories we tell shape our culture and how we see ourselves. When we only see women as objects of desire or caretakers, we are limiting our collective imagination and denying the full humanity of half the population.</p>
   <h3>Examples of Films Featuring Older Women</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Book Club (2018) - A group of older women (played by Jane Fonda, Diane Keaton, Candice Bergen, and Mary Steenburgen) discover the joys of reading Fifty Shades of Grey and rediscover their own passions and desires.</li>
    <li>Gloria Bell (2018) - Julianne Moore stars in this remake of the Chilean film Gloria, about a middle-aged divorcee who starts a new relationship while navigating the challenges of being single in her 50s.</li>
    <li>The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2011) - A group of British retirees (including Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, and Bill Nighy) travel to India to start a new chapter in their lives, finding unexpected love and adventure along the way.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>These films show that there is a hunger for stories about older women, and that audiences are eager to see these stories told with honesty, humor, and heart.</p>
   <h3>Conclusion</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>We need more stories about older women in Hollywood, both in front of and behind the camera.</li>
    <li>Older women deserve to have complex and nuanced roles that reflect their diverse experiences and perspectives.</li>
    <li>The stories we tell have the power to shape how we see ourselves and each other, and it's time for Hollywood to take responsibility for the messages it sends to the world.</li>
