  <h1>Poetry: The Language of Emotions</h1></br> <img src="images/Poetry-The-Language-of-Emotions.jpeg" alt="+Poetry-The-Language-of-Emotions+"></br>
  <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2> As a child, Emily loved to write poetry. However, as she grew older, she was told that poetry was not a practical or useful skill. So she put away her pen and pursued a more conventional career. But one day, when she was going through a difficult time, she stumbled upon a collection of poems that she had written as a teenager. As she read through them, she was transported back to a simpler time, and she felt a deep sense of comfort and connection. Inspired by this experience, she began to write poetry again, and found that it was a powerful tool for processing her emotions and finding meaning in her life. 
  <h2>What is Poetry?</h2> According to Erica Jong, the author of <em>Fear of Flying</em>, poetry is what we turn to in the most emotional moments of our life - when a beloved friend dies, when a baby is born, or when we fall in love. Poetry is not just a form of artistic expression, but also a means of communication and connection. It allows us to share our deepest feelings and thoughts in a way that is both personal and universal. At its core, poetry is a language of emotions. It uses words and imagery to express feelings, ideas, and experiences that are often too complex or subtle to be captured by other forms of communication. Poetry can be joyful or sad, beautiful or haunting, but it always speaks directly to the heart. 
  <h2>Why Poetry Matters</h2> Poetry has been around for thousands of years, and it continues to be a vital part of human culture. Here are some of the reasons why poetry matters:
