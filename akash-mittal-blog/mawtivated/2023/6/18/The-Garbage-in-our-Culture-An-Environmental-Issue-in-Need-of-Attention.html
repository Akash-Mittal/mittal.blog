   <h3>An Inspiring Story</h3>
   <p>Eight-year-old Chloe noticed the trash that littered the park where she played. Motivated to do something about it, she enlisted the help of her friends and family to clean up the park - one piece of trash at a time. Their efforts made a huge difference, and the park became a beautiful, clean space for children and families to enjoy. Chloe's actions show that even a small act can make a big impact on the environment.</p>

   <h3>The Problem</h3>
   <p>Just as there's garbage that pollutes the Potomac river, there is garbage polluting our culture. We are bombarded with negative messages in the media, and offensive language and behavior are becoming more and more common. This garbage is harmful to the environment we live in, and it's time to take action.</p>
   <h4>Examples of the Garbage in our Culture</h4>
   <ul>
    <li>Reality TV shows that promote shallow values and scandalous behavior</li>

    <li>Advertising that uses sexualization and objectification to sell products</li>
   </ul>
   <p>We need an Environmental Protection Agency to clean up this cultural pollution and create a healthier, more positive environment.</p>
