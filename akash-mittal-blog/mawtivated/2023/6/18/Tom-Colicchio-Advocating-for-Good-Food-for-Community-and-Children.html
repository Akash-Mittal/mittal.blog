  <p>As a successful celebrity chef, Tom Colicchio has transformed the culinary industry in the US through his leadership and advocacy, and has commanded many dedicated followers with his passionate commitment to transforming the food system. He has always been vocal about his values, which are anchored around the need to ensure that every child has access to nutritious meals both at home and at school.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>According to Tom Colicchio, the government should not have a role in mandating what we feed our kids at home. But when it comes to the food served at school, taxpayers' money is being spent and, therefore, better food options should be available. He believes that it is the responsibility of adults to lead by example and encourage healthier eating habits to future generations.</p>

  <p>Tom Colicchio has been a vocal critic of the quality of food served in schools for decades, and now he has taken his campaign for better food to Capitol Hill. His campaign, the Food Policy Action (FPA), brings together chefs, food producers, and other leaders in the food industry to advocate for better food policies. In fact, Colicchio's advocacy on food policy issues began over a decade ago, when he made a call to action to address the issue of hunger and poverty in America by teaming up with the organization "Share our Strength" to establish their "No Kid Hungry" campaign. Since then, the campaign has raised over $500 million to aid child hunger in the country.</p>

  <p>In a recent interview, Tom Colicchio stressed the need to invest in healthy school meals, rather than investing in advertisements for junk food. He shared that his son once came home from school with a homework assignment requesting the family to create a menu for McDonald's. Tom did not find that amusing and instead called the school to share his concerns over promoting fast food to children. The school eventually agreed and stopped using fast food brands for homework assignments.</p>

  <p>Tom Colicchio is an example of a chef who not only creates excellent and nutritious food, but also advocates for food policies that will ensure that everyone has access to these vital provisions. His philosophy is that every chef has a responsibility to use their voice to fight for better food policies that will benefit the wider community. Besides his advocacy for better school meals and for helping to fight child hunger, Tom Colicchio is also vocal about the importance of preserving small farmers and fostering a healthier food system with more sustainable and nutritious food options.</p>

  <p>Practical Tips:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. When packing school lunches, it is essential to think beyond the standard sandwich and chips combo. Get creative with healthy alternatives that your child will enjoy. Shaped sandwiches, fresh fruit, and homemade trail mix are just a few simple ideas.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. When grocery shopping, opt for whole foods and avoid processed snacks. Packing healthier snacks like oranges, apples, and celery sticks can help to keep your child energized throughout the day.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Encourage your child to participate in meal preparation and planning. This not only helps you to bond with your child, but it also instills in them the importance of healthy eating habits.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, we need to take the responsibility to ensure that our children are consuming healthy and nourishing food. Tom Colicchio advocates that we should be teaching our little ones about healthy eating habits at school by providing them with nutritious foods instead of junk food. Parents also need to play an active role by serving healthier meals at home to ensure that their children are getting adequate nutrition.</p>
