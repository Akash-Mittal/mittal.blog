  <h1>The Warming Ramadan</h1></br> <img src="images/Is-It-Really-Ramadan.jpeg" alt="+Is-It-Really-Ramadan+"></br>
  <p>It's the beginning of Ramadan, yet the environment seems to be too warm. The searing heat and Thanksgiving arriving early has caused a disturbance in the usual seasonal cycle. This change has left many Muslims pondering if it truly feels like Ramadan. Let me share a motivational anecdote on this issue.</p>
  <p>It's a story of Ali who was a casual young man with no visions. He was always pushing off things he needed to do and never felt fulfilled in his life. But after a while, he began to understand how time slips through the hands and knew deep down he was meant for greater things. He resolved to set his priorities straight and began fasting regularly, praying five times a day, and reading the holy Quran. Slowly but surely, he was able to reap the benefits of these healthy spiritual changes, and his life took a complete turn.</p>
  <p>There are points in our existence where we confuse what and who we are with the surroundings around us. The high temperature is external, but connecting with Allah Ta'ala should have no limit. Maybe it's time to break the pattern and remember that the real transformative gen is within.</p>
  <h2>David Letterman's Journey</h2>
  <p>David Letterman, a groundbreaking late-night television host who has interviewed people from all walks of life, has often talked about his spiritual background. He has revealed that he began to pray and started observing Ramadan once he sensed he had reached a spiritual dry spell. Letterman also told his audience once; it's like the universe woke him up, and he connected with his inner self.</p>
  <p>Your environment does not have to be a limiting factor in your spiritual journey. What need to break through is to have the determination to stay true to yourself even in the most challenging situations.</p>
  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>Think back to the most fulfilling Ramadan that you've ever experienced. What made it so special?</li>
   <li>Consider doing a community iftar with your friends or family. Sharing the spirit of Ramadan can make the practice feel more robust and connect you with those around you.</li>
   <li>Take a refreshing walk outside in the evening. Entering a quiet outdoor space can allow us to reconnect with nature and the Almighty.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>While external factors can be overwhelming, Ramadan is an excellent opportunity to seek healing and align your focus on your faith.</li>
   <li>Let us not aspire to search for excuses in this difficult time, instead let's embrace the teachings of Ramadan, both inwardly and outwardly.</li>
   <li>We must indulge in the occasion's habit of charity, even if the breaking of the fast is challenging, as it is an act of giving that is not only prayer but also praise for Allah Almighty.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>In Conclusion, the early Thanksgiving may have a variation in your Ramadan routine, but the energy and essence of the event is still running. We must not allow external circumstances to shape or define our understanding of faith. Rather, we should look within and reconnect with the Almighty. And remember, it's never too late to change and transform for the better.</p>
