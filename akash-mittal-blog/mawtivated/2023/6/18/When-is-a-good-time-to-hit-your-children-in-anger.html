   <h2>Is Hitting Your Children Ever Justifiable?</h2>
   <p>As parents, we have to make some of the toughest decisions, and disciplining our children is one such situation. Hitting them in anger should never be one of the options. Yet, it is something that many of us (parents) find ourselves doing.</p>
   <p>Many experts recommend that parents instill discipline through non-violent means such as verbal warnings, time-outs, and revoking privileges. However, what happens when you have tried every possible method and it still doesn't get the desired result?</p>
   <p>For some parents, hitting their children might seem like the only possible solution. But when is a good time? Perhaps when you're feeling festive? Of course not.</p>
   <p>So, when is it ever justifiable? Never!</p><br>
   <h3>Violence Begets Violence</h3>
   <p>As parents, we are expected to lead by example. If you choose violence to resolve an issue, then your children may adopt the same behavior. Therefore, it is essential that you work towards finding a solution to make your child understand their mistake and correct their behavior non-violently.</p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1544244011-10aef8da9b90" alt="parents and children">
