  <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 22px; margin: 30px;">It was a hot summer day in a remote village of Africa. A group of tourists was exploring the village and happened to meet an old man sitting under the shade of a tree. They asked him - "What is the secret of your eternal happiness?" The old man smiled and replied - "I shifted my focus from what I cannot control to what I can control and that made all the difference."</p>
  <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 30px; margin-top: 50px;">The Story of Yitzhak Rabin</h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 22px; margin: 30px;">Yitzhak Rabin was an Israeli politician and military general who served as the Prime Minister of Israel twice. He was born in Jerusalem on March 1, 1922. Rabin was instrumental in the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993 which aimed to achieve peace between Israel and Palestine. It was a historic moment and Rabin was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. However, his efforts were short-lived as he was assassinated by a right-wing extremist in 1995. His death was a huge setback for the peace process, but his legacy lives on.</p>
  <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 30px; margin-top: 50px;">Diplomatic Peace vs. Real Peace</h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 22px; margin: 30px;">A diplomatic peace is a peace that is achieved through negotiations and agreements. It is a necessary step in the peace process but it is not the real peace. The real peace is a state of harmony where there is mutual respect, trust, and understanding between all parties. A diplomatic peace is like a Band-Aid that covers the wound but does not heal it. It is a temporary solution that needs to be followed by sustained efforts to achieve real peace.</p>
