  <h1>From Dependency on Government to Dependence on God: A Call for Personal Responsibility</h1></br> <img src="images/From-Dependency-on-Government-to-Dependence-on-God-A-Call-for-Personal-Responsibility.jpeg" alt="+From-Dependency-on-Government-to-Dependence-on-God-A-Call-for-Personal-Responsibility+"></br>
  <p>It was a dark and stormy night when Tom found himself stranded on a deserted road in the middle of nowhere. His car had broken down and he had no cell phone reception to call for help. Feeling helpless and alone, he started to panic. Just then, a stranger in a beat-up truck pulled over and offered to help him. Tom hesitated at first, but something about the man's kind face and gentle demeanor put him at ease.</p>
  <p>The stranger, whose name turned out to be Jim, took a look under the hood and quickly diagnosed the problem. He didn't have all the tools he needed to fix it on the spot, but he promised to come back in the morning with everything he needed and get Tom back on the road.</p>
  <p>Tom was grateful beyond words. As he watched Jim drive away, he couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at the kindness of strangers. He realized that despite all the problems and challenges he faced in life, there was still hope for humanity. After all, at the end of the day, people were all just people.</p>
  <p>For many Americans, the idea of personal responsibility is one that has been lost in the chaos of modern life. We live in a culture of entitlement, where people expect to be taken care of by the government or by others. But as Sharron Angle reminds us, this is not what our country was founded on.</p>
  <h2>The First Commandment</h2>
  <p>In many ways, the First Commandment is the basis for all other Commandments. It reminds us that we are all accountable to a higher power, and that we must follow His will rather than our own. This means that we must take responsibility for our own lives, rather than relying on others to do it for us.</p>
  <p>But in today's world, it's easy to forget about God and to place our faith in other things. We might turn to drugs or alcohol as a way to cope with our problems, or we might become obsessed with social media or other distractions. All of these things are idols that take us away from our true purpose in life, which is to serve God and to do His will.</p>
  <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
  <p>Sharron Angle is a political activist and former state legislator from Nevada. She is known for her conservative views and her commitment to personal responsibility. In her own life, she has faced many challenges, including health problems and financial difficulties. But instead of becoming bitter or angry, she has used these experiences to fuel her activism and to inspire others.</p>
  <p>One example of this is her work on the issue of homelessness. She has always believed that people should be responsible for their own lives, and that the government should not be in the business of providing handouts. But instead of simply criticizing the existing system, she has taken action to help those in need.</p>
  <p>One way she has done this is by volunteering at a local homeless shelter. She spends her time cooking meals, cleaning up, and even organizing job training programs for the residents. Through her efforts, she has been able to help many people get back on their feet and become self-sufficient.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Idolatry</h2>
  <p>One of the most obvious examples of idolatry in our society is our dependence on government programs. Whether it's welfare, food stamps, or unemployment benefits, many people have come to rely on these programs as a way of life. They see them as entitlements, rather than as temporary solutions to temporary problems.</p>
  <p>But relying on the government for everything is not only unsustainable, it's also immoral. We have a duty to take care of ourselves and our families, and to help those in need. But we cannot do this if we are constantly looking to the government to solve our problems.</p>
  <p>Another example of idolatry is our obsession with material possessions. We have become a society that values things over people, and we are always looking for the next big thing to buy or to own. But material possessions can never truly satisfy us, and they can never give us the sense of purpose and fulfillment that we crave.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, we must remember that we are all accountable to a higher power, and that we must take responsibility for our own lives. We cannot place our faith in idols such as government programs or material possessions, but must instead turn to God for guidance and strength.</p>
  <p>To achieve this, we must make a conscious effort to live our lives with purpose and intention. We must seek out ways to help others, to make a difference in the world, and to serve God in all that we do.</p>
  <p>In order to do this, we need to take practical steps such as volunteering our time, reducing our dependence on material possessions, and supporting policies that promote personal responsibility and self-sufficiency.</p>
