    <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
    <p>As a young girl growing up in rural Idaho, my grandmother often had to forgo necessary medical treatment due to the cost. This inspired me to become an advocate for seniors and their access to affordable health care.</p>
    <p>Recently, I had the pleasure of meeting a 78-year-old woman named Mary. She had been diagnosed with a chronic condition that required her to take several prescription medications each day. Despite having worked hard and saved diligently throughout her life, Mary was struggling to afford her necessary medications due to their high cost.</p>
    <p>Listening to Mary's story and seeing the fear and uncertainty in her eyes made me realize just how critical this issue is for seniors across Idaho.</p>

    <h2>The Rising Cost of Health Care and Prescription Drugs</h2>
    <p>As I travel around Idaho and visit with seniors, I hear almost universal concern about the rising cost of health care, particularly the cost of prescription drugs. For many seniors living on a fixed income, the high cost of medications can mean having to choose between paying for basic necessities like food and rent or paying for their medications.</p>
    <p>According to a recent report from AARP, the average annual cost of prescription drug treatment increased 57.8% between 2012 and 2017, compared to an overall inflation rate of 9.6%. This trend shows no signs of slowing down, with many seniors struggling to afford their medications or going without necessary treatment altogether.</p>
    <p>It's imperative that policymakers at both the state and national levels take action to address the rising cost of health care and prescription drugs for our seniors.</p>

    <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
    <p>Mary's story is not unique. Across Idaho, I've met countless seniors who are struggling to afford their medications and health care. Take, for example, Tom and Linda, a couple in their late 60s. Tom had recently been diagnosed with a chronic condition and was prescribed a medication that cost over $400 per month. Despite having Medicare coverage, their out-of-pocket costs were still too high for them to afford.</p>
    <p>Or consider Ruth, an 86-year-old widow living on a fixed income. Ruth suffers from arthritis and takes a medication that costs over $200 per month. She and her late husband had saved diligently throughout their lives, but their retirement funds are quickly dwindling due to the high cost of her medications.</p>
    <p>These are just a few examples of the many seniors across our state who are struggling to afford their necessary medications. Without action from policymakers and the pharmaceutical industry, this problem will only continue to grow.</p>

    <h2>What Can Be Done?</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>Allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies.</li>
     <li>Create transparency in drug pricing to ensure patients are able to make informed decisions about their care.</li>
     <li>Encourage the use of generic medications where appropriate.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By taking these steps, we can work towards ensuring that our seniors are able to access the affordable health care and prescription drugs they need to stay healthy and vibrant members of our communities.</p>
