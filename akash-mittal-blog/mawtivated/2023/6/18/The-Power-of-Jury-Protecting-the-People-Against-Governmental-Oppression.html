    <h2>An Inspiring Story of Justice Prevailing Over Oppression</h2>
    <p>It was a cold winter day in 1955 when a 15-year-old African American girl named Claudette Colvin refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery, Alabama bus to a white person. Her actions sparked a grassroots movement that eventually led to the Montgomery Bus Boycott. As the boycott continued, nine months later, the Supreme Court ruled that racial segregation on public transportation was unconstitutional.</p>
    <p>What made Colvin's act of defiance so powerful was not just her conviction and bravery, but the fact that a jury, composed of her peers, had the power to judge the justice of the oppressive laws that had been placed upon her. The jury had the ability to protect her and others against governmental oppression. This power of the jury has been exercised throughout history and has the ability to protect the people against unjust laws.</p>

    <h2>About the Author - Lysander Spooner</h2>
    <p>Lysander Spooner was an American political philosopher and abolitionist born in 1808. He is best known for his book "No Treason: The Constitution of No Authority" in which he argued that the Constitution did not give the government any powers that it did not already have and that the people had the right to secede and form their own government if the government became too oppressive.</p>
    <p>Spooner's work focused heavily on the idea of individual sovereignty and the need for people to have the ability to protect themselves against government oppression. The power of the jury played a significant role in his philosophy as he believed that it was one of the most important tools that people had to protect themselves against oppressive laws.</p>

    <h2>Examples of the Power of the Jury</h2>
    <p>One of the most famous examples of the power of the jury comes from the trial of John Peter Zenger in 1735. Zenger was a printer who had published articles critical of the colonial governor of New York. He was charged with seditious libel, which was illegal under English common law. However, the jury refused to convict Zenger, finding that he had not committed a crime. This case was a landmark in the history of American free speech and helped establish the principle that the truth is a defense against libel charges.</p>
    <p>Another example of the power of the jury comes from the trial of William Penn in 1670. Penn, a Quaker, was charged with unlawful assembly and disturbing the peace because he had attended a religious meeting with other Quakers. However, the jury refused to convict him, and the judge eventually released him after several hung juries. This case helped establish the principle that people had the right to freedom of religion.</p>
