    <p>It was the early 1990s and Dave Grohl was on top of the world. He had just joined the band Nirvana as their drummer and they were about to release their second album, "Nevermind". The album would go on to become a cultural phenomenon and make Nirvana one of the biggest bands in the world.</p>
    <p>With fame came the opportunities to indulge in drugs and alcohol, something that many of his fellow musicians were doing. But Grohl had a different mindset. He loved to play music and knew that drugs would only hinder his ability to do that.</p>
    <blockquote>
     "I love to play music. So why endanger that with something like drugs?" - Dave Grohl
    </blockquote>
    <p>Instead, he chose sobriety and focused on his craft. He went on to become not only one of the most successful drummers in rock history, but also a talented singer and songwriter. He formed his own band, the Foo Fighters, in 1994 and they have released several acclaimed albums.</p>
