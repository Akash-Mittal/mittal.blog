     <h2>Inspiring Story</h2>
     <p>Once upon a time, there was a wise man named Henry Ward Beecher. He was a renowned clergyman, social reformer, and speaker who lived in the 19th century. He believed that the art of being happy lies in the power of extracting happiness from common things. It's not about accumulating wealth, possessions, or fame, but about finding joy in the simple pleasures of life.</p>
     <p>One day, a young woman came to him and asked for his advice on how to be happy. She told him that she was always unhappy and felt like something was missing in her life. Henry Ward Beecher smiled and said, "My dear, happiness is not something that you can find outside of yourself. It's already within you. You just have to discover it."</p>
     <p>He then took out a small rock from his pocket and said, "See this stone? It's just an ordinary stone that you may find on the street. But to me, it's a treasure. Whenever I feel unhappy or stressed, I hold this stone in my hand and feel its texture, weight, and shape. I imagine all the wonders and mysteries of nature that led to its creation, and I feel grateful and blessed to be alive."</p>
     <p>The young woman was surprised and asked, "But how can a stone make you happy?" Henry Ward Beecher replied, "It's not the stone that makes me happy. It's my attitude and perspective that make me happy. I choose to see the beauty and goodness in the world instead of the ugliness and evil. That's the secret of happiness."</p>

     <h2>Background of Henry Ward Beecher</h2>
     <p>Henry Ward Beecher was born in 1813 in Litchfield, Connecticut, to a prominent religious family. His father was a famous preacher and his sister was the author of the famous novel <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em>. He followed in his father's footsteps and became a minister in his early twenties. He was known for his persuasive and entertaining speeches that attracted large crowds of people. He was also a passionate advocate for abolition, women's suffrage, and temperance.</p>
     <p>Despite his successes, he suffered from personal tragedies and scandals that tarnished his reputation. His daughter died from scarlet fever, his son was involved in a sex scandal, and he himself was accused of adultery. However, he never lost his faith, humor, or optimism. He continued to preach and write until his death in 1887.</p>
