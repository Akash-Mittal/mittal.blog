    <p>Sarah had always struggled with anxiety and depression. She felt like she was constantly battling negative thoughts and feelings. One day, she met someone who would change her life forever.</p>
    <p>It all started with a simple gesture - a hug. This person hugged her tightly and for the first time in a long time, Sarah felt a sense of comfort and safety.

    <h2>The Science Behind Affection</h2>
    <p>Research has shown that affection can have a powerful effect on our mental and emotional well-being. When we receive affection, our bodies release hormones such as oxytocin - also known as the "love hormone" - which can lead to feelings of happiness and relaxation.</p>
    <p>It's not just receiving affection that can boost our mood - giving affection can be just as beneficial. When we express our love and care for others, we feel a sense of purpose and connection that can bring us happiness and fulfillment.</p>
