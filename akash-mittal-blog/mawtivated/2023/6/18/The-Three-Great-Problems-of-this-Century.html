  <h1>The Three Great Problems of this Century</h1></br> <img src="images/The-Three-Great-Problems-of-this-Century.jpeg" alt="+The-Three-Great-Problems-of-this-Century+"></br>
  <p>Once upon a time, there was a man named Victor Hugo who said, "The three great problems of this century the degradation of man in the proletariat, the subjection of women through hunger, the atrophy of the child by darkness." These words still resonate in today's society as we continue to face these problems.</p>
  <p>One of the greatest challenges we face is the degradation of man in the proletariat. With the ever-growing economic inequality that plagues our world, many people are forced to live in poverty. They may not have access to basic necessities like food, water, shelter, and healthcare. This can lead to feelings of hopelessness and despair, which can have a profound impact on mental and physical health.</p>
  <p>The subjection of women through hunger is another problem we face. Globally, women are often victims of gender discrimination and lack of access to education and economic opportunities. Many women and girls face hunger due to poverty, which further exacerbates these problems. When women are unable to access basic resources, they are unable to lead healthy and productive lives.</p>
  <p>Finally, the atrophy of the child by darkness is a third great problem of this century. Children are often exposed to dangerous and unhealthy living conditions, which can lead to physical and mental health problems. They may not have access to quality education or the opportunity to play and interact with other children. This can ultimately impact their ability to succeed later in life.</p>
  <h2>Examples of these Problems</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>The economic crisis in Venezuela has led to widespread hunger and poverty.</li>
   <li>In many parts of the world, girls are not given the opportunity to attend school, which limits their potential.</li>
   <li>In some areas, children are forced to work in dangerous and exploitative conditions.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, we must acknowledge and address these three great problems of our century. We must work to reduce poverty and income inequality, promote gender equality and women's empowerment, and ensure that children have access to a safe and nurturing environment. To achieve this, we must work together as a global community to create policies and initiatives that promote social and economic justice.</p>
