   <p>Once upon a time, there was a wise old man who lived in a small village. He was known for his wisdom and people from far and wide would come to ask for his advice. But despite his knowledge, he was a lonely old man and had no one to share his life with. One day, he met a young woman who was full of love and affection. They fell in love and started a life together. And the wise old man realized that kisses were a better fate than wisdom.</p>
   <p>Love and affection are what make life worth living. Without them, we are empty and alone. We can accumulate all the knowledge in the world, but without love, it is meaningless. This is what e. e. cummings meant when he said, "Kisses are a better fate than wisdom."</p>
   <h2>The Story of e. e. cummings</h2>
   <p>e. e. cummings was an American poet, writer, and artist who lived in the early 20th century. He was known for his unconventional style of writing, which often involved playing with syntax and punctuation. He was also known for his love of life and his belief in the power of love and affection.</p>
   <p>One of his most famous poems is "i carry your heart with me," which talks about how love is what gives life meaning. Cummings believed that love was the greatest force in the universe and that it could conquer all obstacles.</p>

   </ul>
   <p>Love is what connects us to the world around us and gives us a sense of purpose. It can give us the courage to face challenges and the strength to overcome them.</p>
