   <h2>God vs Director</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>It was the year 1986 when I first met Mr. James Stone. He was a renowned documentary filmmaker who had many successful films to his credit. I was lucky enough to get the opportunity to assist him in his next project. While I was excited, I was also nervous as I did not have much experience in documentary filmmaking. But Mr. Stone had a unique way of teaching me the craft of documentary filmmaking. He said, "In feature films the director is God, but in documentary films, God is the director."</p>
   <h3>What Does It Mean?</h3>
   <p>The statement by Mr. Stone was not a mere play of words but had a deep meaning. It is a reflection of the creative process of documentary filmmaking where the director is not only responsible for the script, visuals, and editing but also for capturing the essence of truth in the film. Documentary filmmaking demands honesty, integrity, and passion, where the director must be willing to get into the skin of the subject and portray it in the most realistic manner.</p>
   <p>In contrast, a feature film director has the freedom to create his own world and tell a story in a fictional manner. This does not mean that the director of a feature film lacks creativity; instead, it is a different kind of creativity, where the director has the freedom to shape the world according to his vision.</p>
   <h3>Alfred Hitchcock's Take on Documentary Filmmaking</h3>
   <blockquote>
    "In feature films, the director is always king; in documentary filmmaking, king is always the reality."
   </blockquote>
   <p>Alfred Hitchcock, who was a master of suspenseful feature films, had also dabbled in documentary filmmaking. According to him, while feature films are fictional, documentaries are factual. It requires the director to shape the reality in a creative manner but without compromising the truth. Hitchcock believed that documentary filmmaking was a noble art, where one can make an impact and change the world.</p>
   <h3>Examples of Great Documentary Films</h3>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Grizzly Man</strong>: Directed by Werner Herzog, this documentary tells the story of Timothy Treadwell, who lived with grizzly bears in Alaska and was eventually killed by them.</li>
    <li><strong>Won't You Be My Neighbor</strong>: Directed by Morgan Neville, this documentary is about the life of Fred Rogers, the host of the popular children's show, Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood.</li>
    <li><strong>Planet Earth</strong>: This documentary is a nature series that took five years to make and covers a variety of habitats and different species of animals across the planet.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Tips for Documentary Filmmakers</h3>
   <p>If you are a budding documentary filmmaker, here are some tips that can help you in your journey:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Research:</strong> It is essential to thoroughly research your subject before making the film. This will provide you with in-depth knowledge and help you decide the direction of your film.</li>
    <li><strong>Be Objective:</strong> While it is important to be passionate about the subject, one should also maintain a certain level of objectivity. This will ensure that the film does not turn out to be one-sided.</li>
    <li><strong>Be Prepared:</strong> It is crucial to be prepared before shooting the film. This includes arranging for the required equipment, having a script or at least a rough outline of the film, and scheduling interviews with your subjects.</li>
    <li><strong>Be Creative:</strong> Even though reality is the king, it does not mean that you cannot be creative. Experiment with different camera angles, lighting, and sound to create a unique and captivating film.</li>
    <li><strong>Be Ethical:</strong> Finally, always maintain ethical standards and do not compromise on the truth. A documentary film is a representation of reality, and any manipulation can dent the credibility of the film.</li>
