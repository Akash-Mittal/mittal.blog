   <article>
    <p>Once upon a time, there lived a man named Martin Luther. He was a German professor of theology, composer, and a monk who was widely recognized as the protagonist of the Reformation and its religious movement.</p>
    <p>Martin Luther's story inspired many people, especially those who wanted to change the status quo in their society. His beliefs and principles were so strong that they ignited a flame of hope in many hearts, including mine.</p>
    <h2>The Will: A Blessing or a Curse?</h2>
    <blockquote>
     <p>"The will is a beast of burden. If God mounts it, it wishes and goes as God wills if Satan mounts it, it wishes and goes as Satan wills Nor can it choose its rider... the riders contend for its possession."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Martin Luther's quote above highlights the dilemma of the human will. We all have the power to choose, yet sometimes we feel powerless to control our own desires, wants, and needs. The human will is like a beast of burden that can either be a blessing or a curse, depending on who is in control.</p>
    <p>If we allow God to mount our will, it will move in the direction of goodness, kindness, and love. But if we let Satan take over, our will becomes weak, enslaved, and limited.</p>
    <p>So, the question is, how can we take control of our will and make it work for us rather than against us?</p>
    <h2>Practical Tips for Taming the Beast</h2>
    <ul>
     <li><strong>Be intentional:</strong> One of the best ways to control your will is to be intentional about what you want to achieve. Set clear goals, make a plan, and stay focused on your vision.</li>
     <li><strong>Watch your thoughts:</strong> Our thoughts influence our actions, so it's essential to monitor them and replace negative ones with positive ones. Practice gratitude, mindfulness, and positive affirmations regularly.</li>
     <li><strong>Embrace change:</strong> Change is constant, and the ability to adapt to it is essential for success. Be open-minded, flexible, and willing to learn new things. Embrace challenges and use them as opportunities for growth.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Examples of Successful Will-Taming</h2>
    <p>Here are some examples of people who took control of their will and achieved their goals:</p>
    <ul>
     <li><strong>Abraham Lincoln:</strong> He suffered from severe depression, yet he didn't let it stop him from becoming the 16th President of the United States.</li>
     <li><strong>Melissa McCarthy:</strong> She's one of the most successful comedians and actresses today, yet she struggled with confidence and self-doubt in her early career.</li>
     <li><strong>Stephen King:</strong> He was rejected 30 times before his first novel, "Carrie," was accepted for publication. Today, he's one of the most successful writers in history.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Conclusion: Taming the Beast in 3 Points</h2>
    <p>To sum it up, taming the beast of our will is an ongoing process that requires self-awareness, intentionality, and resilience. Remember these three points:</p>
    <ol>
     <li><strong>Choose your rider:</strong> Decide who you want to control your will and stick to it. Don't let anyone or anything else take over.</li>
     <li><strong>Stay focused:</strong> Keep your eyes on the prize and don't get distracted by negative thoughts, doubts, or fears.</li>
     <li><strong>Stay the course:</strong> Keep moving forward, even if you encounter setbacks, failures, or obstacles. Believe in yourself and your ability to achieve your goals.</li>
    </ol>
