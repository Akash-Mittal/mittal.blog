    <h2>The Inspiring Story</h2>
    <p>Eric Cantona, a French former professional footballer, had many good moments during his career, but his best moment is one that has become legendary. In January 1995, during a match against Crystal Palace, Cantona was sent off after receiving a red card. As he was walking towards the tunnel, a fan started shouting insults at him. Cantona couldn't take it anymore and jumped over the advertising boards to kick the hooligan in the chest.</p>
