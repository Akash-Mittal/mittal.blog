    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <p>Do you ever feel like you were meant to do something, but you're not quite sure what that something is?</p>
    <p>Saul Williams, a poet, writer, and musician, felt this way growing up. He enjoyed making up rhymes, but never thought poetry would become his life.</p>
    <p>It wasn't until he discovered slam poetry, a competitive form of spoken word, that he realized the power of poetry.</p>
    <blockquote>
     "Slam poetry changed everything for me. It was a way to take my innermost thoughts and feelings and put them out there for the world to hear. It was cathartic, empowering, and scary all at the same time."
    </blockquote>
    <p>Through slam poetry, Williams found his voice and his purpose. He went on to win multiple championships and release albums, books, and films. He's also acted in movies and on Broadway.</p>
    <p>Williams' story can inspire us all to find our own purpose and use the power of poetry to achieve it.</p>
