  <p><em>"I wake up every morning and thank God for life. They're some people didn't make it last night. But I'm happy to be here."</em></p>
  <p>That's what my grandma used to say every time I asked her how she was doing. She may not have had much in terms of material possessions, but her gratitude was overflowing. One thing I've realized after she passed away is that her daily prayers of gratitude are not enough. We can't just be grateful for life; we also have to live it with purpose and intention. That's why I'm speaking out against the sales tax on food, and joining the calls to eliminate it.</p>
  <h2>A Personal Call to Action</h2>
  <p>My name is Joe Manchin, and I was born and raised in West Virginia. When I was growing up, my family and I struggled to make ends meet. My parents worked hard, but their wages were never enough to cover all the bills. As a result, my siblings and I were sometimes sent to school with an empty stomach. Those experiences have shaped my perspective on life, and have driven me to advocate for those who are still struggling with food insecurity.</p>
  <h2>Sales Tax Reduction: A Step Forward</h2>
  <p>When I was elected to office, one of my priorities was to reduce the sales tax on food. I'm proud to say that we've achieved that goal. Food is now more affordable for our constituents, especially the most vulnerable ones. Families can now save a few more dollars for their other needs, like housing, healthcare, or education.</p>
  <h2>Eliminating Sales Tax on Food: A Step Further</h2>
  <p>However, we cannot stop here. Sales tax reduction is not enough. It's not fair to tax someone's basic needs. Food is not a luxury item; it's a necessity for survival. No one deserves to go hungry or skip meals just because they can't afford the sales tax. Moreover, taxing food disproportionately affects the low-income families, the elderly, the disabled, and the minorities. It creates a regressive tax system that exacerbates the inequalities and insecurities in our society. For these reasons, we need to eliminate sales tax on food altogether.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Successful Elimination</h2>
  <p>Some states have already realized this and taken action. Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon don't have any sales tax on food. In these states, people can buy groceries without having to pay any extra tax. They also provide the residents with some of the lowest food costs in the country, according to a 2020 report by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Other states have reduced the sales tax on food, but are still working towards its complete elimination. Kansas, for instance, has gradually lowered its sales tax on food from 6.5% in 2019 to 5.5% in 2021, and plans to reduce it further to 0% by 2023.</p>
