  <h1>What Are You Doing for Others?</h1></br> <img src="images/What-Are-You-Doing-for-Others-Martin-Luther-King-Jr.jpeg" alt="+What-Are-You-Doing-for-Others-Martin-Luther-King-Jr+"></br>
  <p>Life's most persistent and urgent question is, 'What are you doing for others?' - Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
  <p>Let me share with you an inspiring story that showcases the power of helping others. A few years ago, there was a man named John that I used to see every day on the way to work. He was always sitting by the side of the road, homeless and begging for food. One day, I decided to stop and talk to him.</p>
  <p>As we talked, I learned that John had lost his job, his wife had left him, and he had no family or friends to support him. He was completely alone and had given up on himself. I knew that I had to do something to help him.</p>
  <p>Over the next few months, I started bringing John food and clothes. I helped him find a job and a place to live. Slowly but surely, John's life started to turn around. He regained his confidence and started to believe in himself again.</p>
  <p>Eventually, John was able to stand on his own two feet. He no longer needed my help but we still keep in touch. He tells me that my kindness and support saved his life. That experience showed me that helping others not only benefits them, but it can also bring immense satisfaction to ourselves too.</p>
  <h2>Martin Luther King Jr. - A Champion of Equality and Justice</h2>
  <p>Martin Luther King Jr. was one of the most prominent civil rights activists of the 20th century. He fought tirelessly to end segregation and discrimination against African-Americans in the United States during the 1950s and 1960s. King firmly believed in the power of nonviolent protests to bring about social change.</p>
  <p>King was inspired by his Christian faith, which taught him to love and serve others. He believed that everyone has a duty to help their fellow human being, regardless of race, religion or nationality.</p>
  <blockquote>
   "Life's most persistent and urgent question is, 'What are you doing for others?'"
  </blockquote>
  <p>King's philosophy of nonviolence is still relevant today. In a world that is becoming increasingly divided and polarized, we need more people like King who can inspire us to love and serve each other.</p>
