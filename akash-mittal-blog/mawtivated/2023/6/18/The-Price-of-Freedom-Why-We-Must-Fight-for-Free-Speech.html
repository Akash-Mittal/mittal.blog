    <h2>An Inspirational Story</h2>
    <p>There once lived a man named Nelson Mandela. He fought his whole life for the freedom of his people. And as he sat in a tiny cell for 27 long years, he knew that his fight for freedom was worth the sacrifice. For he believed that without freedom, life had no meaning. And so, he emerged from his cell with his head held high, ready to continue the fight for his people's freedom.</p>
    <p>His life serves as a reminder that freedom is worth fighting for, even if it means paying a high price.</p>

    <h2>The Price of Free Speech</h2>
    <p>Freedom of speech is a fundamental human right. It is the cornerstone of democracy and is essential for the free exchange of ideas. However, the sad reality is that free speech is under threat today.</p>
    <p>Many people today are afraid to speak their minds for fear of being judged or worse, for fear of being persecuted. Others choose to remain silent, allowing their voices to be stifled by a culture of fear and censorship.</p>
    <p>And yet, we must ask ourselves - at what cost?</p>
    <p>The cost of free speech is high. We have seen people go to prison for expressing their opinions. We have seen magazines and other media outlets shut down for daring to publish a different version of history.</p>
    <p>And why do we allow this to happen? When did we become a society that is willing to sacrifice free speech on the altar of political correctness?</p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>"And why do we, who say we oppose tyranny and demand freedom of speech, allow people to go to prison and be vilified, and magazines to be closed down on the spot, for suggesting another version of history." - David Icke</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>We must remember that the price of freedom is eternal vigilance. We must fight for our right to free speech, even if it means paying a high price. And we must do so now, before it is too late.</p>

    <h2>Examples of Free Speech Under Threat</h2>
    <h3>The case of Charlie Hebdo</h3>
    <p>In 2015, the offices of Charlie Hebdo, a French satirical magazine, were attacked by terrorists who were offended by the magazine's cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed. 12 people were killed in the attack.</p>
    <p>This attack serves as a reminder of the high price of free speech - the cartoonists at Charlie Hebdo paid the ultimate price for expressing their opinions.</p>
    <h3>The Chinese Government's Censorship of the Internet</h3>
    <p>The Chinese government has one of the most extensive censorship systems in the world. The Great Firewall of China blocks access to websites deemed politically sensitive by the government, including sites like Google, Facebook and Twitter.</p>
    <p>This censorship system has been used to stifle free speech and control the flow of information in China.</p>
    <h3>The Censorship of Dr. Seuss</h3>
    <p>In 2021, Dr. Seuss Enterprises announced that it would stop publishing six of Dr. Seuss's books due to racial undertones that were deemed inappropriate. While some argued that the decision was necessary to address racial issues, others saw it as an affront to free speech.</p>
    <p>This case is a reminder of the importance of free speech even when it is uncomfortable or unpopular.</p>
