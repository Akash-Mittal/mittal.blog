   <h2>Understanding the Future</h2>
   <p>The future can be unpredictable, but it's shaped by the things we do today. By understanding current trends and issues, we can identify potential problems and work to prevent them.

   <h2>Anticipating Challenges</h2>
   <p>Preventing the future means anticipating challenges before they become crises. This requires a willingness to think critically and challenge assumptions.
