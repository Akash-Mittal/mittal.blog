    <h3>Inspiring Story:</h3>
    <p>One of the most inspiring stories about modifying ideas in science is that of Louis Pasteur, who discovered that germs were responsible for causing diseases. Before his work, many people believed in the theory of spontaneous generation, which posited that living things could arise from non-living things. Pasteur was ridiculed and criticized for his views, but he persevered and his ideas eventually prevailed. His discoveries revolutionized the field of medicine and saved countless lives.</p>

    <h3>About the Author:</h3>
    <blockquote>
     "I completely agree with the idea that modifying and changing one's ideas as science advances is crucial for progress. My name is Herbert Spencer and I am a biologist and philosopher who wrote extensively about evolution and social Darwinism. I firmly believe that scientific theories must be constantly reevaluated and modified in light of new evidence and discoveries."

     <li>When I was a student in college, I had a professor who was a brilliant scientist but also very open to changing his ideas as new evidence emerged. He would often start a lecture by saying, "This is what we used to believe, but now we know better." His humility and openness to new ideas inspired me to pursue a career in science.</li>
     <li>I have also seen firsthand how difficult it can be for scientists to let go of cherished beliefs. One of my colleagues was convinced that a certain drug was the key to curing a specific disease, even though numerous studies had shown otherwise. He refused to modify his ideas and it ultimately led to his research being discredited.</li>

    <ul>
     <li>Galileo Galilei had to modify the idea that the sun revolved around the Earth when he discovered through his observations that it was actually the other way around.</li>
     <li>The field of genetics has undergone numerous modifications and changes since the discovery of DNA, including the development of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing tool, which could revolutionize medicine.</li>
