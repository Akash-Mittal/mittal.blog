    <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time, there was a young man named David. He came from a poor family and had to work hard to get an education. Despite all the obstacles he faced, David never gave up on his dreams and eventually became a successful businessman. He was proud of his accomplishment, but he also knew that he could never have done it alone. David was grateful for all the people who helped him along the way, but he also knew that he had to be independent if he wanted to continue to succeed.</p>

    <h2>The Issues We Face</h2>
    <p>As Jim DeMint once said, "We lost a lot of our independence already." And it's true. We are becoming increasingly dependent on other countries for our basic needs. Here are just a few examples:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>We are dependent on China for credit</li>
     <li>We are dependent on Middle Eastern countries for energy supplies</li>
     <li>Many Americans are dependent on the government for their income, health care, education of their children, and food stamps</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are just a few examples of the dependence we face as a nation. But what does this mean for our future?</p>

    <h2>The Consequences of Dependence</h2>
    <p>When we become dependent on others, we lose our ability to make our own decisions. We have to rely on others for our basic needs, and this can be dangerous. If those countries or groups decide to cut us off, we are left without any alternatives. This can lead to famine, lack of medical care, and other dire consequences.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, dependence can also lead to a loss of innovation. When we are not forced to find solutions on our own, we don't have the need to be creative or inventive. This can lead to a stagnant economy and a lack of progress in many areas.</p>
    <p>Lastly, dependence can also lead to a loss of freedom. When we are dependent on others, we lose our ability to make our own decisions. We become subject to the whims of those who control our sources of supply, and this can be dangerous for our democracy and our way of life.</p>

    <h2>What Can We Do?</h2>
    <p>Fortunately, there are steps we can take to reduce our dependence on others. Here are a few practical tips:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Invest in renewable energy sources to reduce our dependence on oil from Middle Eastern countries</li>
     <li>Support small businesses and entrepreneurs to diversify our economy</li>
     <li>Encourage personal responsibility and self-sufficiency to reduce dependence on government programs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By taking these steps, we can begin to regain our independence and secure our future as a nation.</p>
