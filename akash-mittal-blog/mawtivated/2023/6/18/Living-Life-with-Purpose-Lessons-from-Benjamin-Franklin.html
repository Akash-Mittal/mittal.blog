   <p>Imagine waking up every morning and the first thing you do is check the obituary page to see if your name is there. If it's not, you get up and start your day. This may sound like a morbid ritual, but it's actually a powerful mindset that can help you live your life with purpose.</p>
   <p>This quote is often attributed to the famous American statesman and inventor, Benjamin Franklin. While there is no concrete evidence that he actually said it, the sentiment behind the words is something that Franklin embodied throughout his life.</p>
   <h2>The Life of Benjamin Franklin</h2>
   <p>Benjamin Franklin was born in Boston in 1706 and came from humble beginnings. He was the fifteenth of seventeen children and left school at the age of ten to work in his family's candle and soap making business.</p>
   <p>Despite his lack of formal education, Franklin was a voracious reader and taught himself through books. He went on to become a successful printer, writer, diplomat, and inventor. Among his many accomplishments, Franklin is perhaps best known for his experiments with electricity and his role in drafting the United States Constitution.</p>
   <blockquote>
    "Dost thou love life? Then do not squander time, for that is the stuff life is made of." - Benjamin Franklin
   </blockquote>
   <h2>The Importance of Living with Purpose</h2>
   <p>One of the key lessons we can learn from Franklin is the importance of living with purpose. He believed that we should always be striving to improve ourselves and our communities through hard work, education, and civic engagement.</p>
   <p>Living with purpose means setting clear goals for yourself and working tirelessly to achieve them. It means taking ownership of your life and making choices that align with your values and vision for the future.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Living with Purpose</h2>
   <p>There are countless examples of individuals who have lived with purpose and made an impact on the world. Some notable examples include:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Mother Teresa, who dedicated her life to helping the poor and sick in India.</li>
    <li>Mahatma Gandhi, who fought for India's independence from British rule through nonviolent resistance.</li>
    <li>Nelson Mandela, who spent twenty-seven years in prison for fighting against apartheid in South Africa before becoming the country's first black president.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>While these individuals may seem like larger-than-life figures, the truth is that anyone can live with purpose. It simply requires a passion for something greater than yourself, a willingness to work hard, and a commitment to making a difference in the world.</p>
