From traditional dishes like pasta al nero di seppia and sarde in saor to sweet indulgences like tiramisù and gelato, Venice has something to satisfy every palate. The city's proximity to the sea also means that seafood is prominently featured on most menus, bringing the freshest catches to your plate. And of course, no visit to Venice is complete without a sip of Spritz, the iconic Venetian aperitivo made with Aperol or Campari, Prosecco, and soda water.</p>

Whether you're taking a gondola ride at sunset, attending the opera at La Fenice, or admiring the masterpieces at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice has a way of making you feel indulged and inspired. And if you're lucky enough to witness the Biennale, the world's oldest and most prestigious contemporary art exhibition, you'll witness Venice's cosmopolitan side and its ability to stay current and relevant.</p><em>"Venice has a way of making you feel indulged and inspired."</em>
