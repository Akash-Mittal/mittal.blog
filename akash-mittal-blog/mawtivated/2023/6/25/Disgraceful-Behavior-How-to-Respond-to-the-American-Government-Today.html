   <h3>The Author - Henry David Thoreau</h3>
   <p>Henry David Thoreau was a philosopher, essayist, and naturalist who is best known for his book, Walden. Thoreau believed that individuals have a moral duty to resist unjust laws. He spent a night in jail for refusing to pay a poll tax that supported slavery and the Mexican War.</p>

   <h3>Background</h3>
   <p>Henry David Thoreau's quote, "How does it become a man to behave towards the American government today? I answer, that he cannot without disgrace be associated with it," is as relevant today as it was in the 19th century. As citizens of a democracy, it is our responsibility to ensure that our government is working for the people and not against them. However, in recent years, we have seen corruption, injustice, and policies that harm marginalized communities. It is essential to understand how we can respond.</p>
