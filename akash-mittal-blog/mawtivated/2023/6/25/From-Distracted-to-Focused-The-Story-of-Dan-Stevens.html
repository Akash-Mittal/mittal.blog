   <p>As a child, Dan Stevens found school to be a frustrating experience. His early school reports were filled with comments like "Daniel must learn not to distract others."</p>
   <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>

   <p>One of Dan's clients, Sarah, had always struggled with staying focused during exams. She would find herself getting distracted by the smallest things, like a ticking clock or a squeaky chair.

   <h3>Example 2:</h3>
   <p>Another client, Jack, found it almost impossible to concentrate on anything for more than a few minutes at a time. He was constantly fidgeting and getting up out of his chair.
