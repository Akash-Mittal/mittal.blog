  </header>
  <main>
   <p>The year was 2007, and a young entrepreneur named Steve Jobs had just announced the launch of the first iPhone. At the time, the idea of a phone that could do everything from making calls to browsing the internet was revolutionary. Many people thought it would never work.</p>
   <p>Fast forward to today, and the iPhone is an essential part of daily life for millions of people around the world. It's just one example of the amazing things that people have achieved, despite the odds.</p>
   <p>As Tim Berners Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web once said, "I suppose it's amazing when you think how many things people get involved in that don't work." But it's equally amazing to think about all the things that do work, and the stories behind them.</p>
   <h3>Tim Berners Lee: Background Story and Achievements</h3>
   <p>Before we dive into inspiring stories of success and overcoming failure, it's important to understand the background of Tim Berners Lee. Born in 1955, he is a British computer scientist who invented the World Wide Web in 1989. Prior to that, he had been working on developing a system for sharing information among researchers, which eventually led to the creation of the web.</p>
   <p>Berners Lee's invention has had a profound impact on the world, enabling people from all walks of life to access information and communicate with each other, in ways that were never possible before. It's just one example of how the determination and hard work of one person can change the world.</p>
   <h3>Examples of Amazing Things that Work</h3>
   <p>There are countless examples of amazing things that people have created, despite the odds. Here are just a few:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>The internet: It's hard to imagine life without the internet these days, but it wasn't always so ubiquitous. The development of the internet required years of hard work and determination, but it has changed the world in ways that we could never have imagined.</li>
    <li>The printing press: Invented by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century, the printing press revolutionized the way that information was shared. It enabled books and newspapers to be produced quickly and efficiently, making knowledge more accessible to the masses.</li>
    <li>The airplane: The Wright brothers are often credited with inventing the first airplane, but their success was the result of years of trial and error. Their dedication to the idea of flight enabled them to achieve what so many others had failed to do.</li>
    <li>The light bulb: Thomas Edison's invention of the light bulb is a perfect example of perseverance in the face of failure. It is said that Edison failed over 1,000 times before finally achieving success.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3> and Case Studies</h3>
   <p>While these examples are certainly inspiring, it's the personal anecdotes and case studies that really illustrate the power of determination and hard work. Here are a few examples:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>JK Rowling: Before she became one of the world's most successful authors, JK Rowling was a struggling single mother who wrote Harry Potter in cafes. She received numerous rejections before finally finding a publisher who believed in her work.</li>
    <li>Steve Jobs: Before he founded Apple, Steve Jobs was a college dropout who traveled to India in search of enlightenment. He was fired from his own company in the 1980s, but went on to revolutionize the world of technology.</li>
    <li>Albert Einstein: It's hard to imagine a more successful scientist than Albert Einstein, but he had his fair share of setbacks. He struggled in school as a child, and was rejected from several universities before finally finding success.</li>
   </ul>
