  <h1>The Inspiring Story of Pluto</h1></br> <img src="images/Why-Pluto-Should-Remain-a-Planet.jpeg" alt="+Why-Pluto-Should-Remain-a-Planet+"></br>
  <p>Pluto, the little planet that could, has always been a mystery to astronomers. Discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh, the distant object was initially hailed as the ninth planet in our solar system. For decades, Pluto was one of the most beloved planets, with kids around the world learning about its icy surface, five moons, and unique orbit. But in 2006, everything changed. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) reclassified Pluto as a "dwarf planet," sparking controversy and debate among scientists and space enthusiasts. Despite this setback, many people, including myself, believe that Pluto should remain a planet.</p>
  <h2>The Story of Jared Leto</h2>
  <p>As an actor, musician, and entrepreneur, Jared Leto is a creative polymath who has always been fascinated by space. He has even named his band "30 Seconds to Mars" after a NASA project. But Leto's interest in space goes beyond just the music and movies he creates. He has spoken publicly about his admiration for Pluto and has criticized the IAU's decision. In an interview with MTV News, Leto said, "I've always liked Saturn. But I also have some sympathy for Pluto because I heard it's been downgraded from a planet, and I think it should remain a planet. Once you've given something planetary status, it's kind of mean to take it away."</p>
  <h2>Why Pluto Deserves to Be a Planet</h2>
  <h3>It Meets the Definition of a Planet</h3>
  <p>The IAU's decision to classify Pluto as a "dwarf planet" was based on new rules for planetary definitions. According to the IAU, a planet must meet three criteria: it must orbit the sun, it must be spherical in shape, and it must have cleared its orbit of other debris. While Pluto meets the first two criteria, it doesn't meet the third. However, many scientists argue that this definition is flawed. Alan Stern, the principal investigator for NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto, has said that the third criterion was "created after the fact" and that "it's not used consistently to classify other planets."</p>
  <h3>It's a Part of Our Cultural Heritage</h3>
  <p>Pluto has been a part of human culture for decades. It has inspired countless songs, movies, and books, and it has captured the imaginations of children and adults alike. Taking away Pluto's planetary status feels like erasing a part of our cultural heritage. It's not just a scientific decision; it's a decision that affects all of us.</p>
  <h3>It Has Scientific Value</h3>
  <p>Despite its small size, Pluto has much to teach us about the solar system and the universe. The New Horizons mission, which flew past Pluto in 2015, revealed a treasure trove of new information, including evidence of a subsurface ocean and active geological processes. These discoveries have sparked new questions and avenues of research, making Pluto an important scientific object.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>Pluto should remain a planet because it meets the scientific definition of a planet.</li>
   <li>Pluto is an important part of human culture and has scientific value.</li>
   <li>We should embrace the mystery and diversity of our solar system, rather than limiting ourselves to strict definitions.</li>
