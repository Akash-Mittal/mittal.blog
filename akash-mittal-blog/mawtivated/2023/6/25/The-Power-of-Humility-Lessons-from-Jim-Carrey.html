   <h2>An Inspiring Story of Staying Grounded</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>Imagine becoming one of the biggest movie stars in the world, with legions of fans, millions of dollars, and adulation everywhere you turn. It would be easy to let all that go to your head, to believe you're invincible and can do anything you want. But not everyone falls into that trap. Some manage to maintain their sense of humility and gratitude, and their contributions to their field are all the richer for it.</p>
   <p>One such person is Jim Carrey. Born in Newmarket, Ontario, Canada, in 1962, Carrey was a natural performer from a young age, making faces and mimicking people to make his friends and family laugh. He began doing stand-up comedy in Toronto in the late 1970s, and by the mid-1980s, he was a regular on TV's <em>The Tonight Show</em> and <em>The Late Show</em>.</p>
   <p>Carrey's big break came when he was cast as the lead in the 1994 movie <em>Ace Ventura: Pet Detective</em>. From there, he went on a hot streak, starring in hit after hit, including <em>The Mask</em>, <em>Dumb and Dumber</em>, <em>Liar Liar</em>, and <em>How the Grinch Stole Christmas</em>. He became known for his rubbery expressions, wild physical comedy, and infectious energy. He won Golden Globe awards for his performances in <em>The Truman Show</em> and <em>Man on the Moon</em>, and in 2020, he starred in the TV series <em>Kidding</em> as a troubled children's TV host.</p>
   <p>But what's perhaps most remarkable about Carrey is that he's remained humble and self-deprecating throughout all his success. Rather than succumbing to the temptation to become drunk with his own power, he's used his fame and wealth to try to make the world a better place, and to inspire others to do the same.</p>
   <h3>Examples of Humility and Gratitude</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Carrey has often spoken about his upbringing as a working-class kid in Canada. He's said that he wanted to become rich and famous not for the money and attention, but so he could help his family and loved ones. He's also credited his father, who once lost his job and had to take a job as a janitor, with teaching him the value of hard work and diligence.</li>
    <li>In his Golden Globe acceptance speech for <em>The Truman Show</em>, Carrey said, "I'd like to thank God first and foremost for giving everybody here me," before launching into a freewheeling monologue about the meaningless of awards and celebrity.</li>
    <li>In 2014, Carrey gave a poignant commencement speech at the Maharishi University of Management in Fairfield, Iowa, in which he talked about his struggle with depression and how he's come to realize that "you are the vanguard of knowledge and consciousness." He encouraged the graduates to pursue their passions and not worry about material success or societal expectations.</li>
    <li>Carrey is an active philanthropist, and has supported numerous charities over the years, including the Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes, the David Lynch Foundation for Consciousness-Based Education and World Peace, and the Best Friends Animal Society. He's also pledged to donate the proceeds from his artwork to various charities.</li>
    <li>In a 2014 interview with <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>, Carrey said, "I think everybody should get rich and famous and do everything they ever dreamed of so they can see that it's not the answer."</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>The Dangers of Power and Ego</h3>
   <p>Jim Carrey's inspiring example stands in stark contrast to many other celebrities and public figures who've let their power and ego get the best of them. We've all seen examples of the "tragic flaw" in action: athletes who cheat, politicians who lie, executives who exploit. These people may have started out with good intentions, but somewhere along the way, they lost sight of what really mattered and got caught up in the trappings of success.</p>
   <p>One of the biggest dangers of power and ego is that they can blind us to our weaknesses and faults. We become so convinced of our infallibility that we think we can do no wrong, and we stop listening to feedback or criticism from others. This can be a recipe for disaster, as we become insulated from reality and make bad decisions that harm ourselves and others.</p>
   <h3>The Importance of Humility and Gratitude</h3>
   <p>So what can we learn from Jim Carrey and other humble, grounded people? How can we cultivate humility and gratitude in our own lives, and avoid the pitfalls of power and ego?</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Remember where you came from. No matter how successful or powerful you become, don't forget your roots. Stay in touch with your family, friends, and community, and don't let fame or fortune change who you are.</li>
    <li>Be open to feedback and criticism. Instead of assuming that you're always right, listen to what others have to say. Seek out constructive criticism from trusted colleagues or advisors, and be willing to learn from your mistakes.</li>
    <li>Use your power and resources for good. Whether you're a CEO, athlete, or artist, you have the ability to make an impact on the world. Don't hoard your wealth or influence; use it to support causes you believe in, help others in need, and create a better future for everyone.</li>
   </ol>
