  <main>
   <p>Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, "All diseases run into one, old age." While it may be inevitable, that doesn't mean we have to simply accept the limitations of aging. This is the story of Maria, who at the age of 75 became a yoga teacher and inspired many others to embrace the power of a healthy, active lifestyle in their golden years.</p>
   <blockquote>
    "I never thought I could do something like this at my age," Maria said. "But I realized that I had more strength and flexibility than I thought. And now I can help others discover that for themselves."
   </blockquote>
   <h2>Age is Just a Number</h2>
   <p>Maria's story is a testament to the fact that age is just a number. Of course, there are inevitable changes that come with aging - our bodies become less agile, our minds may slow down a bit, and we may experience more health issues. But that doesn't mean we can't continue to live a full, active life.</p>
   <p>In fact, staying active is one of the best things we can do for our health as we age. Exercise can help maintain muscle mass and strength, improve bone density, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes. And it's never too late to start - even small changes like taking a daily walk or doing some gentle stretching can make a big difference.</p>
   <h2>Embracing Change</h2>
   <p>Another key to healthy aging is embracing change. As we age, our bodies and minds may not work quite the same as they used to - but that's okay. Instead of fighting against these changes, we can find ways to adapt and accept them. For example, if you're struggling with memory issues, you can start using tools like reminders or lists to help you stay organized. Or, if you're experiencing joint pain, you can try low-impact exercises like swimming or yoga to reduce the impact on your joints.</p>
   <h2>Living with Purpose</h2>
   <p>Ultimately, healthy aging isn't just about physical health - it's also about living with purpose. Studies have shown that having a sense of purpose in life can help us live longer, healthier, and more fulfilling lives. And this doesn't have to mean achieving some grand goal or making some major contribution to society - it can be as simple as finding joy in the small moments of everyday life.</p>

    <li>Age is just a number - we can continue to live a full, active life as we get older.</li>
    <li>Embracing change is key to healthy aging - instead of fighting against it, find ways to adapt to and accept it.</li>
