  <h1>Loved: An Eternal Emotion</h1></br> <img src="images/Loved-An-Eternal-Emotion.jpeg" alt="+Loved-An-Eternal-Emotion+"></br>
  <p>There is a story about a man named John who lost his wife in a tragic car accident. After her death, John felt like a part of him had died too. He didn't know how to move on or even how to live without her. However, as time passed, he realized that even though his wife was no longer physically with him, the love they shared continued to exist.</p>
  <p>Love is an emotion that cannot be measured or quantified. It is an emotion that transcends time, space and even death. As author Ken Kesey once said, "Loved. You can't use it in the past tense. Death does not stop that love at all."</p>
  <p>Kesey's quote is a testament to the power of love. It is an emotion that binds us together, an emotion that connects us with the ones we love and cherish. Love can bring about great joy, but it can also bring about great pain. Nonetheless, the love we feel for another person, be it romantic or platonic, is what makes life worth living.</p>
  <h2>Author - Ken Kesey</h2>
  <p>Ken Kesey was an American writer, best known for his novel "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." The story is a reflection of the counterculture movement of the 1960s and explores the themes of individuality, freedom and the human condition.</p>
  <p>Kesey was a firm believer in the power of love. His works often touched upon the subject, depicting the emotions and feelings associated with it. His words have the power to heal, inspire and comfort.</p>
