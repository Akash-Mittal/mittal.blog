    <h2>How Friendship Can Change Your Life?</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time, there was a boy named Noah who was always alone and had no friends. Despite his talents and kindness, he found it hard to connect with people and often felt sad and isolated.</p>
    <p>One day, he met a girl named Emma, who was new to the town. Despite their differences, they clicked right away and developed a strong bond of friendship. Emma listened to Noah's struggles and supported him through thick and thin.</p>
    <p>With Emma's help, Noah grew more confident and was able to open up to more people. He found new hobbies and interests and discovered a passion for writing. He even started a blog and shared his thoughts and feelings with others.</p>
    <p>Through their friendship, Noah learned that he was not alone and that he had someone who cared for him and believed in him. He found the courage to pursue his dreams and realized that he was capable of making a difference in the world.</p>

    <h2>Who is Lord Byron?</h2>
    <p>Lord Byron was a British poet, politician, and leading figure of the Romantic movement. He was known for his melancholic and emotional poetry, which often touched upon themes of love, loss, and friendship.</p>
    <blockquote>
     "Friendship may, and often does, grow into love, but love never subsides into friendship."
    </blockquote>
    <p>Byron's quote reminds us that friendship is a powerful force that can transform our lives and shape our destinies. It is a bond that goes beyond mere acquaintance or companionship and touches the very core of our being.</p>

    <h2>My Story of Friendship</h2>
    <p>When I was in college, I met a girl named Ava who shared my passion for music and literature. We quickly became close friends and spent many hours discussing our favorite books, movies, and songs.</p>
    <p>Despite our busy schedules and different interests, we always made time for each other and supported each other's dreams. When I was feeling down or discouraged, Ava was always there to lift me up and remind me of my worth.</p>
