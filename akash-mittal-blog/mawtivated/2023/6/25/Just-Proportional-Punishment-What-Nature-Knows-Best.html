   <p>It's a common belief that people should be punished for their wrongdoings. However, the idea of justice has been debated for centuries. How do we measure what punishment is appropriate for a specific crime? Can we trust the judicial system to deliver justice? According to Percy Bysshe Shelley, justice should be left in the hands of nature. In his words, "Only nature knows how to justly proportion to the fault the punishment it deserves."</p>
   <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
   <p>Leila, a single mother, was driving home from work one day when a drunk driver ran a red light and hit her car. Leila suffered severe injuries and had to be hospitalized for weeks. The drunk driver, on the other hand, only suffered minor injuries and was released from the hospital the same day. In court, the driver was sentenced to six months in prison. While Leila appreciated that the driver was punished for his actions, she couldn't help but feel that the punishment was not just proportional to the fault. The driver got off easy compared to what Leila had to go through because of his negligence.</p>
   <h2>Author - Percy Bysshe Shelley Story or Background</h2>
   <p>Percy Bysshe Shelley was an English poet and philosopher who lived in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. He was a prominent member of the Romantic movement, known for his radical ideas and passionate writings. Shelley believed that government and society should be based on justice and equality, and he criticized the institutions of his time for their corruption and oppression. His works often explored the themes of nature, freedom, and individualism.</p>
   <h2>Examples</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>A person who commits tax fraud and is fined a small amount of money compared to the millions they stole.</li>
    <li>A corporation that pollutes the environment and is only fined a small amount of money compared to the damage they caused.</li>
    <li>A person who commits a violent crime and is sentenced to a few years in prison compared to the lifetime of trauma and pain experienced by the victim.</li>
   </ul>
   
   <p>When I was in high school, a classmate of mine was caught cheating on an exam. The school's punishment was a warning and a zero on the test. While some students thought the punishment was too lenient, others thought it was too harsh. In my opinion, the punishment was not just proportional to the fault. The classmate who cheated learned nothing from the punishment and continued to cheat in other classes. I believe a more just punishment would have been to make the student retake the test without cheating and to have a serious conversation with them about the importance of honesty and integrity.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Justice should be based on proportional punishment, meaning that the punishment should fit the crime.</li>
    <li>Human judgments can be biased, corrupt, or misguided, which is why nature might be a better judge when it comes to assessing punishment.</li>
    <li>While some people might argue that proportional punishment is subjective, we can use guiding principles such as harm reduction, rehabilitation, and restitution to determine what punishment is just.</li>
