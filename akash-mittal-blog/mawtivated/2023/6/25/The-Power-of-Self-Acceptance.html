    <h2>The Story of Channing Tatum</h2>
    <p>Channing Tatum, the Hollywood heartthrob who has won the hearts of millions of fans all over the world, had once believed that he was not good-looking enough to be a model. When he was first scouted by the famous modeling agency, Irene Marie, he was in his early 20s and had just graduated from high school. However, he was intimidated by the other models at the agency and did not think that he could make it as a model. In his own words, he thought to himself, "Jesus Christ. I can't do this. I don't look anything like these guys."</p>
    <blockquote>
