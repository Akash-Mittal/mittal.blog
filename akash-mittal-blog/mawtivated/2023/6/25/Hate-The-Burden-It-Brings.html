    <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time,a wise man went to a village. He noticed that a lot of people in that village had a lot of anger, frustration and hatred towards each other.No one wanted to forgive each other. They were always fighting over petty issues and this caused their village to be left behind in terms of growing and developing.</p>
    <p>The wise man decided to teach them a lesson.He took three large pots of boiling water and placed sweet-smelling flowers in them. He gave one pot to his right, another to his left, and the third in the middle. He instructed the villagers to sit around the pots and watch."Do not move the pots, just watch," he said.</p>
    <p>After a while, the wise man said, "Now, go and taste the water from each pot"</p>
    <p>The villagers ran to the pots, but they saw that the water in the pot on the right was absolutely bitter, the water in the pot on the left was extremely sour, but the water in the pot in the middle was sweet like nectar.</p>
    <p>Then the wise man spoke, "This is similar to our lives. We are the pots and the situations around us are the source of the fire that boils us. The flowers are the good things in our lives. If we keep the good things with us, what boils out of us is sweet and amazing. But if we allow the fire to boil us and we keep all the negativity, hatred, and grudges in us, then bitterness, jealousy and hate are what boil out of us."</p>
    <p>The lesson the wise man taught the villagers that day was to let go of hatred because it is too great a burden to bear</p>

    <h2>Coretta Scott King - The Story</h2>
    <p>The wife of Martin Luther King Jr., Coretta Scott King, who was herself an advocate for civil rights, once said, "Hate is too great a burden to bear. It injures the hater more than it injures the hated."</p>
    <p>Coretta Scott King experienced hatred firsthand, but she did not allow that hatred to consume her. Instead, she channeled that energy into her activism, fighting for civil rights and equality for all.</p>
    <p>The message that King shared still holds true today â€“ hate is not only detrimental to the person it is aimed at, but also to the person who carries it.</p>

    <p>I remember a time when I was holding a grudge against someone. It was a small issue, but I could not bring myself to forgive them. It was weighing me down, and I was feeling miserable every day. One day, a friend pointed out that it was only me who was being hurt by this grudge, and that the other person probably wasn't even aware of it. That realization hit me hard, and I decided to forgive and let go. It was liberating, and I felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders.</p>
    <p>Holding onto hatred and grudges only causes pain and suffering. It is important to realize that forgiveness is not just for the other person, but for ourselves as well.</p>
