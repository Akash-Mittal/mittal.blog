  <p>Once upon a time, there was a man named John who was born with a physical disability that made him feel inferior to others. His parents, siblings, and friends tried their best to uplift his spirit, but John remained gloomy and insecure. One day, he stumbled upon a book that he found in the library. It was a collection of short stories that captured his imagination and sparked his sense of humor. As he continued reading, John realized that these two gifts could compensate him for what he was not and console him for what he was.</p>
