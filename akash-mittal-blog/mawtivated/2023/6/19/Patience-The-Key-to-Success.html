    <p>Have you ever heard the story of Colonel Sanders who founded KFC? He had to face multiple failures and rejections before finally achieving success. He was 62 years old when he started his business, after years of struggling with odd jobs and living on a meager pension. But he never lost patience and kept trying until his recipe became a worldwide sensation.</p>
    <p>Patience is a quality that we often overlook, but it is essential for achieving success. It is the ability to wait calmly and persistently for something that we desire and is worth waiting for. It is not a passive quality, but an active one that requires determination, perseverance, and faith in oneself.</p>
    <p>As Larry Hagman rightly said, "There are very little things in this life I cannot afford and patience is one of them." Patience may seem like a luxury in today's fast-paced world, but it is actually a necessary ingredient for personal and professional growth.</p>
    <h2>Why Patience is Important?</h2>
    <ol>
     <li><strong>Builds Resilience:</strong> Patience helps us to face setbacks and failures without losing hope. It teaches us to persist in the face of adversity and bounce back stronger.</li>
     <li><strong>Helps to Make Better Decisions:</strong> Patience allows us to step back and analyze the situation more objectively. It prevents us from making impulsive decisions that we may regret later.</li>
     <li><strong>Strengthens Relationships:</strong> Patience is the hallmark of a healthy and fulfilling relationship. It helps us to communicate better, listen attentively and resolve conflicts amicably.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
    <p>Let us look at some real-life examples of people who achieved success through patience:</p>
