   <p>When I was young, my father used to take me to his small business office in the heart of Virginia. Every time I walked into that office, I marveled at all the work that he and his small team put in to grow the business. It was through that experience that I learned the value of hard work and accountability. What he taught me was that every penny spent had to be counted for and every effort had to be directed towards the success of the business.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, the same principles are not being applied to government spending. The GAO just released a report that said 22 percent of federal programs fail to meet their objectives. The truth is we don't know how taxpayer money is spent in Washington, D.C., which is why I think we ought to put every agency budget up on the Internet for everyone to see.</p>
   <p>The internet has the potential to provide transparency and accountability in government spending. With budgets online, citizens would be able to see exactly where their tax dollars are going and how effectively they are being spent. This would not only provide an increased level of transparency but would also allow taxpayers to hold their leaders responsible for budgetary decisions.</p>
   <h2>Examples</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) spent $36 million on a scholarship program but only managed to give out around $1.5 million in scholarships. The rest of the money went towards overhead costs and salaries.</li>
    <li>The Department of Defense (DOD) spent $43 million on a gas station in Afghanistan that should have cost around $500,000.</li>
    <li>The Department of State spent $630,000 on social media campaigns to increase the number of likes to their Facebook pages but the money was spent on fake likes originating from foreign countries and not on actual engagement or promotion of their brand.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>These examples demonstrate the need for increased transparency and accountability in government spending. Citizens need to know where their hard-earned money is going and whether it is being spent effectively. Putting every agency budget online would go a long way towards achieving this transparency and accountability.</p>
   
   <p>As a former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, I understand the importance of being accountable for spending. I was responsible for a budget of over $80 billion and every decision made with that money had to be justified with data and a clear understanding of how it would lead to the growth of the company.</p>
   <p>As I entered the world of politics, I was shocked at how little accountability there was for government spending. It was far too easy for government officials to justify wasteful spending without providing any evidence of its effectiveness. When I ran for president, I made it a mission to increase transparency and accountability in government spending by proposing that all agency budgets be made available online.</p>
   <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Call your elected officials and ask them to increase transparency and accountability in government spending.</li>
    <li>Stay informed about how your hard-earned tax dollars are being spent.</li>
    <li>Pay attention to local budgets and attend city council meetings to voice your opinion on budget decisions.</li>
    <li>Advocate for increased transparency and accountability in government spending online and through social media.</li>
   </ul>
