  <p>Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there lived a young couple named Adam and Eve. They were deeply in love with each other, so much so that their family and friends often joked that they were crazy. They went to great lengths to show their love, whether it was traveling miles just to spend a few moments together or writing love letters at odd hours of the night. People often wondered why they went to such extremes, but Adam and Eve knew that this was the only way they could express their love to each other.</p>
  <p>This story perfectly exemplifies the quote by Pedro Calderon de la Barca, "When love is not madness, it is not love." Love is a feeling that is beyond reason, beyond logic, and beyond explanation. It makes you do things that may seem crazy to others, yet to you, they are perfectly normal because you're doing them for the one you love.</p>
  <h2 style="font-size:28px;">Who is Pedro Calderon de la Barca?</h2>
  <p>Pedro Calderon de la Barca was a Spanish dramatist, poet, and writer who lived during the Golden Age of Spanish literature. He was born in Madrid in 1600 and wrote more than 120 plays during his lifetime. Some of his most famous works include "The Great Theater of the World," "Life is a Dream," and "The Mayor of Zalamea." His writings often explored the themes of love, honor, and faith, and his plays were noted for their poetic language and imaginative staging.</p>

So, embrace the madness and let your love shine brightly!</p>
