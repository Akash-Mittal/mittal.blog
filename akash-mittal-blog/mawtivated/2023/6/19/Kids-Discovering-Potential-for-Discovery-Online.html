   <h2>Author Story - Daniel Greenberg</h2>
   <p>Daniel Greenberg is an education strategist who has worked to make the traditional mode of learning more innovative and interactive for children. He firmly believes that a child's curiosity and enthusiasm are the driving force behind their learning, which makes them more receptive to exploring beyond the boundaries of their curriculum.</p>
   <p>With the evolution of the internet, he noticed a gradual shift in the way children gather information. They are no longer solely dependent on textbooks and teachers for acquiring knowledge. The potential for discovery online has become a fundamental resource for children to explore their interests and indulge in lifelong learning.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Potential for Discovery Online</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Khan Academy - An online platform that offers free courses and tutorials to supplement children's academic understanding and expand their knowledge requires no registration or fee and benefits millions of people every month.</li>
    <li>Codecademy - A fun online platform for children to learn coding, which is a skill that is increasingly in demand. Many children use this website to learn to code and make their fun web games.</li>
    <li>Virtual Field Trips - Online tours of some of the world's most fascinating places are available to children, who can visit the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Great Wall of China, or the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt with just a few clicks, all from the comfort of their homes.</li>
    <li>Safe Social Media - There are many social media platforms tailor-made for children that provide educational content, allows for creativity, sharing interests, explorations, connecting with other children, and build their own communities online. Examples include Scramblr, Kidzworld, and ever-popular Moshi Monsters.</li>
   </ul>
   
   <p>Samantha, a 15-year-old student from Vancouver, Canada, has always been fascinated by space exploration and astronomy. Her school's curriculum only briefly covered the topic, but Samantha was eager to learn more.</p>
   <p>So, she began exploring various websites, educational videos, and social media pages dedicated to astronomy. She joined online communities where people interested in space exploration would share their experiences and knowledge. Samantha also started attending webinars on topics like space travel, the Big Bang, and the life cycle of stars.</p>
   <p>Today, Samantha is an active member of several space exploration groups online, and she takes part in online projects led by eminent scientists in this field. She credits her online learning experience as the reason behind her passion for astronomy.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>The internet provides a wealth of resources and opportunities for children to discover their passions and interests.</li>
    <li>Caregivers should guide children in using safe online platforms and make sure they don't spend too much time online.</li>
    <li>Online learning should supplement traditional learning - not replace it. Children should be encouraged to engage in outdoor activities, sports and face to face personal interaction with peers.</li>
   </ul>
