  <h1>Don't Deprive Yourself of Any Food: The Joely Fisher Story</h1></br> <img src="images/Don-t-Deprive-Yourself-of-Any-Food-The-Joely-Fisher-Story.jpeg" alt="+Don-t-Deprive-Yourself-of-Any-Food-The-Joely-Fisher-Story+"></br>
  <p>As a young girl, Joely Fisher watched her mother, Connie Stevens, struggle with her weight. She saw her mother try every diet under the sun, from low-carb to low-fat to liquid diets. But none of them seemed to work in the long-term.</p>
  <p>After years of watching her mother deprive herself of certain foods and restrict her intake, Joely Fisher decided that she didn't want to live that way. She wanted to enjoy all different types of foods without feeling guilty or ashamed.</p>
  <p>Today, Joely Fisher is a well-known actress and singer, and she's never followed a strict diet in her life. She firmly believes that deprivation is not the answer when it comes to achieving a healthy lifestyle. In her own words, "I don't believe in depriving myself of any food or being imprisoned by a diet."</p>
  <h2>Don't be Imprisoned by a Diet</h2>
  <p>Joely Fisher's philosophy is simple: don't cut out any foods entirely. Instead, eat everything in moderation, and pay attention to your body's signals to determine what works for you.</p>
  <p>When we're on a strict diet, we often become so focused on the foods we can't eat that we forget to listen to our bodies. We ignore hunger cues and feel guilty when we indulge in a "forbidden" food. This can lead to a negative relationship with food, and it can also make it harder to maintain a healthy weight in the long-term.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Instead of depriving yourself of your favorite foods, allow yourself to indulge in moderation.</li>
   <li>Try to eat a balanced diet that includes a variety of healthy foods.</li>
   <li>Listen to your body's signals to determine when you're full.</li>
  </ul>
