   <p style="text-align:justify;">Many cultures and religions view death as an end to life, a great unknown that is feared and avoided. However, Goddess religion views death in an entirely different way. Rather than being seen as a final end, in Goddess religion, death is viewed as a natural part of life that is followed by birth and renewal.</p>
   <p style="text-align:justify;">Underneath the many different traditions and practices of Goddess religion lies a common belief in the wisdom of the natural cycles of birth, life, death, and rebirth. The cycles of the seasons, the cycles of the moon, the cycles of plant growth and decay, and the cycles of human life are all seen as part of this larger cycle of birth, life, death, and rebirth.</p>

   <h2 style="text-align:center;">The Story of Carol P. Christ</h2>
   <p style="text-align:justify;">Carol P. Christ is a scholar, feminist, and author who has written extensively about Goddess religion. Early in her life, Carol's mother died of cancer. This loss was a defining event that led Carol to question the ways in which death was understood and talked about in her own culture.</p>
   <p style="text-align:justify;">As Carol delved deeper into her studies, she discovered Goddess religion and found there a new perspective on death. In Goddess religion, death is seen not as an end, but as a natural part of the larger cycle of life. This understanding helped Carol to process her mother's death and to feel a sense of hope and renewal.</p>

   <h2 style="text-align:center;">Examples of Death as Part of Life in Goddess Religion</h2>
   <p style="text-align:justify;">One of the most powerful symbols of death and rebirth in Goddess religion is the cycle of the seasons. Each year, as the weather turns colder and the daylight hours grow shorter, we witness the death of the old year and the birth of the new. Winter gives way to spring, and the cycle of life and growth begins anew.</p>
   <p style="text-align:justify;">Another example of death and rebirth in Goddess religion is the cycle of the moon. The full moon is a symbol of abundance and life, but it is followed by the waning moon, which represents the decline of life and the approach of death. However, this is followed once again by the new moon, representing new beginnings and the potential for growth.</p>
