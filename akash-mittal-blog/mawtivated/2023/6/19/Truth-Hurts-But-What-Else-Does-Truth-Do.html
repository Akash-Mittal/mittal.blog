  <p>Have you ever heard of the story of Teena Marie? She was an American singer-songwriter who was often referred to as the <span class="bold">"Ivory Queen of Soul"</span>, due to her mixed-race background and powerful vocal range.</p>
  <p>Teena Marie's success in the music industry was not without its struggles. She was often criticized for not looking like the typical R&amp;B or soul artist, due to her light skin color. However, instead of trying to hide her true identity, Teena Marie chose to embrace it and use it to her advantage.</p>
  <blockquote>
   "I'm a black artist with white skin. At the end of the day, you have to sing what's in your own soul."
  </blockquote>
