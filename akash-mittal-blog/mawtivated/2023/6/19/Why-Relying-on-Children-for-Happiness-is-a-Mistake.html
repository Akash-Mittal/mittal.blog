   <h2>The Inspiring Story of Jane</h2>
   <p>Jane had always wanted children. She dreamed of a big, loving family that would bring her joy and happiness. And when she had her first child, she truly felt like her dreams had come true. But as the years went on, she found herself increasingly resentful and unhappy. Her children were growing up and becoming their own people, with their own dreams and desires that didn't always align with hers. She felt like her life was slipping away, and she couldn't understand why.</p>
   <p>It wasn't until she talked to a therapist that she realized she had been relying on her children for her own happiness. She had put all her hopes and dreams into them, and when they didn't fulfill her expectations, she was left feeling lost and unfulfilled. With the help of her therapist, she began to focus on her own passions and interests, and rediscovered a sense of purpose in her life.</p>
   <h2>Why Relying on Children is a Mistake</h2>
   <p>Dennis Prager, author of the above quote, believes that parents who rely on their children for happiness make both their children and themselves miserable. There are a number of reasons for this:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Children grow up and become their own people.</strong> They may not share the same dreams and desires as their parents, and that's okay. It's not fair to expect them to fulfill our own unmet aspirations, or to make us happy.</li>
    <li><strong>Parents need to find their own sense of purpose and fulfillment.</strong> Children can bring joy and fulfillment, but they cannot be the sole source of it. Parents who neglect their own interests and passions may find themselves feeling lost and unfulfilled, even resentful of their children for "taking away" their own lives.</li>
    <li><strong>Children can be a source of stress and unhappiness.</strong> Raising children is hard work, and it's not always sunshine and rainbows. Parents who expect their children to make them happy all the time are setting themselves up for disappointment and frustration.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Overall, relying on children for happiness is a recipe for disappointment and unhappiness. Parents need to find their own sense of fulfillment and purpose outside of their children, while still maintaining a loving and supportive relationship with them.</p>
   <h2>Practical Tips for Finding Fulfillment Outside of Children</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Find a hobby or activity that brings you joy and fulfillment, whether it's painting, hiking, or volunteering at a local charity.</li>
    <li>Cultivate friendships and relationships outside of your family. It's important to have a support system that doesn't rely solely on your relationship with your children.</li>
    <li>Consider seeking counseling or therapy to help you identify and work through any unresolved issues or unmet desires.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, while children can bring immense joy and fulfillment to our lives, relying on them for happiness is a recipe for disappointment and unhappiness. Parents need to find their own sense of purpose and fulfillment, while maintaining a loving and supportive relationship with their children. By focusing on our own passions and interests, we can rediscover a sense of purpose and fulfillment in our lives that goes beyond our relationship with our children.</p>
