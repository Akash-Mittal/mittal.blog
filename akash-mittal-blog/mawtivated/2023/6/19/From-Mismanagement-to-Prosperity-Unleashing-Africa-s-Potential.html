   <h3>An Inspiring Story of Wangari Maathai</h3>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>The story of Wangari Maathai is a story of resilience, determination, and hope. Born to a poor family in rural Kenya, Wangari faced many obstacles on her path to success. However, she refused to let these obstacles define her future. Instead, she used her education to empower herself and her community.</p>
   <p>After completing her studies in Kenya and the US, Wangari returned to Kenya with a clear vision: to plant trees and improve the environment. She believed that protecting the environment was not only essential for the well-being of people but also for the economic development of her country.</p>
   <p>Despite facing opposition from the government, Wangari continued to plant trees and educate her fellow citizens about the importance of environmental conservation. Her work soon gained recognition and she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2004.</p>
   <h2>The Role of Education and Management in Africa's Economic Development</h2>
   <p>Wangari Maathai's story highlights the importance of education in Africa's economic development. Education is the foundation of human capital, the knowledge, skills, and technology that people need to be able to use Africa's abundant resources effectively and gain wealth.</p>
   <p>However, education alone is not enough. Mismanagement of the economy and poor governance have been the major obstacles to Africa's prosperity. Many African countries are rich in natural resources, yet they remain among the poorest in the world.</p>
   <p>In order to address this challenge, African leaders need to prioritize good governance and sound economic policies. They need to invest in infrastructure, such as roads, water supply, and energy, which are critical for economic growth. They also need to create an enabling environment for businesses to thrive and create job opportunities for their people.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Successful Economic Development in Africa</h2>
   <p>Despite the challenges, there are examples of successful economic development in Africa. One such example is Rwanda, which has emerged as one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa in recent years. The country has made significant progress in reducing poverty, improving access to education and healthcare, and promoting gender equality.</p>
   <p>Rwanda's success is attributed to its focus on good governance and sound economic policies. The government has invested heavily in infrastructure, such as roads and ICT, and has created a favorable environment for businesses to operate.</p>
   <p>Another example is Ethiopia, which has achieved remarkable progress in reducing poverty and improving access to education and healthcare. The country has invested heavily in infrastructure and has been able to attract significant foreign investment.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, Africa has the potential to become a prosperous continent. However, this requires good governance, sound economic policies, and investment in education and infrastructure. African leaders need to prioritize these areas if they want to unlock Africa's potential for economic development.</p>
