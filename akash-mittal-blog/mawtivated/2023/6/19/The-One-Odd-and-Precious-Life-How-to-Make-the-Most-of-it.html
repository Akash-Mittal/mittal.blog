    <p>John always dreamed of becoming a musician but he never pursued his passion. He was too scared of failing, too scared of what people might say and too scared of not being able to make a living out of it. So he settled for a corporate job which paid well but left him feeling unfulfilled.</p>
    <p>One day, he stumbled upon the quote by Anne Lamott:</p>
    <blockquote>
     "Your problem is how you are going to spend this one odd and precious life you have been issued."
    </blockquote>
    <p>The words hit him like a ton of bricks. John realized that he had been given only one life and he had been wasting it. From that moment on, he decided to start from scratch and pursue his passion for music, no matter what the outcome was. It was the best decision he had ever made.</p>
