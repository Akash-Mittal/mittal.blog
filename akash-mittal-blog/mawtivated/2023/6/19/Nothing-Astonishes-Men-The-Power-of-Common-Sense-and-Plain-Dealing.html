  <p>Once upon a time, there was a small business owner named John. Every day, he would wake up early and go to his shop to sell his products. He always believed that honesty and common sense were the keys to success, but he never expected it to truly work.</p>
  <p>One day, a customer came to his store and asked for a product that John knew was not suitable for his needs. Despite the potential loss of money, John decided to tell the customer the truth. The customer was pleasantly surprised and impressed by John's honesty. He ended up buying a different product and recommended John's store to his friends.</p>
  <p>From that day onwards, John's business grew rapidly, thanks to his reputation for common sense and plain dealing.</p>
