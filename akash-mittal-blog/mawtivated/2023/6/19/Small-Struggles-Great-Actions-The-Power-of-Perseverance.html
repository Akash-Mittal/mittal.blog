    <h2>The Story of Victor Hugo</h2>
    <p>Victor Hugo was a French novelist, poet and dramatist who is considered one of the greatest and most well-known writers of all time. He is best known for his novels like "Les Misérables" and "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame". However, his success did not come easily. During his time at school, Victor Hugo's teachers often criticized his writing and gave him poor grades. Nevertheless, he did not give up. Instead, he continued to write and read voraciously, honing his skills and developing his own unique style.</p>

    <h2>The Power of Small Struggles</h2>
    <p>Many people assume that great actions require great struggles – that you have to do something monumental or heroic to make a real difference in the world. However, the truth is that many great actions are the result of small, consistent efforts or struggles. Each small step taken towards a lasting accomplishment is an achievement by itself.</p>
    <p>Take Victor Hugo's story, for example. It was not a single great struggle that led to his success but rather a series of small ones. It was the daily practice of reading, writing, and improving that helped him become a celebrated author. Each time he wrote something, he was taking a small step towards his ultimate goal.</p>
