    <h2>Author Background: Jimmy Carter</h2>
    <p>James Earl "Jimmy" Carter Jr. was born on October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia. He served as the 39th president of the United States from 1977 to 1981, after winning the 1976 presidential election against the incumbent, Gerald Ford. After leaving office, he continued to work on various humanitarian and diplomatic efforts, including the founding of the Carter Center, a non-profit organization focused on promoting democracy, human rights, and public health around the world.</p>
    <p>Carter is also a devout Christian, who has often spoken about his faith and its influence on his life and work. He once famously said, "I have one life and one chance to make it count for something. . . . My faith demands that I do whatever I can, wherever I am, whenever I can, for as long as I can, with whatever I have, to try to make a difference."</p>

    <h2>Lessons from the Bible</h2>
    <p>In an interview with Oprah Winfrey, Carter once said, "I don't claim to be knowledgeable about theology. Most of my knowledge comes out of my experience and the lessons in the Bible." As a Sunday school teacher, he has had the opportunity to share his insights and perspectives on the Bible with others. He has also written several books on the subject, including "Through the Year with Jimmy Carter," which features lessons based on his weekly teachings.</p>
    <p>One of the main lessons that Carter emphasizes is the importance of love. He believes that all of the teachings in the Bible ultimately boil down to this one fundamental principle. As he wrote in a 2012 essay for The Washington Post, "The essence of Christianity is to love one another, not just those who love you in return."</p>
    <p>Another lesson that Carter often talks about is the idea of humility. He believes that it is important to admit one's own faults and limitations, and to be open to learning from others. In a 2014 interview with CBS News, he said, "I think the most important quality of a human being is to be humble, and to realize that we're not perfect."</p>
    <p>Carter also encourages others to be compassionate and to show kindness to others, especially those who are less fortunate. He has been actively involved in humanitarian work through the Carter Center and other organizations, and he believes that we all have a responsibility to help those in need. As he wrote in the introduction to his book "Through the Year with Jimmy Carter," "We must be compassionate, forgiving, and supportive to those around us, for these positive values and attitudes bring true joy and happiness to our lives."</p>
