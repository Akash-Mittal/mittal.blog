    <h2>The Story of Author - Simone Weil</h2>
    <p>Before we dive into the main topic, let's take a look at the story of Simone Weil. She was a French philosopher, mystic, and political activist. Weil attended the prestigious École Normale Supérieure, where she studied philosophy and earned a degree in teaching. Her first job was teaching philosophy, but due to her poor health, she had to quit. She then worked as a factory laborer and a farmhand. Finally, she became a writer and developed her philosophical and political ideas. Her works include 'The Need for Roots', 'Gravity and Grace', and 'The Iliad, or the Poem of Force'.</p>

    <h2>The Pettiness of Greatness</h2>
    <p>The quotation mentioned at the beginning of this article is by Simone Weil. She believed that the greatness of a person lies in their work, and to separate them from their works would only highlight their pettiness. We often see this in our society, where people tend to focus more on the personal lives of celebrities and public figures rather than their work.</p>
    <h3></h3>
    <p>To illustrate this point, let me share a personal anecdote. I once attended a book signing event of a famous author, and while waiting in line, I overheard some people discussing the author's personal life. They were discussing his divorce, his past relationships, and his controversial statements on social media. It was disheartening to hear that none of them were interested in the book itself, which was the reason why they were there in the first place.</p>
    <h3>Case Studies</h3>
    <p>Another example is the case of Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple Inc. He was known for his innovation, creativity, and leadership. However, his personal life was not as glorious. He was a difficult person to work with, had a strained relationship with his daughter, and was often involved in legal disputes. Despite that, his work and contributions to the tech industry continue to inspire millions of people.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, we should not judge the greatness of a person by their personal life but by their work. We should appreciate the contributions that they have made to society and focus on that.
