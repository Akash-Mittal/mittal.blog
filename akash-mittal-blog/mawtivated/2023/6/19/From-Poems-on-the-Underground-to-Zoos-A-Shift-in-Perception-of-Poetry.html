  <h2>A Shift in Perception of Poetry</h2>
  <p>Several years ago, a young girl from a remote village in rural India had never read or heard a poem before. She couldn't even read or write, and her life was nothing but a constant struggle. One day, while wandering around a busy city, she stumbled upon a subway station where she saw something that would change her life forever – poems on the underground.</p>
  <p>These poems had been put up as part of a project aimed at making poetry more accessible to the general public. The young girl was captivated, and she spent several hours just standing there, reading and reciting the verses. She didn't understand everything she read, but the sound of the words, the rhythm, and the emotion they conveyed overwhelmed her. She felt a connection to the world that she had never felt before, and it gave her hope, inspiration, and a reason to dream.</p>
  <p>This incident is just one of the many examples that show how much of an impact poetry can have on people's lives. In recent years, there has been a gigantic shift in the way poetry is perceived, thanks partly to the kind of poets we now have and partly to funding. Poetry is no longer seen as an elite or academic pursuit, but as something that everyone can enjoy and benefit from. Poems on the Underground, poets in schools, football clubs, zoos – we see poetry being integrated into all aspects of society and culture.</p>
  <blockquote>
   "Poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility."
  </blockquote>
  <p>One of the key figures responsible for this shift is Andrew Motion, former Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom. Motion's tenure was marked by a determination to bring poetry to the people. He initiated several projects that aimed to make poetry more accessible, such as ‘The Poetry Archive', ‘Poems on the Underground', ‘Poetry by Heart', and ‘Poetry Together'. These projects have been hugely successful in reaching out to wider audiences, especially young people, and in making them more interested in and engaged with poetry.</p>
  <p>But accessibility is not the only reason for the resurgence of poetry. There is also a growing appreciation of its value in terms of creativity, self-expression, and mental health. Studies have shown that reading and writing poetry can have a positive impact on our emotional and psychological well-being, and can even enhance cognitive functions such as memory and problem-solving. This has led to a greater emphasis on poetry in therapeutic settings and personal development courses.</p>
  <h3>Examples of the New Perception of Poetry</h3>
  <p>Here are some examples of how poetry is being integrated into various aspects of society:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>Poems on the Underground:</strong> Started in 1986, this project has put up over 500 poems on the walls of London's underground trains, exposing millions of commuters to poetry.</li>
   <li><strong>Poetry in Schools:</strong> Many schools now have poets in residence who offer workshops, readings, and advice to students and teachers. Some schools even have their own poetry slams and festivals.</li>
   <li><strong>Poetry and Sports:</strong> Football clubs such as Arsenal, Chelsea, and Everton have commissioned poets to write poems about their teams and fans. This has helped to bridge the gap between sports and culture, and to create a sense of community around them.</li>
   <li><strong>Poetry and Zoos:</strong> Several zoos around the world have poetry contests and events, encouraging visitors to appreciate the beauty and fragility of nature. Poems written by visitors are often displayed on boards or online.</li>
  </ul>
