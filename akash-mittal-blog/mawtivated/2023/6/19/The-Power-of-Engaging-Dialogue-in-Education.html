   <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>Author - William Glasser, an American psychiatrist and author, once shared a story about a teacher who made a profound impact on his life. The teacher, whom he referred to as Mr. Smith, promoted open communication and encouraged his students to think critically. One day, Mr. Smith posed a question to the class, "What is the meaning of life?" The students were initially stumped but were pushed to engage in dialogue and reflect on their values and beliefs. It was a pivotal moment for Glasser, who realized the importance of fostering dialogue in education.</p>
   <p>At the heart of all good education lies this same principle - the teacher asks students to think and engages them in encouraging dialogues, constantly checking for understanding and growth. This method of education aims to inspire lifelong learning and critical thinking skills.</p>
