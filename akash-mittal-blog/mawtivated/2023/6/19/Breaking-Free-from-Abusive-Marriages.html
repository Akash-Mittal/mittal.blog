   <h2>Breaking Free from Abusive Marriages</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>Marriage is supposed to be a blissful union between two people in love. Unfortunately, for some of us, this isn't always the case. My name is Joyce Banda, and I was one of the unlucky ones. I got married at 22, hoping for a happy ever after. Instead, I found myself trapped in a physically and mentally abusive marriage for 10 years.</p>
   <p>Back then, walking out of an abusive marriage, especially in the society I lived in, was unheard of. People often put the blame on the victim, asking what they did to deserve the abuse or why they stayed for so long. But it was never that simple. The truth is, leaving was never an easy decision to make. It came with so many what-ifs, including the fear of being alone and not knowing what the future holds.</p>
   <p>For me, the turning point came when I realized that I wasn't ready to spend the rest of my life in misery. I knew that I had to make a brave step and walk out before it was too late. It wasn't going to be easy, but I had to take that leap of faith, even if it meant going against everything I've ever known.</p>
   <p>Leaving wasn't just about walking away physically; it was also about breaking free mentally. For years, my abuser had planted the seeds of doubt and fear in my mind, making me believe that I was worthless and nobody would want me. But I knew that it was all a lie, and I couldn't let his words define who I was.</p>
   <p>So, I left.</p>
   <blockquote><em>"When you leave an abusive relationship, you have to rewrite your story."</em>
   </blockquote>
   <p>Starting over wasn't easy. It was a journey of self-discovery and healing that took time and patience. But I knew that it was worth it. I found the strength to let go of the past and embrace a better future. Today, I'm proud to say that I'm happily married to the love of my life, and I have never been happier.</p>
   <h2>Breaking Free: What You Need to Know</h2>

    <li>It's not your fault. No one deserves to be abused, and you are not to blame for what's happening to you.</li>
    <li>You deserve better. You deserve to be loved, respected, and treated with dignity and kindness.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Breaking free is a choice that only you can make. It will require courage, strength, and determination, but I assure you that it's possible. You have the power to change your story and start anew. It won't be easy, but it will be worth it.</p>
