  <p>Sports have always been a powerful tool for empowering women and promoting gender equality.

Angela Ruggiero, a former Olympic ice hockey player and the current CEO of the Women's Sports Foundation, knows all too well the transformative power of sports. Her story is one of perseverance, courage, and leadership.</p>
  <h2>An Inspiring Story: Breaking Barriers in Ice Hockey</h2>
  <p>Angela Ruggiero began playing ice hockey at the age of six. She grew up in a family of athletes, and her parents encouraged her to pursue her dreams of playing hockey. It wasn't always easy, though. Ruggiero faced many obstacles as a female hockey player, including discrimination and lack of funding for women's sports.</p>
  <p>Despite the challenges, Ruggiero continued to pursue her passion for hockey. She played for the Harvard Crimson women's ice hockey team and represented the United States at four Olympic games. She won a gold medal in 1998, a silver in 2002 and 2010, and a bronze in 2006.</p>

As the CEO of the Women's Sports Foundation, she continues to promote gender equality and create new opportunities for women and girls in sports. Her mission is to empower women of all abilities to be active and compete, whether recreationally or professionally.</p>
