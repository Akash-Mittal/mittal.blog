   <p>When I was young, I used to sneak out of bed after my parents had gone to sleep to watch horror movies on the television. It started with the classic Universal monster movies of the 1930s and 1940s and eventually progressed to the more intense and gory films of the 1970s and 1980s. I loved the rush of adrenaline that came from being scared, and it's a feeling that has stayed with me throughout my life.</p>
   <p>As an adult, I find it hard to come across shows that can scare me for more than a few seconds. That's not to say that there aren't good horror shows out there, but it takes something special to give me the kind of thrill that I used to get from those old monster movies; something that makes my heart race and my palms sweat.</p>
   <h3>The Thrill is Gone</h3>
   <p>As we get older, it can become harder to find things that truly scare us. We become desensitized to the frights that used to keep us up at night, and it takes something truly exceptional to break through that barrier. It's not that we don't want to be scared, but we've seen so much that it's hard to find something that can shock us anymore.</p>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>Examples</strong></li>
    <p>Some examples of shows that have succeeded in scaring me as an adult include:</p>
    <ul>
     <li><em>The Walking Dead</em> - This show had some truly terrifying moments in its early seasons.</li>
     <li><em>The Haunting of Hill House</em> - This Netflix series managed to keep me on the edge of my seat throughout its entire run.</li>
     <li><em>American Horror Story</em> - While not every season is a winner, this show has managed to scare me more than a few times.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong></strong></li>
    <p>One experience that sticks out in my mind is watching <em>The Exorcist</em> for the first time as an adult. While I had seen the movie before, it had been years since my last viewing. I went in thinking that I knew what to expect, but I was wrong. The movie scared me in a way that I hadn't been scared in ages. It was a pleasant reminder that, no matter how jaded we become, there's always something out there that can scare us.</p>
    <li><strong>Tips for Finding Scary Shows</strong></li>
    <p>If you're struggling to find shows that can scare you as an adult, here are a few tips:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Look for shows that are rated R or TV-MA. These shows are more likely to have intense and scary content.</li>
     <li>Don't be afraid to branch out into international offerings. There are some great horror shows coming out of places like South Korea and Japan.</li>
     <li>Try not to watch too many trailers before diving into a show. Sometimes, going in blind can be the best way to experience a scary story.</li>
    </ul>
   </ol>
   <h3>Conclusion</h3>
   <p>In conclusion, finding a truly scary show as an adult can be a challenge, but it's not impossible. By looking for shows with intense content, branching out into international offerings, and going in blind, we can recapture that thrill of being scared that made us fall in love with horror in the first place.</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Some other tips to remember:</li>
    <ul>
     <li>Don't give up after one or two episodes. Sometimes, shows take a little while to build up to the scary moments.</li>
     <li>Don't be too picky. It's important to remember that not every show is going to scare everyone.</li>
     <li>Go beyond TV shows! There are plenty of scary movies, books, and video games out there to explore as well.</li>
    </ul>
   </ol>
