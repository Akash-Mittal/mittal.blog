  <h1>Striving and Struggle Precede Success</h1></br> <img src="images/Striving-and-Struggle-Precede-Success.jpeg" alt="+Striving-and-Struggle-Precede-Success+"></br>
  <p>Have you ever heard the story of Sarah Ban Breathnach, the author of <i>Simple Abundance</i>? She had hit rock bottom, living in a small garage with her daughter after going through a divorce and bankruptcy. But instead of giving up, she worked hard and eventually became a bestselling author with her book selling millions of copies worldwide. Sarah's story is a reminder that striving and struggle are necessary on the road to success, even in the dictionary.</p>
  <p>Success doesn't come easy, it takes hard work, dedication, and perseverance. There are no shortcuts to success, and the road to achieving your goals can be rocky and full of obstacles. However, it's important to keep going and never give up on your dreams. Every effort counts, and each step you take brings you closer to achieving your objectives.</p>
  <h2>Why Striving and Struggle are Important</h2>
  <p>Striving and struggle are important because they help you grow and learn. When you work hard towards your goals, you develop new skills, gain knowledge, and become more confident. Struggle also teaches you resilience and how to bounce back after facing setbacks and failures.</p>
  <p>Without striving and struggle, life would be uneventful and predictable, and you wouldn't have any opportunities to challenge yourself, take risks, and push your boundaries. When you overcome obstacles and achieve your goals, you feel a sense of accomplishment and pride that can boost your self-esteem and motivation.</p>

  </ul>
