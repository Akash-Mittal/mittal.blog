  <h1>The Gift of Continued Healthcare: Staying on Your Family Health Plan After Graduation</h1></br> <img src="images/The-Gift-of-Continued-Healthcare-Staying-on-Your-Family-Health-Plan-After-Graduation.jpeg" alt="+The-Gift-of-Continued-Healthcare-Staying-on-Your-Family-Health-Plan-After-Graduation+"></br>
  <p>Recently, a young woman named Sarah graduated from college with a degree in journalism. She had high hopes of landing a job in her field, but the pandemic had other plans. Despite her hard work and dedication, Sarah found herself unemployed and on the verge of losing healthcare coverage. That was until she found out about a provision in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that allowed her to stay on her family's health plan until she turned 26, regardless of her employment status.</p>
  <p>This provision, commonly known as the young adult or dependent coverage provision, has been a lifeline for thousands of young people like Sarah. Before it was implemented, many young adults in the US were unable to access affordable healthcare coverage once they graduated from college or turned 18. This left them vulnerable to medical debt, untreated illnesses, and a host of other healthcare-related issues.</p>
  <h2>The Story of Jacob Lew</h2>
  <p>The young adult provision was one of the many provisions of the ACA that was championed by Jacob Lew, former Secretary of the Treasury under President Barack Obama. Lew, a graduate of Harvard and Georgetown Law, was no stranger to the struggles facing young adults when it came to accessing healthcare. In his years as a public servant, he saw firsthand the devastating effects of a lack of healthcare coverage on young people.</p>
  <p>When the ACA was being drafted, Lew made it a priority to include a provision that would allow young adults to stay on their parents' healthcare plan, regardless of their employment status. He knew that this would be a game-changer for many young people who were struggling to make ends meet, and he was right.</p>
  <h2>The Benefits of the Young Adult Provision</h2>
  <p>Since the young adult provision was implemented in 2010, it has provided healthcare coverage to millions of young adults across the country. Here are some of the benefits of the provision:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Young adults can stay on their parents' healthcare plan until they turn 26, regardless of their employment status.</li>
   <li>They have access to the same benefits and protections that other members of the plan have, such as preventive services at no out-of-pocket cost.</li>
   <li>They can choose to stay on their parents' plan even if they are eligible for coverage through their employer.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The young adult provision has been especially beneficial for young adults who are just starting out in their careers. Many entry-level jobs do not offer healthcare coverage, and even those that do may be unaffordable for young adults who are just starting out. By allowing young adults to stay on their parents' plan, the provision ensures that they have access to healthcare coverage while they build their careers.</p>
  <h2>Examples of How the Provision Has Helped</h2>
  <p>The young adult provision has helped countless young people access affordable healthcare coverage. Here are just a few examples:</p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>"Without the young adult provision, I would have been uninsured for several years after college. I was struggling to find a job in my field, and I couldn't afford to pay for my own healthcare coverage. Thanks to the provision, I was able to stay on my parents' plan until I found a job with benefits." - Jen, age 29</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
   <p>"The young adult provision allowed me to concentrate on building my business without worrying about healthcare coverage. As a freelancer, I didn't have access to employer-sponsored coverage, and buying coverage on the marketplace was too expensive. Thanks to the provision, I was able to stay on my parents' plan until my business was profitable enough to offer coverage to my employees." - Tom, age 31</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>The Future of the Young Adult Provision</h2>
  <p>The young adult provision has been a game-changer for millions of young people, but its future is uncertain. Some politicians have proposed repealing or weakening the provision, which could leave millions of young adults without healthcare coverage. It's up to all of us to make sure that the provision remains in place and that young adults continue to have access to affordable healthcare coverage.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The young adult provision has been a gift to millions of young people across the country. By allowing young adults to stay on their parents' healthcare plan, regardless of their employment status, the provision has ensured that they have access to affordable healthcare coverage while they build their careers. Its future is uncertain, but we must do our part to defend and strengthen the provision so that young adults continue to have access to healthcare coverage.</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Stay informed about efforts to repeal or weaken the young adult provision.</li>
   <li>Contact your elected representatives and let them know that you support the provision and want it to remain in place.</li>
   <li>Encourage young adults in your life to take advantage of the provision and stay on their parents' healthcare plan until they turn 26.</li>
