    <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
    <p>When Lance Loud first came out as gay in the early 1970s, he faced discrimination and bigotry from many people in his life. However, he refused to let that deter him from living his life authentically and proudly. As a writer, musician, and reality television star, Lance used his platform to advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and challenge societal norms.</p>
    <p>One aspect of Lance's identity that he embraced was his fashion sense. He often wore bold and unconventional clothing, including platform shoes, statement jackets, and makeup. Lance's style embodied the idea that fashion is a form of self-expression and can be used to challenge gender norms and expectations.</p>

    <h2>The Gay Uniform</h2>
    <blockquote>
     If there is a gay uniform, the differences are in how each man coordinates the details: the brand and cut of the jeans, the design of belts and boots, the haircut, the number and size of earrings. - Paul Rudnick
    </blockquote>
    <p>The quote above from playwright Paul Rudnick captures the idea that there is a certain aesthetic associated with gay culture. While it may not be a prescribed uniform, there are certain fashion choices that are commonly found within the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
    <p>For example, many gay men may opt for slimmer-fitting clothing, such as skinny jeans or tailored suits. Accessorizing is also a popular way to add flair to an outfit, with items like scarves, bracelets, and fedoras being common choices. As with any fashion trends, the specifics of what constitutes the "gay uniform" may vary depending on location, age group, and personal taste.</p>

     <li><strong>Drag Queens:</strong> Drag queens are known for their flamboyant and over-the-top fashion choices.
