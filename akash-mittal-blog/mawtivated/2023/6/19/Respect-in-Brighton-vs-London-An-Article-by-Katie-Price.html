   <h2>An Article by Katie Price</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>When I was a teenager, I used to love going out in Brighton. The clubs, the beach, the pier – it was all so exciting. But now, as a 43-year-old woman, I hate it. I hate the way people look at me. I hate the way they treat me. I hate the lack of respect.</p>
   <h2>It's Different in London</h2>
   <p>When I go out in London, it's a different story altogether. People respect me more there. They don't stare at me like I'm some kind of freak. They don't whisper behind my back. They treat me like a human being.</p>
   <p>This isn't just about me, though. It's about a broader trend that I've noticed. In Brighton, there's a sort of culture of disrespect. People bump into you without apologizing. They push past you without saying excuse me. They don't hold the door open for you.</p>
   <p>In London, it's different. People are more courteous. They say please and thank you. They hold the door open for you. They acknowledge your presence.</p>
   <h2>Why Is This?</h2>
   <p>I don't know exactly why there's such a difference between Brighton and London. Perhaps it's because London is a bigger city, and people are more used to diversity. Perhaps it's because there's more money in London, and people are more likely to respect those who have it.</p>
   <p>Or perhaps it's just a matter of culture. London has a long tradition of politeness and civility. Brighton, on the other hand, has always been a sort of rebel city – a place where people go to break the rules.</p>
   <blockquote>
    "When we treat people merely as they are, they will remain as they are. When we treat them as if they were what they should be, they will become what they should be."
   </blockquote>
   <p>This quote by Thomas S. Monson resonates with me because I believe that if we want people to be respectful, we have to treat them with respect. If we want people to be kind, we have to be kind to them. It's a simple but powerful idea.</p>
   <h2>How Can We Change This?</h2>
   <p>The first step, I think, is to acknowledge that there's a problem. We can't change anything if we don't recognize that it needs changing. Once we've done that, we can start to take action.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Be the change you want to see. If you want people to be respectful, be respectful to them. Lead by example.</li>
    <li>Speak up when you see someone being disrespectful. Sometimes people don't even realize what they're doing, and a gentle reminder can go a long way.</li>
    <li>Support initiatives that promote respect and civility. Whether it's an anti-bullying campaign or a community clean-up project, getting involved can make a difference.</li>
   </ul>
