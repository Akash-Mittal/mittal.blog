   <p>Henry Ward Beecher was an American preacher, social reformer, and abolitionist in the 19th century. He once said, "It is one of the severest tests of friendship to tell your friend his faults. So to love a man that you cannot bear to see a stain upon him, and to speak painful truth through loving words, that is friendship."</p>
   <p>True friendship is not only about hanging out with someone or sharing happy moments. It's also about facing difficult situations together, and sometimes that includes telling your friend the truth, even when it's not easy.</p>

   <h2>Friends Don't Let Friends Drive Drunk</h2>
   <p>One of the most famous public service announcements in the United States was the "Friends Don't Let Friends Drive Drunk" campaign, which ran for several years beginning in the late 1980s. The message was a simple one - if you see your friend trying to drive under the influence of alcohol, it's your responsibility to stop them. You have to take away their keys, offer them a ride home, or call a taxi.</p>
   <p>During this campaign, many lives were saved because friends were willing to step up and tell their buddies the truth. They were willing to risk a potential argument or hurt feelings in order to prevent something much worse from happening.</p>
   <p>This is just one example of how true friendship requires honesty and courage, even in the face of difficult situations.</p>
