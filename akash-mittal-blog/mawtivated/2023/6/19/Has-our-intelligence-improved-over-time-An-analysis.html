  <h1>Has our intelligence improved over time? - An analysis</h1></br> <img src="images/Has-our-intelligence-improved-over-time-An-analysis.jpeg" alt="+Has-our-intelligence-improved-over-time-An-analysis+"></br><!-- Inspiring Story -->
  <p>Imagine you are living in the 18th century, without any means of communication, no internet, and no electricity. And then, in a moment of epiphany, you come up with an invention that revolutionizes the way the world works. That is exactly what James Watt did when he invented the steam engine, which led to the Industrial Revolution.</p><!-- Background of James Lovelock -->
  <p>Another example of human ingenuity is the story of James Lovelock, a British scientist who came up with a theory that proposed the existence of a self-regulating mechanism, which he called Gaia. This theory challenged the prevailing view that the earth was simply a collection of inanimate objects and suggested that it had the ability to regulate its own climate and environment.</p><!-- Evidence of our intelligence -->
  <p>However, despite such examples of human ingenuity and intelligence, there is little evidence that our individual intelligence has improved through recorded history.</p><!-- Examples -->
  <p>Take, for instance, the fact that the average IQ score has remained fairly constant over the past several decades.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>According to a study conducted by James Flynn, the average IQ score in the US has increased by about 3 points every decade from the 1930s to the 1980s. However, this trend has now leveled off and we haven't seen any significant increases in the past few decades.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Moreover, while advances in technology and access to education have made us more informed and knowledgeable, they have not necessarily made us more intelligent. There is a difference between being informed and being intelligent. Intelligence is the ability to analyze and process information, evaluate the various options, and make decisions that are sound and appropriate.</p><!--  or Case Studies -->
  <p>I once knew a person who was very well-read and knew a lot about a lot of things. However, when it came to making decisions, this person often made poor choices. They would get overwhelmed by all the information they had collected and unable to process it effectively, leading to bad decisions.</p><!-- Conclusion -->
  <ol>
   <li>While we may have become more knowledgeable and informed, our individual intelligence hasn't necessarily improved over time.</li>
   <li>In order to become more intelligent, we need to focus on developing our cognitive abilities, such as our ability to analyze and process information, solve problems, and make effective decisions.</li>
   <li>Practical tips for improving our intelligence include regularly engaging in mental exercises, such as puzzles and brain teasers, and seeking out new experiences and challenges that will push us out of our comfort zones.</li>
