  <h2>Author Background</h2>
  <p>Robert Louis Stevenson was born in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1850. He was a sickly child who suffered from lung problems, which made it difficult for him to breathe. Despite this, he was an avid reader and writer from an early age. He attended Edinburgh University, where he studied engineering, but he soon realized that his true passion was in writing. Stevenson went on to become one of the most beloved authors of his time, and his works, such as "Treasure Island," "Kidnapped," and "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," are still popular today.</p>
