  <p>There is a lot to be said for trust in the workplace. Trusting your team members, trusting your boss, trusting your instincts can all lead to greater success and personal fulfillment in your work life. And yet, when it comes to trusting your director on a film set, it takes on a whole new meaning. This is something that actor Ewan McGregor has recently spoken out about, and his thoughts on the matter are insightful and inspiring.</p>
  <h2>Ewan McGregor's Story</h2>

  <blockquote>
   <p>"I think it's really important to trust your director. They are the person who has the vision, who has written the script, who knows how they want the film to look. It's not my job to try and alter that. My job is to give myself over to them and give them everything I have."</p>
