    <h3>An Inspiring Story</h3>
    <p>It was a warm summer day when Alicia, a shy and introverted 10-year-old, stepped up to the microphone in front of a crowded auditorium. She took a deep breath and recited her favorite poem, "I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud" by William Wordsworth. As she spoke the words, she let go of her inhibitions and was transported to a place of beauty and wonder. When she finished, the audience erupted in applause, and for the first time, Alicia felt like she had found her voice.</p>

    <h3>Why Poetry Matters</h3>
    <p>As former U.S. Poet Laureate Rita Dove once said, "Poetry is language at its most distilled and most powerful." It allows us to connect with our emotions, express our thoughts and ideas, and explore the complexities of the world around us. Poetry is not just about rhyming words or pretty phrases; it's a way of thinking and seeing the world that can enrich our lives in countless ways.</p>
    <p>Yet, despite its many benefits, poetry is often marginalized in early education curriculums. Too often, students are taught that poetry is something difficult or unimportant, leading to a lack of interest and engagement with the art form. This is a missed opportunity not only for the students themselves, but for the broader community as well.</p>
    <p>Instead of viewing poetry as a luxury, we should recognize its potential to help children develop important language and literacy skills. By exposing students to poetry early on, we can foster creativity, critical thinking, and a deeper appreciation for language and literature.</p>

    <h3>Incorporating Poetry into the Curriculum</h3>
    <p>So how can we make poetry a more integral part of early education curriculums? Here are a few ideas:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Encourage teachers to incorporate poems into daily activities, such as morning meetings and story time.</li>
     <li>Include poetry units in language arts class, giving students the opportunity to read and write their own poems.</li>
     <li>Host poetry slams or open mic events where students can showcase their skills and engage with the broader community.</li>
     <li>Collaborate with local poets and writers to bring poetry into the classroom and offer workshops and mentoring opportunities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By making poetry a more visible and accessible part of early education, we can help students develop a lifelong love of language and the arts.</p>
