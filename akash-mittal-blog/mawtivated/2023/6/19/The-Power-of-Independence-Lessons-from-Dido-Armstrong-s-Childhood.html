   <p>When Dido Armstrong was a child, she didn't have a television. But instead of feeling deprived, she felt empowered. Without the constant distraction of screens, she was forced to use her imagination and find her own entertainment. She came to appreciate the freedom and independence her parents had given her, and that self-sufficiency has served her well throughout her life.</p>
   <h2>The Benefits of Independence</h2>
   <p>Dido's experience illustrates the power of independence. Here are some of the benefits:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Enhanced creativity:</strong> When you're not constantly consuming media, you have more mental space to be imaginative. Dido's lack of a TV led her to develop a rich inner world and become an accomplished musician and songwriter.</li>
    <li><strong>Greater self-reliance:</strong> When you're able to take care of yourself, you're less likely to be helpless in difficult situations. Dido's childhood taught her how to solve problems on her own and be self-sufficient, which helped her greatly when she launched her music career.</li>
    <li><strong>Increased resilience:</strong> When you face challenges and have to figure things out on your own, it builds character and resilience. Dido's childhood taught her how to be adaptable and overcome obstacles, which has helped her weather the ups and downs of fame.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Practical Tips for Fostering Independence</h2>
   <p>If you want to cultivate more independence in yourself or your children, here are some tips:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Less screen time:</strong> Limit your consumption of television, social media, and other screen-based activities in favor of more active pursuits.</li>
    <li><strong>Encourage problem-solving:</strong> Instead of always providing the answers, encourage your children to think for themselves and find solutions on their own.</li>
    <li><strong>Model independence:</strong> By showing your children that you're capable and self-sufficient, you help them see that it's possible and desirable to be the same way.</li>
   </ul>
