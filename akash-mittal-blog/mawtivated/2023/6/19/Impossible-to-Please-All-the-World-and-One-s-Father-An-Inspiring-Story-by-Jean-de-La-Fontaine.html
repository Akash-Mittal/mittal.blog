   <p>Once upon a time, Jean de La Fontaine â€“ the famous French fabulist, was born to a wealthy family. His father wanted him to become a lawyer or a politician but he had a passion for writing. As a result, Jean had to fight hard to follow his own career path. He faced a lot of criticism and rejection from his father, peers, and society in general. But he persevered and eventually became one of the most celebrated writers in French history.</p>
   <p>In one of his fables, he wrote, "It is impossible to please all the world and one's father." This statement holds true even today. It is a fact of life that no matter what we do, we cannot please everyone around us. If we try too hard to please everyone, we may end up losing ourselves in the process.</p>
   
   <ul>
    <li>When I was in college, I used to try very hard to fit in with the popular crowd. But no matter what I did, I always felt like I was on the outside looking in. It was only when I stopped trying to please others and started being true to myself that I was able to make real friends who accepted me for who I am.</li>
    <li>My friend recently got a promotion at work, but her father was disappointed that she didn't become a doctor like he always wanted. She was devastated at first, but then she realized that it was her life and she had to make her own choices.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Examples</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>A famous chef who creates unique and exotic dishes may have many admirers, but there will always be some critics who dislike his cuisine.</li>
    <li>A politician who takes a stand on a controversial issue will have supporters and detractors depending on their political beliefs.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>It is impossible to please all the world and one's father, but we can still live fulfilling lives by being true to ourselves. Here are three practical tips:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Be clear about your values and beliefs, and make decisions based on what feels right to you.</li>
    <li>Surround yourself with people who support and encourage you, rather than trying to win over those who don't.</li>
    <li>Don't be afraid to take risks and pursue your dreams, even if it means going against popular opinion.</li>
   </ul>
