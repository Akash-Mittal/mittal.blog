   <p>Once upon a time, there was a man named Jack who had everything he could ask for in life. He had a big house, a fancy car, a loving family, and a successful career. But one day, he woke up feeling lost and empty. He realized that he had been focusing so much on the light in his life that he had neglected his darker side.</p>
   <p>Jack's story might seem like a cautionary tale, but it serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of balance in life. As humans, we need both light and shade to thrive. In the words of Imelda Staunton, "A lot of me is very up, and you have to have light and shade. They are both important and you have to be able to balance them."</p>
