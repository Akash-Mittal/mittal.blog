  <blockquote>
   "There is no friend as loyal as a book." - Ernest Hemingway
  </blockquote>
  <p>Let me start this article with a story. You might have heard about the mass shooting that happened at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival in Las Vegas in 2017. A friend of mine was there enjoying the music with a group of people, including his girlfriend. When the shooting started, they all ran in different directions. My friend ended up under a table, terrified for his life.</p>
  <p>After the shooting ended, he got out from under the table only to find that his girlfriend was missing. He searched everywhere, but couldn't find her. The panic was unbearable. He didn't know whether she was alive or dead. He called her phone, but it went straight to voicemail. Finally, after hours of waiting and worrying, he got a call from her. She was safe, but had been hiding behind a food truck with a group of strangers.</p>
  <p>This story is just one of many that illustrate the violence that permeates American culture. We live in a society that lionizes guns, glorifies war, and revels in revenge. We watch movies and TV shows that are full of violence, play video games that simulate killing, and consume news that bombards us with images of death and destruction.</p>
  <h2>Author - Katherine Dunn Story or Background</h2>
  <p>Katherine Dunn was a writer and journalist who was known for her offbeat novels and articles. She was born in 1945 and grew up in an unconventional family in Portland, Oregon. Her father was a boxer and her mother was a waitress, and they were both part of a traveling carnival. Dunn started her career as a journalist, writing for alternative newspapers in the 1960s and 1970s. Her first novel, <em>Attic</em>, was published in 1970, but it wasn't until 1989 that she gained national attention with her novel <em>Geek Love</em>. The book was a critical and commercial success, and was a finalist for the National Book Award. Dunn died in 2016 at the age of 70.</p>
  <h2>American Culture: A Love-Hate Relationship with Violence</h2>
  <p>American culture is torn between our long romance with violence and our terror of the devastation wrought by war and crime and environmental havoc. On the one hand, violence has always been part of our national mythology. We see ourselves as rugged individualists who have triumphed over adversity through force of will and the barrel of a gun. We celebrate the cowboys and outlaws who tamed the Wild West, and we idolize the soldiers who fought and died in wars from the American Revolution to the present day.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, we are all too aware of the cost of violence. We know that wars and crime and environmental destruction have left millions dead, injured, or displaced. We recognize that violence begets violence, and that revenge is a never-ending cycle. And we feel the personal toll of violence in our own lives, whether it's from domestic abuse, sexual assault, or street crime.</p>
