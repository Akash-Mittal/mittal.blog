  <p>Growing up, music stores were a haven for those who loved music. Entering one would be like entering a treasure trove of vinyl records, cassette tapes, and CDs. However, with the rise of digital music and the advent of DJing, the purpose of music stores has evolved. In this article, we take a look at the evolution of music stores and how they adapted to changing times.</p>
  <h2>Jam Master Jay: Pioneer of Modern Music Stores</h2>
  <p>Jam Master Jay, born Jason Mizell, was a renowned DJ and member of the hip-hop group Run-DMC. In the 90s, he opened up a music store in Queens, New York, called Scratch DJ Academy, which quickly became the go-to place for those interested in DJing. This store was unique in that it wasn't just about selling records, but also about teaching aspiring DJs the craft.</p>
