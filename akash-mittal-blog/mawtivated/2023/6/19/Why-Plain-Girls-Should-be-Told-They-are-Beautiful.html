   <p>Once upon a time, there was a plain girl named Lily. She had never thought of herself as beautiful because no one had ever told her so. Her mother always said she was so plain that she would never find a good husband. Her classmates at school teased her for her frizzy hair and big nose. Lily had never felt confident or worthy of attention.</p>
   <p>One day, a new boy joined her class. His name was Jake, and he had the kindest smile Lily had ever seen. When he sat next to her, he said, "Hi, I'm Jake. You have really pretty eyes." Lily was so surprised that she blushed and stuttered a thank you. From that day on, Jake made a point of complimenting Lily every day. He said her smile was contagious, her voice was soothing, and her laugh was charming. Lily couldn't believe that anyone could see good things in her.</p>
   <p>With Jake's words ringing in her ears, Lily started to see herself in a new light. She began to take care of her appearance and experiment with makeup. She joined a drama club and discovered she had a talent for acting. She made new friends who liked her for who she was, not for her looks. Lily realized that being beautiful was not the same as being perfect. Being beautiful was about being confident, kind, and comfortable in your own skin. Thanks to Jake, Lily became a beautiful girl.</p>
   <h2>The Power of Words</h2>
   <p>Lily's story is not a unique one. Many plain girls grow up with low self-esteem and lack of confidence because of harsh criticism, neglect, or bullying. They feel invisible or unwanted, and this affects their relationships, their career choices, and their mental health. However, the good news is that a simple word of appreciation or encouragement can work wonders for a plain girl's self-image. As actress Hedy Lamarr once said, "Plain girls should have someone telling them they are beautiful. Sometimes this works miracles."</p>
   <blockquote>
    "My mother always called me an ugly weed, so I never was aware of anything until I was older."
   </blockquote>
   <p>Hedy Lamarr's story is worth telling. She was a Hollywood starlet who also had a gift for science. She co-invented a technology that would later on lead to the development of Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, and other wireless communication systems. However, during her career, Lamarr was often dismissed as a pretty face and underestimated for her intellect. She once said that she regretted not being taken seriously because of her looks.</p>
   <p>Lamarr's words speak to the importance of acknowledging and nurturing a plain girl's potential, not just her appearance. When someone tells a plain girl that she is beautiful, they are not just commenting on her physical traits, but on her whole being. They are recognizing her uniqueness, her worth, and her potential to shine. They are also giving her a boost of self-love and self-respect that can influence her choices, her relationships, and her impact on the world.</p>
   <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
   <p>If you know a plain girl who could use a word of encouragement, here are some practical tips to give her the boost she needs:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Compliment her on something she said, did, or accomplished, not just on her looks.</li>
    <li>Express your appreciation for her presence, her humor, her kindness, or her intelligence.</li>
    <li>Encourage her to pursue her passions, whether they involve art, sports, science, or anything else.</li>
    <li>Offer to help her with a project, a task, or a problem, and show her that you believe in her abilities.</li>
    <li>Listen to her when she needs to vent, rant, or share her feelings, and validate her emotions.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Remember that beauty is not just a matter of appearance, but of attitude and character. When you tell a plain girl that she is beautiful, you are not lying or sugarcoating the truth. You are revealing the truth that has been there all along, but hidden by doubts and insecurities. You are giving her the gift of confidence, self-love, and self-expression that can transform her life for the better. So go ahead and tell a plain girl that she is beautiful today, and see what miracles can happen.</p>
