  <h1>The Power of Jogging</h1></br> <img src="images/The-Difference-between-Jogging-and-Running.jpeg" alt="+The-Difference-between-Jogging-and-Running+"></br><!-- Inspiring Story -->
  <p>Running is a tough sport that requires a lot of physical and mental strength. However, the simple act of jogging can also provide immense benefits to our health and well-being. Let me share with you the story of Mary Decker, an American record-holder in women's track and field.</p><!-- Personal Anecdote -->
  <p>Mary Decker started her running career at the age of 15, and soon became a national champion in the United States. She went on to win multiple medals in international competitions and set several world records. However, her success did not come without challenges. In 1984, at the Olympic Games in Los Angeles, Mary was involved in a collision with another runner and could not finish the race.</p><!-- Author Background -->
  <p>After that disappointment, Mary struggled with injuries and had to take a break from running. She turned to jogging as a way to maintain her fitness and gradually recover from her setbacks. She found that jogging allowed her to stay active without putting too much strain on her body. She also enjoyed the freedom and simplicity of jogging, which reminded her of the reasons why she started running in the first place.</p><!-- Importance of Jogging -->
  <p>For Mary, jogging was not just a means to an end, but a way to reconnect with herself and her passion for running. She realized that jogging was not inferior to running, but a different form of it. She could still challenge herself, improve her endurance, and reap the health benefits of exercise. And so can we.</p>
  <h2>The Difference between Jogging and Running</h2><!-- Examples -->
  <p>The difference between jogging and running lies in their intensity and speed. Jogging is generally slower than running, with a pace of 4-6 miles per hour. It involves a continuous, rhythmic movement of the legs and arms, and can be done for extended periods of time. Running, on the other hand, is faster and more demanding, with a pace of 6-12 miles per hour. It requires a more explosive and powerful movement of the legs and arms, and is usually done in shorter bursts.</p><!-- Bullet Points -->
