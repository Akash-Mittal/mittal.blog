    <p class="intro">Inspiration can come in many different forms. It can come from a person, a book, a place, or even a spiritual experience. For many people, religion is a source of inspiration and guidance. However, there are those who view religion as a hindrance rather than a helper. This article will explore the major obstacle to religious renewal and provide practical tips for overcoming it.</p>
    <h2>Robert Bork Story</h2>
    <p>Before we dive in, let's take a look at the story of Robert Bork. Robert Bork was a highly respected judge and legal scholar. He was also a devout Catholic. In his book, Slouching Towards Gomorrah, Bork argues that the decline of religion is leading to the decline of society as a whole. He argues that religion provides a moral framework that is necessary for a healthy society.</p>
    <p>Despite his impressive credentials, Bork was criticized for his religious beliefs. Some of his colleagues saw his religious beliefs as primitive superstition. They believed that science had left atheism as the only respectable intellectual stance. Sadly, Bork's experience is not unique.</p>
    <h2>The Major Obstacle</h2>
    <p>The major obstacle to religious renewal is the intellectual classes. These classes are highly influential and tend to view religion as primitive superstition. They believe that science has left atheism as the only respectable intellectual stance. As a result, many people dismiss religion as antiquated and irrelevant.</p>
    <p>Another problem is that intellectuals tend to look down on religious people. They view religious people as uneducated and unsophisticated. This view is not only unfair but also inaccurate. Many people who are highly educated and sophisticated have a deep faith in their religion.</p>
    <h2>Practical Tips for Overcoming the Obstacle</h2>
    <p>Despite these challenges, it is possible to overcome the obstacle posed by the intellectual classes. Here are some practical tips:</p>
    <ul>
     <li><b>Learn More About Your Faith</b>: Read books and articles about your faith. Attend lectures and classes. The more you know about your faith, the better equipped you will be to defend it.</li>
     <li><b>Share Your Faith with Others</b>: Don't be afraid to share your faith with others. Invite your friends to attend religious services with you. Share inspiring stories and quotes with them.</li>
     <li><b>Engage in Dialogue</b>: Engage in respectful dialogue with those who hold different viewpoints. Ask questions and listen to their answers. You may find that you have more in common than you thought.</li>
     <li><b>Live Out Your Faith</b>: Finally, live out your faith. Let your actions speak louder than your words. Be kind, compassionate, and loving. Your example may be the thing that inspires others to reconsider their views on religion.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, the intellectual classes are a major obstacle to religious renewal. However, with the right approach, it is possible to overcome this obstacle. By learning more about your faith, sharing it with others, engaging in dialogue, and living it out, you can help to create a world where religion is respected and valued.</p>
