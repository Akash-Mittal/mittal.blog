    <h2>Alfred Adler: A Pioneer in the Science of the Mind</h2>
    <p>Alfred Adler was a renowned psychotherapist who developed the theory of individual psychology. He believed that our behavior is guided by our perceptions and beliefs, and that we are driven by a desire for personal growth and social connections. Adler's work laid the foundation for many modern theories of personality and motivation.</p>
