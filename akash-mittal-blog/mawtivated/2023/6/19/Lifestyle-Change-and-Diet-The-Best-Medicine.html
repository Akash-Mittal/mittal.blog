    <h2>A Real Life Story</h2>
    <p>When I first met John, he weighed in at over 350 pounds. He had high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and was on the verge of developing diabetes. He was also deeply unhappy with his life and struggling with depression. He felt trapped and didn't know how to escape his misery.</p>
    <p>But John was open to change. He was tired of feeling sick and tired, and was willing to do whatever it took to regain his health and happiness. We started by working on his diet, cutting out processed foods and sugary drinks and focusing on whole, nutrient-dense foods. We also incorporated exercise slowly, starting with simple walks and working up to more intense workouts. And we worked on his mindset, emphasizing self-care and self-compassion.</p>
    <p>Over time, John transformed. He lost over 150 pounds, got off all his medications, and reversed his high blood pressure and high cholesterol. He reported feeling happier and more fulfilled than ever before, with a newfound zest for life. His transformation was remarkable, but it wasn't a miracle. It was the power of lifestyle change and diet.</p>

    <h2>Who is Mark Hyman?</h2><img src="https://www.onegreenplanet.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MarkHyman.jpg" alt="Mark Hyman photo">
    <p>Mark Hyman, MD, is a functional medicine physician and founder and director of The UltraWellness Center in Lenox, Massachusetts. He has written several New York Times bestsellers, including <em>The Blood Sugar Solution</em> and <em>The UltraMind Solution</em>. His approach emphasizes the power of food and lifestyle to heal chronic disease.</p>

    <h2>Why Lifestyle Change and Diet?&gt;/h2&gt; <p>The evidence is clear: lifestyle change and changes in diet work faster, better and more cheaply than any medication and are as effective or more effective than gastric bypass without any side effects or long-term complications.</p>
     <blockquote>
      "Food is not just calories, it is information. It talks to your DNA and tells it what to do. The most powerful tool to change your health, environment and entire world is your fork." - Dr. Mark Hyman
     </blockquote><p>In other words, what we eat matters. It's not just about the calories we consume, but the information those calories send to our bodies. Whole, nutrient-dense foods send messages of health and vitality, while processed, inflammatory foods send messages of disease and distress. And when we focus on lifestyle change, we address the root cause of chronic disease, rather than just treating the symptoms.</p></h2>
