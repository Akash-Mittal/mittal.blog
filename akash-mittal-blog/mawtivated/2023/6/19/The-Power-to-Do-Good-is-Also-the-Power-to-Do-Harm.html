    <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
    <p>It was a busy day at the hospital when a new nurse was hired. Despite being new, she was eager to help and make an impact. She was tasked to administer medications to patients in different rooms. However, instead of following the proper procedures, she acted on her own and gave the wrong medicine to a patient, causing a severe allergic reaction. It was a mistake that not only harmed the patient, but also the nurse as she faced charges. This story highlights the power of doing good and the consequences of not following proper procedures.</p>

    <h2>The Power to Do Good and Harm</h2>
    <p>The power to do good is something that we all possess. It's the ability to make a positive impact on the world, no matter how small. It could be as simple as volunteering at a local shelter or donating to a charity. But with that power comes the power to do harm. It could be through neglect, indifference, or even intentional action.</p>
    <p>The best example of this is the world of business. Companies have the power to do a lot of good – they can create jobs, improve the economy, and contribute to society. But they also have the power to harm – they can exploit workers, damage the environment, and engage in unethical practices. It's up to business leaders and society to ensure that companies use their power for good and not for harm.</p>
    <p>It's important to recognize that the power to do good is also the power to do harm. We must always aim to do the former, while avoiding the latter.</p>

    <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
    <p>As a business leader and economist, I've seen firsthand the power of doing good and harm. One example is the minimum wage. Many argue that raising the minimum wage would be an act of good, as it would improve the lives of those who rely on it. However, I believe that it would actually do more harm than good. It would lead to higher unemployment, as companies would be forced to cut jobs to afford the higher wages.</p>
    <p>Another example is the role of government. While it may seem like the government always has the power to do good, it can also do harm when it overreaches. Take the example of rent control. While it may seem like a good idea to limit the rent that landlords can charge, it often leads to a shortage of affordable housing. Landlords have less incentive to maintain their properties, leading to a decline in the quality of housing.</p>
    <p>These examples highlight the need to carefully consider the consequences of our actions. We must aim to do good, but we must also avoid doing harm.</p>
