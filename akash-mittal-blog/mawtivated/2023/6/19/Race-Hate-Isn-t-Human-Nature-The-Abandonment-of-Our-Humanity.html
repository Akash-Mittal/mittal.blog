  <h1>Race Hate Isn't Human Nature: The Abandonment of Our Humanity</h1></br> <img src="images/Race-Hate-Isn-t-Human-Nature-The-Abandonment-of-Our-Humanity.jpeg" alt="+Race-Hate-Isn-t-Human-Nature-The-Abandonment-of-Our-Humanity+"></br>
  <p>There was once a man named Tyler who lived in a small town in the southern United States. He grew up believing that people of certain races were inferior and should be treated as such. It wasn't until he met a woman named Sophia who challenged his beliefs that he began to question everything he had been taught. Sophia was a kind and intelligent person, despite being of a different race, and Tyler realized that his hatred had been misplaced.</p>
  <p>This may sound like a cliche story, but it's one that has been repeated countless times throughout history. The fact is that race hate is not a natural part of our human nature. It is a learned behavior, one that is often passed down from generation to generation. But just because something is learned doesn't mean it can't be unlearned.</p>
  <h2>Orson Welles Story</h2>
  <p>Orson Welles, the famous actor and filmmaker, once said, "Race hate isn't human nature; race hate is the abandonment of human nature." In other words, we aren't naturally disposed to hate people of different races. It's only when we let go of our humanity that we become capable of such hatred.</p>
  <p>Welles knew all too well the dangers of abandoning our humanity. He was a passionate advocate for civil rights, and his work often reflected his beliefs. One of his most famous films, "Citizen Kane," explores themes of power and corruption, and how they can lead people down a dark path. It's a cautionary tale about the dangers of letting our darker impulses take over.</p>
  <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
  <p>But let's get back to Tyler and Sophia. Their story is just one example of how race hate can be overcome. There are many other similar stories out there, if we only take the time to look for them. For example, there's the story of Daryl Davis, a black musician who has made it his life's work to befriend members of the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist groups. Through his efforts, he has convinced over 200 members to give up their hateful beliefs.</p>
  <p>Then there's the case of Jane Elliott, a teacher who conducted an experiment in her classroom in 1968 to teach her all-white students about the dangers of discrimination. The experiment, called "A Class Divided," involved separating her students into two groups based on eye color, then treating one group as superior to the other. The results were shocking, and showed just how easily people can be swayed by messages of hate and superiority.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, race hate is not a natural part of our human nature. It's a learned behavior, one that can be unlearned. The key is to hold onto our humanity and refuse to let go of it in the face of messages of hate and division. Here are three practical tips for doing just that:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Expose yourself to people of different races, religions, and cultures. The more you understand about different groups, the less likely you are to hate them.</li>
   <li>Challenge your own beliefs regularly. Ask yourself why you believe what you do, and don't be afraid to change your mind if you realize you are wrong.</li>
   <li>Stand up against hate whenever you see it. Don't let hateful speech or behavior go unchallenged, even when it's uncomfortable or inconvenient to do so.</li>
  </ul>

   "We must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools." - Martin Luther King Jr.
  </blockquote>
  <p>Let's all make an effort to hold onto our humanity and embrace our diversity. By doing so, we can build a better world for ourselves and for future generations.</p>
