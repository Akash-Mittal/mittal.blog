  <p>It was a bright sunny day in the suburbs of New York when 13-year-old Emily saw her father for the last time before he left for Afghanistan. As he walked towards the car, his uniform shining under the sun, Emily could feel his confidence and pride in serving his country. Little did she know, that was the last time she would see him. Her father, a brave American soldier, lost his life protecting his fellow citizens. This is just one story that reflects the mission of America - to protect and promote a democratic peace throughout the world.</p>
