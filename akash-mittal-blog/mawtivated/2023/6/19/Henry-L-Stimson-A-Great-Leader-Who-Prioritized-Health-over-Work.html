  <p>In a world where productivity is glorified and overworking is encouraged, it is important to remember that our well-being should always come first. This is a lesson that can be learned from one of the greatest leaders in history, Henry L. Stimson.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Henry L. Stimson was an American statesman, lawyer, and diplomat who served as Secretary of War under Presidents William Howard Taft, Herbert Hoover, and Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was known for his integrity, intelligence, and unwavering dedication to his country. However, there was one thing he valued above all else - his health.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In 1939, while serving as Secretary of State under President Roosevelt, Stimson realized that he needed to prioritize his health over his work. He met with the President and informed him of his doctors' advice that he needed to take a complete rest. Stimson knew that this meant leaving the Department finally in a short time.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Despite being at the peak of his career, Stimson did not hesitate to step down and prioritize his health. This decision was not easy for him, but he knew that it was the best thing for him in the long run.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Stimson's story is a testament to the fact that our health should always come first, no matter how successful and accomplished we may be. Here are some practical tips we can learn from Stimson's example:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Listen to your body</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Stimson was in his 70s when he realized that he needed to prioritize his health. He listened to his body and took his doctors' advice seriously. We should do the same. If we feel tired or run-down, we should take a break and rest.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Prioritize self-care</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Stimson knew that he needed a complete rest to recover. We should prioritize self-care too. This means eating healthily, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, and taking time for ourselves.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Don't be afraid to step back</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Stimson did not hesitate to step down from his position when he realized that he needed to take a break. We should not be afraid to step back from our work or other responsibilities if they are negatively impacting our health.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, Henry L. Stimson was a great leader who prioritized his health over his work. His story serves as a reminder to all of us that our well-being should always come first. Let us learn from his example and prioritize our health too.</p>
