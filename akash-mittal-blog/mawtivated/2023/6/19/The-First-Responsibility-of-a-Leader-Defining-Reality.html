   <p>It was a sunny day when I witnessed an inspiring example of leadership. I was in a small village in Uganda, trying to understand the effects of climate change on local communities. As I approached a group of farmers, I saw a woman standing in front of them, holding a map of the area.</p>
   <p>She introduced herself as the leader of the village and started explaining how the land had changed in the last years, how floods and droughts had affected their crops, and how they were adapting to the new conditions. Her speech was clear and concise, and everyone listened with respect and attention.</p>
   <p>As I talked more with her, I discovered that she had no formal education, no political power, and no wealth. Yet, she was able to lead her community through the challenges of climate change, by defining reality and serving her people.</p>
   <h2>The Leader as a Servant</h2>
   <p>This story reminds me of a quote by Max de Pree, a renowned business executive and author, who said that "the first responsibility of a leader is to define reality. The last is to say thank you. In between, the leader is a servant."</p>
   <p>What does it mean to be a servant leader? It means that the leader puts the needs of others first, and empowers them to reach their full potential. It means that the leader is humble, ethical, and compassionate, and creates a culture of trust and collaboration. It means that the leader is not afraid to take risks, to challenge the status quo, and to inspire others to follow.</p>
   <p>Being a servant leader is not easy, but it is essential in today's complex and uncertain world. Whether you are leading a business, a non-profit organization, a government agency, or a community group, you need to have the courage and wisdom to define reality and serve others.</p>
   <h2>The Leader's Responsibilities</h2>
   <p>What are the leader's responsibilities, according to Max de Pree? Let's break them down:</p>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>Define reality:</strong> The leader must have a clear understanding of the situation, the context, and the challenges facing the organization or the community. This requires gathering data, analyzing trends, listening to stakeholders, and synthesizing insights. The leader must then communicate this reality to the team, in a way that is honest, transparent, and inspiring.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve others:</strong> The leader must put the needs of others first, and empower them to succeed. This requires building trust, providing resources, offering guidance, and recognizing achievements. The leader must also foster a sense of purpose, by articulating a compelling vision, values, and goals that resonate with the team.</li>
    <li><strong>Say thank you:</strong> The leader must express gratitude, appreciation, and recognition to the team, for their contributions and sacrifices. This requires acknowledging everyone's efforts, celebrating milestones, and rewarding results. The leader must also model the behavior that he or she expects from others, by being respectful, fair, and humble.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>Examples of Servant Leadership</h2>
   <p>There are many examples of servant leadership, in different fields and cultures. Here are a few:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><em>Mother Teresa:</em> She devoted her life to serving the poor and the sick, and inspired millions of people around the world with her compassion and humility.</li>
    <li><em>Nelson Mandela:</em> He fought against apartheid and oppression in South Africa, and led his country towards reconciliation and democracy, by forgiveness and inclusiveness.</li>
    <li><em>Howard Schultz:</em> He transformed Starbucks from a small coffee roaster to a global brand, by focusing on quality, sustainability, and social responsibility, and by treating his employees as partners.</li>
    <li><em>Pope Francis:</em> He reformed the Vatican and challenged the Church to be more humble, merciful, and open-minded, by emphasizing the values of love, justice, and peace.</li>
    <li><em>Malala Yousafzai:</em> She stood up for girls' education and human rights in Pakistan, defying the Taliban's threats and violence, and became a global advocate for peace and equality.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>To sum up, being a leader is not about having power, prestige, or wealth. It is about defining reality, serving others, and saying thank you. It is about inspiring, enabling, and empowering people to achieve their full potential, by creating a culture of trust, respect, and collaboration. It is about being a servant, first and foremost, and a leader, secondly.</p>
   <p>Here are three practical tips for becoming a servant leader:</p>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>Listen:</strong> Listen to your team, your customers, your partners, and your stakeholders, with empathy and curiosity. Ask questions, seek feedback, and acknowledge different perspectives. This will help you understand reality better, and build trust and engagement.</li>
    <li><strong>Coach:</strong> Coach your team, by providing guidance, feedback, and support, in a way that is constructive, inspiring, and respectful. Help them develop their skills, their confidence, and their sense of purpose. This will help them grow and succeed, and create a culture of continuous learning.</li>
    <li><strong>Lead by example:</strong> Lead by example, by embodying the values, behaviors, and attitudes that you want to promote in your team. Be honest, fair, and transparent. Take responsibility for your decisions and actions. Celebrate successes and learn from failures. This will help you earn respect and credibility, and inspire others to follow.</li>
   </ol>
