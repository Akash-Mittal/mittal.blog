   <p>Who is Magic Johnson? Most people know him as a basketball legend, a successful entrepreneur, and an HIV/AIDS activist. But do you know him as a son, a father, and a husband?</p>
   <p>Earvin "Magic" Johnson Jr. was born in Lansing, Michigan, in 1959. He was the fourth of seven children in a family of hardworking parents. During his childhood, Magic was just a shy and fat boy who loved basketball and movies. He was not the most talented or the most athletic player, but he had something that set him apart from others: his passion for the game and his positive attitude.</p>
   <p>Magic's parents, Earvin Sr. and Christine, were both factory workers who took pride in their jobs and their children. They instilled in Magic and his siblings the values of hard work, respect, and generosity. They supported their kids' dreams and aspirations, and they encouraged them to pursue education and sports as a way out of poverty and discrimination.</p>
   <blockquote>
    "God blessed me with two unbelievable parents, and I am just like both of them. I have the smile and charisma of my mother and the big heart of my mom, because she wants to save the world and help the world, so I am just like her." - Magic Johnson
   </blockquote>
   <p>Indeed, Magic inherited many of his parents' traits and character. He has been described as a kind, humble, and optimistic person who sees the good in others and himself. He has also been praised for his leadership skills, his business acumen, and his humanitarian efforts.
