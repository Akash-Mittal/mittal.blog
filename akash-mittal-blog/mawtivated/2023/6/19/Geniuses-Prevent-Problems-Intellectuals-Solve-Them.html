   <p>"I have no special talent, I am only passionately curious." - Albert Einstein</p>
   <p>Albert Einstein, one of the most intelligent human beings to ever live once said, "Intellectuals solve problems, geniuses prevent them." This quote still resonates today as we strive to change the world we live in.</p>
   <p>Being an Intellectual is a great quality to have, but being a Genius is fascinating. Here we will go over what makes Intellectuals and Geniuses different, and how you can work on developing Genius-like qualities.</p>
   <h2>Intellectuals vs. Geniuses</h2>
   <p>Intellectuals are known for their problem-solving abilities. They have the capacity to analyze complex issues and come up with efficient solutions. Intellectuals are skilled in critical thinking, and they are always looking for the best outcome in challenging situations.</p>
   <p>Geniuses, on the other hand, approach problems differently. Rather than waiting for a problem to arise, geniuses think ahead of the curve and prevent a problem from occurring in the first place. They have the ability to anticipate issues before they happen, and create preventative measures to avert crises.</p>
   <h2>Examples of Geniuses</h2>
   <p>One of the greatest examples of a Genius is Leonardo Da Vinci. He had a curious mind and tried his hand at various disciples, including painting, engineering, and architecture. He was always looking for ways to improve what was already in existence and to create what didn't exist yet. His most significant work is the painting of the Mona Lisa.</p>
   <p>Another example is Steve Jobs. He created the most innovative products of his time, including the iPod, iPhone, and iPad. He had the vision to think ahead of his competitors to envision new products that the world didn't even know it needed.</p>
   <h2>Developing Your Genius-Like Qualities</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Curiosity:</li>
    <p>Being curious and asking questions is essential to finding creative solutions and thinking beyond the obvious. Curiosity helps fuel creativity and problem-solving mindsets.</p>
    <li>Practice:</li>
    <p>The more you think and engage with your mind, the better it will become. A genius does not happen overnight, but rather through years of dedication and hard work.</p>
    <li>Failures are Learning Opportunities:</li>
    <p>Geniuses understand that failures are a crucial part of the learning process. Failures teach valuable lessons and highlight what doesn't work, which helps you refocus your efforts.</p>
    <li>Collaboration:</li>
    <p>Collaboration fosters innovation and helps to bring new ideas to the table. A successful genius is aware and understands that collaboration increases creativity, knowledge and brings diversity of perspectives.</p>
    <li>Think Outside the Box;</li>
    <p>Geniuses think beyond what is in front of them. They take a step out of their comfort zone into the unknown that pushes them to new boundaries of creative possibilities.</p>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Think like a Genius:</li>
    <p>Think ahead of the curve and anticipate issues before they happen. Use your creative intuition to find new solutions and avoid unnecessary hardships.</p>
    <li>Fail Forward:</li>
    <p>Believe in yourself and celebrate your failures in finding solutions. Recognize them as a natural part of the learning process.</p>
    <li>Collaborate Efficiently:</li>
    <p>Collaborate with people who share your passion for innovation to build a diverse network pool. By using each other's skills and knowledge, in an informed context, you'll understand the essence of your collaborative strengths.</p>
   </ol>
