  <p>There was once a young girl named Anna. She lived in a small village in Africa with no access to clean water. She had to trek miles every day just to fetch water for drinking, cooking, and cleaning. But one day, a group of scientists came to their village and installed a water filtration system. This system changed Anna's life forever. She no longer had to spend hours fetching water every day. She was able to go to school and have a brighter future. This is the power of science.</p><!-- Background of Francis Bacon -->
