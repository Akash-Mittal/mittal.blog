   <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
   <p>Corey Feldman is a well-known name in Hollywood who rose to fame at a very young age. He started his acting career at the age of 3 and became famous before he even knew his own name. His talent was recognized by many and he soon began landing prominent roles in movies and TV shows.</p>
   <p>However, fame at such a young age came with a high price. Corey was exposed to the darker side of Hollywood, including drug abuse and sexual exploitation. He struggled to cope with the pressure of fame and the constant scrutiny of his personal life.</p>
   <h2>Corey Feldman's Story</h2>
   <p>Corey Feldman was born on July 16, 1971, in Los Angeles, California. His parents were both in the entertainment industry, and his mother managed his early career. He made his film debut in the 1980 comedy "The Fox and the Hound" and soon after landed a prominent role in the classic film "Stand By Me."</p>
   <p>Corey's career continued to thrive throughout the 1980s, with notable roles in films such as "The Lost Boys," "License to Drive" and "Dream a Little Dream." However, his childhood was far from perfect. He was exposed to drugs and alcohol at a very young age, and he had to deal with the pressure of being a child star.</p>
   <p>In his book "Coreyography," Corey recounts the sexual abuse he and his friend and fellow child star Corey Haim endured in the industry. Corey alleges that they were targeted by several powerful industry figures, and that their abusers were protected by powerful lawyers and agents.</p>
