   <p>Once upon a time, there was a young boy living in a small village. He was known for his kind heart and helpful nature. Every day, he would wake up early to help his parents with chores and then go out to assist his neighbours. He was always happy and content, and people loved him for his generosity and compassion.</p>
   <p>One day, the boy's father fell ill. The family was poor and could not afford to pay for his treatment. The boy saw his mother crying and decided that he would do anything to help them. He went to the nearby city and started working as a labourer. Even though the work was hard and exhausting, he never complained and always gave his best.</p>
   <p>One day, a rich man passing by saw him working and was impressed by his determination and work ethic. He offered him a job as his assistant, which the boy accepted. He worked hard and learnt a lot from the rich man, who became his mentor and friend.</p>
   <p>Years went by, and the boy grew up to become a successful businessman. He was wealthy and respected, but he never forgot his roots. He started a charity to help poor families like his, and he would often visit his old village to meet his friends and family. He was always happy and content, and people loved him for his goodness and kindness.</p>
   <p>This boy was Maurice Maeterlinck, a Belgian playwright, poet, and essayist. He believed that goodness was the key to happiness, and that helping others was the most fulfilling experience one could have. He once said,</p>
   <blockquote>
    "An act of goodness is of itself an act of happiness. No reward coming after the event can compare with the sweet reward that went with it."
   </blockquote>
   <p>Maeterlinck's philosophy was simple yet profound. He believed that kindness and compassion were the true sources of happiness and that material possessions and fame were temporary and superficial.</p>
   
   <p>Throughout my life, I have come across many people who embody the qualities that Maeterlinck valued. One such person is my grandmother. She is one of the kindest and most compassionate people I know, and she always puts others before herself. Even in her old age, she still volunteers at a local charity and helps out her neighbours. She finds happiness in making others happy, and her generosity has inspired many people, including me.</p>
   <p>Another example is a friend of mine who started a non-profit organisation to help underprivileged children in his city. He was deeply affected by the poverty and lack of education that he saw around him, and he decided to do something about it. He now spends most of his time and resources on this cause, and he feels a sense of fulfilment and purpose that he never thought possible.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>Based on Maeterlinck's philosophy and the examples I have seen, I believe that goodness and happiness are deeply connected. Here are three key points to keep in mind:</p>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>Kindness and compassion:</strong> These are the qualities that define us as human beings. When we help others and show empathy, we feel a sense of connection and purpose.</li>
    <li><strong>Material possessions:</strong> While they may bring temporary pleasure, they are not the source of lasting happiness. True happiness comes from within and depends on our attitude towards life.</li>
    <li><strong>The power of giving:</strong> Helping others not only benefits them but also brings joy and fulfilment to our own lives. When we give, we receive much more in return.</li>
   </ol>
