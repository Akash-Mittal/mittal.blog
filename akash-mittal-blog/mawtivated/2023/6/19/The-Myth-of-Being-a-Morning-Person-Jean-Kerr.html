   <h2>Inspiring Story of Jean Kerr</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>Have you ever been told that waking up early is the key to success and productivity? I used to believe that too until I stumbled upon Jean Kerr's story. She was a successful playwright and author who worked late into the night and struggled to wake up early. She once said, "I write in bed, I write on my feet, I write at the typewriter, I write in my head, but never do I write after breakfast."</p>
   <p>It's a common misconception that waking up early is the only way to be productive. In fact, it's quite the opposite for some people. The average, healthy, well-adjusted adult gets up at seven-thirty in the morning feeling just plain terrible, as Jean Kerr puts it.</p>
   <p>Research shows that our circadian rhythm, or natural body clock, differs from person to person. Some individuals function better at night, while others are more alert in the morning. It doesn't mean that one is superior to the other; it simply means that we have different biological clocks.</p>
   <h3></h3>
   <p>Take me, for example. I used to force myself to wake up at 6 am to be productive. However, I found that I couldn't focus and felt groggy throughout the day. It wasn't until I started working from noon until late at night that I found my productivity skyrocketing. I felt more alert and energized because I was working during my natural peak hours.</p>
   <p>Another personal anecdote is my friend, Mia. She's a doctor who wakes up at 5 am every day to exercise, meditate, and plan out her day. She swears by her morning routine, and it works for her. She finds that she's more focused and productive when she starts her day early.</p>
   <h3>Case Study</h3>
   <p>A study conducted by the University of Westminster found that individuals who identified as night owls scored higher on intelligence tests and had higher incomes than those who identified as morning larks. The study suggests that night owls are more creative and independent, which may contribute to their success.</p>
   <h3>Examples</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Winston Churchill was known to work late into the night and wake up late in the morning.</li>
    <li>Elon Musk is a self-proclaimed night owl who once said, "I don't need much sleep, and I generally work late."</li>
    <li>Oprah Winfrey wakes up at 6 am every day to exercise and meditate, but she also famously works until midnight most nights.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Conclusion</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>Being a morning person isn't necessary to be successful or productive.</li>
    <li>Everyone has different biological clocks, and it's essential to listen to your body and work during your natural peak hours.</li>
    <li>It's important to find a routine that works for you, whether that's waking up early or working late at night.</li>
   </ol>
   <h3>Practical Tips</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Experiment with different work schedules and find out when you're most productive.</li>
    <li>Make sure you're getting enough sleep, regardless of your work schedule.</li>
    <li>Be mindful of your natural peak hours and schedule your work accordingly.</li>
   </ul>
