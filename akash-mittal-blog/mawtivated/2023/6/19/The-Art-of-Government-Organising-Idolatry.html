  <h1>The Art of Government: Organising Idolatry</h1></br> <img src="images/The-Art-of-Government-Organising-Idolatry.jpeg" alt="+The-Art-of-Government-Organising-Idolatry+"></br>
  <p>Once upon a time, in a small village in rural India, there was a wise old man who was known for his ability to bring order to chaos. He was frequently called upon by the villagers to resolve disputes and provide guidance on matters of importance. One day, the local government appointed him as the head of a newly formed council tasked with overseeing the welfare of the village.</p>
  <p>The wise old man immediately knew that the success of the council would depend on its ability to instill a sense of pride and purpose in the villagers. He recognized that a government without the support of its people was like a ship without a sail, adrift and directionless.</p>
  <p>So he set about organizing a festival to celebrate the village's rich cultural heritage. He invited musicians, dancers, and artists from neighboring villages to perform and showcase their talents. He also encouraged the villagers to participate in the festival by sharing their stories, traditions, and customs.</p>
  <p>The festival was a huge success and brought the village together in a way that had not been seen before. The villagers felt a sense of belonging and pride in their community, and the council gained their trust and respect. The wise old man had used the power of idolatry to organize the government and bring order to the village.</p>
