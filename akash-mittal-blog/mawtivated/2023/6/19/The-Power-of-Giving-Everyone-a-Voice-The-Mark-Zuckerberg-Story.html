  <p>It all started in a Harvard dorm room in 2004. A young Mark Zuckerberg and his friends created a social networking site called Facebook. Little did they know that this small project would change the world forever.</p>
  <p>Facebook was designed to connect college students in the United States but quickly grew to become a platform that united people all over the world. It gave people the power to connect, share their stories, and most importantly, it gave them a voice.</p>
  <p>Mark Zuckerberg once said "When you give everyone a voice and give people power, the system usually ends up in a really good place. So, what we view our role as, is giving people that power."</p>
