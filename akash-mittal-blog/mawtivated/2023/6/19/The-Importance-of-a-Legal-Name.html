   <h2>How A Legal Name Can Make a Difference</h2>

   <h3>An Inspirational Story</h3>
   <p>When Sarah was born, she was given her mother's last name because her father was not present in her life. Although Sarah never knew her father, she always felt like she was missing a part of her identity because she did not have his last name.</p>
   <p>Years later, Sarah finally met her father and was overjoyed to discover that she had siblings. However, when she went to school and tried to enroll using her legal name, she encountered numerous obstacles. The school had trouble finding her records, and her classmates teased her for having a different last name than her mother and siblings.</p>
   <p>It wasn't until Sarah legally changed her last name to her father's that she felt a sense of belonging. She no longer had to explain or defend her name, and felt a sense of pride in being part of her father's family.</p>
   <h3></h3>
   <p>Like Sarah, many people feel a strong connection to their name, and not having a legal claim to it can cause a lot of emotional distress. Harriet Ann Jacobs, an American writer and abolitionist, wrote in her autobiography that "always it gave me a pang that my children had no lawful claim to a name." Jacobs, who was born into slavery, was not legally allowed to own property or establish a legal name for her children. This lack of legal recognition was one way that slaveholders sought to dehumanize and control their slaves.</p>
   <p>Even in modern times, not having a legal name can have negative consequences. Children born out of wedlock or to parents who are not married may not automatically have a legal claim to their father's last name. This can cause confusion and legal issues down the road, especially if the child needs to establish their identity for things like enrolling in school or getting a passport. It can also be emotionally difficult for the child if they feel like they are missing a part of their identity.</p>
   <h3>Examples</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>John was born to a single mother and did not have a legal claim to his father's last name. When he got married, he decided to take his wife's last name instead of his own because he never felt connected to his birth name.</li>
    <li>Alice was born to a mother who was married but chose not to give her child the father's last name. This caused a lot of tension between the parents and led to legal battles over child custody.</li>
    <li>Mike was adopted as a child, and his legal name was changed to his adoptive parents' last name. This helped him feel like he was part of his new family and gave him a sense of belonging.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Conclusion</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>A legal name is an important part of a person's identity.</li>
    <li>Not having a legal claim to a name can cause emotional distress and legal issues.</li>
    <li>It is important to establish a legal name for yourself and your children to ensure their rights and identities are protected.</li>
   </ol>
