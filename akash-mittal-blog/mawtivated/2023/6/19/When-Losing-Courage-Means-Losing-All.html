    <h2>An Inspiring Story of Courage</h2>
    <p>When Maria was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer, everyone around her was devastated. Her family and friends tried their best to support her, but they could see the fear in her eyes. Maria knew that fighting this cancer was going to be the toughest thing she had ever done. But she also knew that giving up was not an option.</p>
    <p>Despite the grueling treatments and the pain, Maria refused to lose hope. She found strength in the love of her family and the determination to beat the odds. One day, she told her doctor, "I know that I may lose my hair, my strength, and my appetite, but I will not lose my courage."</p>
    <p>Years later, Maria is cancer-free and she often speaks about the importance of courage. She realized that when she had lost everything else - her health, her looks, her energy - what kept her going was her courage.</p>

    <h2>He Who Loses Courage Loses All</h2>
    <p>The famous quote by Miguel de Cervantes perfectly sums up the importance of courage in life. Courage is what gives us the strength to face our fears, to take risks, and to fight for what we believe in. Without courage, we are lost.</p>
    <p>Courage is not just about facing big challenges like cancer or overcoming adversity. It is also about having the courage to speak up, to stand for what is right, to ask for help, and to take responsibility for our actions. Without courage, we cannot move forward in life.</p>
    <p>In fact, losing courage can be more detrimental than losing wealth or friendship. When we lose our wealth, we may experience financial hardship and struggle to live the same lifestyle as before. When we lose a friend, we may feel lonely and miss their companionship. But when we lose our courage, we lose the ability to face life with determination and hope.</p>
