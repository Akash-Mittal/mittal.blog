   <p>I always knew that I wanted to become a doctor. As a child, I would spend countless hours reading books on medicine, anatomy, and biology. I thought that pursuing a career in medicine was the only way I could make a meaningful difference in the world.</p>
   <p>However, when I was in high school, I realized that I could not afford to pay for college tuition. My parents were unable to finance my education, and I did not receive any scholarships or bursaries. I was crushed when I realized that I may have to abandon my dreams of becoming a doctor.</p>
   <p>But I refused to give up. I was determined to find a way to pay for my education.</p>
   <h3>Perseverance Pays Off</h3>
   <p>After graduating from high school, I decided to take a gap year to work and save money. I worked long hours at a part-time job, and I volunteered at a local hospital. I knew that I had to gain experience and build my resume to increase my chances of being accepted into medical school.</p>
   <p>After a year of hard work, I was able to save enough money to enroll in college. I took out student loans and applied for financial aid to pay for my tuition. Even though I faced significant financial challenges, I was determined to succeed.</p>
   <h3>Lessons Learned on the Journey</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Never give up on your dreams, even in the face of adversity. With hard work and determination, anything is possible.</li>
    <li>Gain experience in your desired field. Volunteer, intern, or work part-time to build your resume and increase your chances of being accepted into graduate school.</li>
    <li>Seek out financial assistance. There are many scholarships, bursaries, and financial aid options available for students who demonstrate financial need and academic potential.</li>
