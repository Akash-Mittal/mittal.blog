   <p>John was an ordinary guy with an extraordinary dream. He wanted to become an entrepreneur and start his own business. He had the drive and determination, but he lacked the capital to get started. He spent many days and nights worrying about how he would come up with the funds to turn his dream into a reality. But one day, he had an epiphany.</p>
   <blockquote>
    "Success is having to worry about every damn thing in the world, except money." - Johnny Cash
   </blockquote>
   <p>John realized that success didn't have to be defined by how much money he had in his bank account. He saw success as the ability to master every aspect of his life, except money. He began to focus on improving his health, his relationships, his mental and emotional well-being, and his personal growth. He discovered that when he stopped obsessing over money, he was able to achieve success in a way that felt authentic and fulfilling to him.</p>
   <h2>The Key to Mastering Your Life Except Money</h2>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>Set Your Own Definition of Success:</strong> Too often, we let society or other people dictate what success should look like for us. But success is a deeply personal and subjective concept. Take some time to reflect on what success means to you. What are the values and principles that you want to live by? How do you want to contribute to the world? When you have a clear sense of your own definition of success, it becomes easier to prioritize the things that matter most to you.</li>
    <li><strong>Focus on What You Can Control:</strong> We tend to worry a lot about things that are outside of our control, like the stock market, the weather, or other people's opinions. But when we focus on what we can control, like our thoughts, actions, and attitudes, we become more empowered and resilient. Don't waste your energy on things you can't change. Instead, channel your energy into building the habits and skills that will allow you to master your life except money.</li>
    <li><strong>Celebrate Your Wins:</strong> It's easy to get caught up in the endless pursuit of success, and forget to celebrate the milestones along the way. Take time to acknowledge and appreciate your achievements, no matter how small they may seem. Celebrating your wins helps you stay motivated and reinforces the positive habits and behaviors that have led to your success so far.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>Examples of Mastering Your Life Except Money</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Focusing on your health by starting a workout routine, adopting a healthy diet, and prioritizing self-care</li>
    <li>Building strong relationships with family, friends, and colleagues by practicing active listening, empathizing, and showing appreciation</li>
    <li>Prioritizing personal growth by reading books, attending workshops, and seeking feedback from mentors</li>
    <li>Volunteering or giving back to your community in meaningful ways</li>
    <li>Starting a passion project or hobby that brings you joy and fulfillment</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Success is not just about money. Define your own version of success and focus on the things that matter most to you.</li>
    <li>Focus on what you can control, and let go of worries that are outside of your sphere of influence.</li>
    <li>Celebrate your wins and appreciate the journey of mastering every aspect of your life except money.</li>
   </ol>
