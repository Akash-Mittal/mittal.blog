   <p>Once upon a time, there was a man named John who lived a miserable life. He had a job he hated, no friends, and no true purpose. John believed that life was a burden and that joy was only reserved for those who were lucky enough to have it handed to them. One day, John met a wise old man who listened patiently to his story. The old man looked at John and said, "It is normal to give away a little of one's life in order not to lose it all." These words changed John's life forever.</p>
   <p>Author Albert Camus once said, "The only way to deal with fear is to face it head-on." John realized that he had been living his entire life in fear, constantly worrying about what others thought of him and believing that he was not worthy of love or success. He decided to take the old man's advice and started giving back to his community.</p>
