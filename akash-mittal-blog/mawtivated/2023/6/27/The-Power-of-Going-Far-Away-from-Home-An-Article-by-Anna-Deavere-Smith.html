  <p>As a young woman, Anna Deavere Smith had a choice to make. She could write about what she knew - women's experiences in America, or she could go far away from home and explore places that were new to her imagination. She chose the latter.</p>
  <p>In recent decades, Anna Deavere Smith has become an iconic figure in American theatre. She is a playwright, actor, and professor who has made a career out of exploring the voices and stories of people from all walks of life. Her work has taken her to communities across the globe, where she has listened and learned from people whose experiences are vastly different from her own.</p>
  <p>Through her unique approach to storytelling, Anna Deavere Smith has discovered the incredible power of going far away from home. In this article, we'll explore why this is so important, and how you can harness the power of exploration for your own creative work.</p>
  <h2>The Benefits of Going Far Away from Home</h2>
  <p>Many artists, writers, and creatives believe that the best work comes from writing what you know. While there is certainly some truth to this, Anna Deavere Smith argues that there is a lot of value in going far away from home in order to expand our imaginations.</p>
  <p>For Anna Deavere Smith, the act of going far away from home doesn't necessarily mean physically leaving your hometown. Rather, it means stepping outside of your comfort zone and exploring new ideas, concepts, and perspectives.</p>
  <p>Here are just a few of the benefits of going far away from home:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>Fostering Creativity</strong> - When we are exposed to new experiences, our brains are forced to process information differently. This can lead to new ideas, insights, and perspectives that we may not have arrived at otherwise.</li>
   <li><strong>Breaking Through Creative Blocks</strong> - If you're feeling stuck in your creative work, sometimes the best thing to do is step back and take a break. Going far away from home can be a great way to hit the reset button and come back to your work with fresh eyes.</li>
   <li><strong>Broadening Your Audience</strong> - If you only write about what you know, you may be limiting your audience. By exploring new perspectives and experiences, you can appeal to a wider range of readers and viewers.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Examples of Going Far Away from Home</h2>
  <p>If you're still not convinced of the value of going far away from home, just look at the incredible work that Anna Deavere Smith has created throughout her career. Here are a few examples:</p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>"Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992" was a play that Anna Deavere Smith created in response to the Los Angeles riots that took place in the aftermath of the Rodney King verdict. In order to create the play, she interviewed more than 200 people from all walks of life - from police officers to victims of police brutality - in order to capture the complex emotions and perspectives that were present during this tumultuous time in American history."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
   <p>"Let Me Down Easy" was another play that Anna Deavere Smith created after traveling to various hospitals around the world and speaking with doctors, nurses, and patients about their experiences with illness and healing. The play explores the relationship between the body, the spirit, and the systems that we create as humans to care for one another."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>By going as far away from home as possible, both physically and mentally, Anna Deavere Smith has been able to create work that is incredibly powerful, unique, and moving.</p>
