    <p>When I was in college, I had a professor who constantly questioned my abilities. He would give me low grades on assignments without any feedback on what I did wrong. I felt demotivated and doubted my intelligence. But I didn't let that stop me from pursuing my dreams. I sought help from other professors, worked harder, and eventually proved that I was capable of achieving great things.</p>
