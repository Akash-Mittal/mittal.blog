   <p>Sheila is a 29-year-old mother of two living in sub-Saharan Africa. She was diagnosed with HIV when she was pregnant with her first child. She was devastated, scared, and unsure of what the future held. But she didn't give up. She started taking medication, went to support groups, and learned everything she could about living with HIV. Today, Sheila is an advocate for women living with HIV and fights for their rights and access to treatment.</p><!-- INCLUDE AUTHOR STORY OR BACKGROUND HERE -->
   <blockquote>
    "I can't understand why the front pages of newspapers can cover bird flu and swine flu and everybody is up in arms about that and we still haven't really woken up to the fact that so many women in sub-Saharan Africa - 60 percent of people in - infected with HIV are women." - Annie Lennox
   </blockquote>
   <p><strong>Annie Lennox</strong>, a Scottish singer and activist, has been a vocal advocate for women and HIV/AIDS awareness for over a decade. Lennox has worked tirelessly to raise awareness for the high rates of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa and has campaigned for global action to support those affected by the disease.</p>

   <h2>The Reality of HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa</h2>
   <p>Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest rate of HIV/AIDS in the world, accounting for 71% of all new HIV infections in 2019. Of the 38 million people living with HIV, 19 million are women. In some countries in southern Africa, young women aged 15-24 are up to eight times more likely to be infected with HIV than their male peers.</p>
   <p>The reasons for this are complex, but largely stem from gender inequality, poverty, limited access to education and healthcare, and cultural norms around gender roles and sexuality.</p>
   <h2>The Impact of HIV on Women</h2>
   <p>Women living with HIV face unique challenges, including stigma and discrimination, lack of support from their families and communities, and limited access to healthcare and treatment.</p>
   <p>Many women living with HIV also face a higher risk of violence and abuse, which can further impact their physical and mental health. According to the World Health Organization, women living with HIV are twice as likely to experience intimate partner violence than women who are HIV-negative.</p><!-- INCLUDE PART 2 OF THE ARTICLE HERE -->
   <h2>The Importance of Women's Voices</h2>
   <p>Despite the challenges they face, women living with HIV are powerful advocates for change. Their voices and experiences must be heard in the fight against HIV/AIDS.</p>
   <p>Women living with HIV have been instrumental in campaigning for access to treatment and prevention services, as well as advocating for policies that address gender inequality and support women's rights.</p>
