    <p>It was a dark and stormy night. The streets were empty, and the wind howled through the trees. A group of teenagers were huddled under a shelter, waiting for the bus that never came. Suddenly, a figure emerged from the darkness, dressed in black from head to toe. It was Marilyn Manson, and he had a message to deliver: "The time that people aren't expecting what's going to happen, I find that's the best time to really cause the damage that needs to be done."</p>
    <p>This statement might seem shocking and even alarming to some, but it speaks to the power of surprise in creating change. Marilyn Manson is known for his controversial and provocative music, style, and persona, and his approach to causing damage is no different.</p>
