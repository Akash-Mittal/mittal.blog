    <h2>Look on Them as Your Own Beloved Sons</h2>

By looking on your soldiers as your own beloved sons, you establish a sense of pride and belonging that will motivate them to follow you into the toughest of battles. Soldiers want to be a part of something bigger than themselves and feel that their sacrifices are appreciated.</p>
    <blockquote>
     "We love to feel that our lives count for something and that we make a difference in the world. Strong leaders help soldiers believe they are doing something that matters. They help them understand that they are part of a game that is bigger than themselves, and that they stand on the right side of history."

     <li>Clearly communicate their appreciation for the soldiers' sacrifices.</li>
     <li>Encourage and praise the courage and bravery of the soldiers.</li>
