   <h3>An Inspiring Story that Proves the Power of Love</h3>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>Once upon a time, there was a woman named Eva Gabor. She was a Hungarian actress who moved to the United States in the 1940s to pursue her dreams. She became a popular television personality and starred in several Hollywood films. But despite her professional success, Eva was not lucky in love.</p>
   <p>She had been married five times, and all of her marriages failed. She was starting to lose hope of finding true love. But then she met Merv Griffin, an American television host, and business magnate. They fell in love and became a couple in their 50s. They were together until Eva's death in 1995.</p>
   <p>Eva's story is a perfect example of how love can come when you least expect it. Even after several failed marriages, Eva did not give up on love. She kept looking for it until she found it. And when she did, she played the game of love in such a way that both she and Merv Griffin won.</p>
   <h2>Love: The Game That Two Can Play and Both Win</h2>
   <p>Love is not a competition where one person wins, and the other loses. It is a game where both players can win. But to play the game of love and win, both players need to understand the rules and make an effort.</p>
   <h3>The Rules of the Game</h3>
   <p>The first rule of the game is to respect each other. Respect is the foundation on which a successful relationship is built. If both players respect each other, they will not hurt each other intentionally.</p>
   <p>The second rule is to communicate. Communication is the key to any successful relationship. Both players need to express their thoughts, feelings, and opinions openly and honestly. If both players communicate effectively, they will not have to guess what the other one is thinking.</p>
   <p>The third rule is to compromise. Compromise is essential in any relationship. Both players need to be willing to give and take. If both players are not willing to compromise, the relationship will not last.</p>
   <h3>Examples of Winners</h3>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Barack and Michelle Obama:</strong> They have been married for over 28 years and have shown the world what a healthy relationship looks like. They respect each other, communicate effectively, and compromise.</li>
    <li><strong>Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson:</strong> They have been married for over 33 years, and their love story is an inspiration to many. They have faced many challenges, including Tom's health issues, but they have always stood by each other.</li>

   </ul>
   <h3>Practical Tips for Winning</h3>
   <ul>
    <li><em>Express Gratitude:</em> Let your partner know that you appreciate them and what they do for you. Saying "thank you" will go a long way in keeping the love alive.</li>
    <li><em>Spend Quality Time Together:</em> Make time for each other and do things that you both enjoy. Spending time together will strengthen your bond.</li>
