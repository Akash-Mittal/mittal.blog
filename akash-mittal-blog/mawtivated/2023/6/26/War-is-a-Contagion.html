   <h1>The Devastating Effects of War: A Contagion that Spreads</h1></br> <img src="images/War-is-a-Contagion.jpeg" alt="+War-is-a-Contagion+"></br>
   <h2>Inspiring Story</h2>
   <p>It was the year 2008 when a man named Juan Mann started a campaign for Free Hugs. He stood on the streets with a sign that read 'Free Hugs' and offered hugs to anyone who needed one. People were hesitant at first, but eventually, they warmed up and hugged the man. The campaign spread like wildfire and soon, people all over the world were offering free hugs. This story is a perfect example of how positivity can spread just like negativity. The same is true for war.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The quote "War is a contagion" was said by Franklin D. Roosevelt just after World War I. The statement still rings true to this day. War has never been beneficial for anyone. It spreads like a disease and engulfs entire nations in its wrath. It is an issue that has plagued humanity since the dawn of time, but one that we still have not been able to solve completely.</p>

    <h2>Why War is a Contagion</h2>
    <ol>
     <li><strong>Impact on Civilians:</strong> War has a devastating impact on civilians. Homes and livelihoods are destroyed, families are separated, and children are forced to live in fear. The trauma of war stays with them for years and can cause long term physical, mental and emotional damage.</li>
     <li><strong>Escalation:</strong> War has the power to escalate quickly. It starts with a small event and can quickly spiral out of control. Nations are dragged into war over minor disputes, and once they are in, it is difficult to get out.</li>
     <li><strong>Revenge:</strong> War creates a desire for revenge. When one side wins, they want to make sure the other side feels the same pain they did. This creates a cycle of violence that is difficult to break.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>World War I started after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, but it was not the actual trigger. The event was just an excuse for countries to declare war on each other, turning a regional conflict into a global war.</li>
     <li>In 2003, the Iraq War was declared by the US leading to a civil war that still continues today. The decision was based on false intelligence, and it led to the death of over 4,000 US soldiers and countless Iraqi civilians.</li>
     <li>In the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine, both sides are engaged in a cycle of violence that has lasted for decades with no end in sight. The conflict has taken countless lives, destroyed homes, and has had a devastating impact on the civilian population.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Can Stop the Contagion</h2>
    <p>War is not a problem that we can solve overnight, but we can take small steps towards peace. Here are a few tips:</p>
    <ul>
     <li><strong>Empathy:</strong> It is essential to understand the other person's perspective. If we can empathize with them, we can have a better chance of resolving the issue without violence.</li>
     <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Wars happen when countries do not communicate effectively. It is necessary to have open channels of communication and to talk through any issues before they escalate.</li>
     <li><strong>Education:</strong> Education is the key to peace. The more we educate ourselves and others about the impact of war, the more we can prevent it from happening in the first place.</li>
    </ul>
