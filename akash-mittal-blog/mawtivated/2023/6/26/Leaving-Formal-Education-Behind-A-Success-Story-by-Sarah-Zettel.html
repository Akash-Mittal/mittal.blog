   <p>When I graduated from the University of Michigan with a BA in Communications, I thought that was it for me. I was done with formal education and ready to start my career. But little did I know that leaving formal education behind would be the best decision I ever made.</p>
   <h3>Why I Left Formal Education Behind</h3>
   <p>I wasn't always sure about leaving formal education behind. Like most students, I thought that getting a degree from a prestigious university was the key to success. But as I progressed through my coursework, I began to feel disillusioned. I realized that I was not excited about the requirements and regulations of formal education.</p>
   <p>Moreover, I was deeply dissatisfied with the quality of the education I was receiving. The coursework for my major seemed outdated and impractical. One day, I was discussing my frustrations with a professor and he said: "It sounds like you want to learn what you're passionate about. You don't need a degree for that." That simple statement changed my life.</p>
   <h3>How I Succeeded Without Formal Education</h3>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Identify Your Passions:</strong> When I left formal education behind, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. But I knew I was passionate about writing. So I started writing as much as possible. I wrote articles, short stories, and eventually, novels. I learned everything I could about writing by reading books, attending workshops, and practicing my craft.</li>
    <li><strong>Build Your Network:</strong> As important as it was to learn on my own, I found it equally critical to connect with other people who shared my interests. I attended writing conferences, joined writing groups, and became an active member of writing communities. These connections, as much as my ability to write, helped me become a successful author.</li>
    <li><strong>Create Opportunities:</strong> The biggest challenge of leaving formal education behind was creating opportunities for myself. But I started small and eventually built a career writing novels and articles for major publications. I created my own opportunities by taking risks, submitting my work to contests and publishers, and persistently seeking out new connections and resources.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Key Takeaways for Success</h3>
   <p>Leaving formal education behind may seem daunting, but it is not impossible to succeed. Some key takeaways from my journey include:</p>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>Follow your passions:</strong> Life is short, so it's important to do what you love. Pursue activities and interests that genuinely excite you.</li>
    <li><strong>Bulk up your networks:</strong> Meeting new people who share your interests can open up new opportunities and career paths. Join online forums, attend meet-ups or conferences to grow your network.</li>
    <li><strong>Take calculated risks:</strong> Opportunities don't come to those who wait. Take a chance on yourself and seek out ways to become a doer, not a watcher, get involved in projects and commit to your work.</li>
   </ol>
