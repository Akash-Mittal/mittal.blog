   <p>When I was a child, I remember playing with kids from different backgrounds and races. We were all having a good time, laughing and learning from one another. It never occurred to me that there was any difference between us based on the color of our skin. Sadly, not all children have this privilege.</p>
   <p>It is heartbreaking to see how in some parts of the world, children are separated from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race. This generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.</p>
   <h2>Author - Earl Warren Story or Background</h2>
   <p>Earl Warren was an American politician and jurist who served as the 30th Governor of California and later as the Chief Justice of the United States. He is best known for his leadership in the landmark case <strong>Brown v. Board of Education</strong>, which declared segregation in public schools to be unconstitutional.</p>
   <p>Warren's commitment to equality and justice for all served as an inspiration for many who fought against discrimination and racism. He understood that separating children based on their race not only had a negative impact on the individual but also on society as a whole.</p>
   <h2>Examples of the Feeling of Inferiority</h2>
   <h3>Case Studies</h3>
   <p>A study conducted by psychologists Kennon M. Sheldon and Geoffrey Williams showed that when African-American students were primed to think about their race before taking an intellectual test, they performed worse than when they were not reminded of their race. The researchers concluded that thinking about their race caused the students to feel anxious and to doubt their abilities.</p>
   <p>Another study conducted by sociologists Amy Farrell and Karida Brown found that African-American students who attended predominantly white schools felt like they had to work harder than their white peers to prove their competence. They felt like their intelligence was constantly being called into question, leading to feelings of stress and anxiety.</p>
   <h3></h3>
   <p>One of my friends, who is African-American, shared with me his experience of being the only black student in a predominantly white school. He recounted how he felt out of place and like he did not belong. He talked about how teachers would sometimes dismiss his ideas and how other students would make hurtful comments.</p>
   <p>Although my friend excelled academically, he felt like he had to work twice as hard to prove himself. He struggled with feelings of inferiority and would often question whether he was smart enough or good enough.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion: The Negative Impact of Separating Children Based on Their Race</h2>

    <li>Separating children based on their race generates a feeling of inferiority that can have long-lasting negative effects on their hearts and minds.</li>
    <li>Children who are forced to attend segregated schools or who feel like they do not belong because of their race may experience stress, anxiety, and a lack of self-confidence.</li>
    <li>We must work to create inclusive and diverse communities where all children can thrive and feel accepted for who they are.</li>
   </ul>
