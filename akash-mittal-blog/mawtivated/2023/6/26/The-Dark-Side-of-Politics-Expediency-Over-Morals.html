   <h2>An Inspiring Story of How Politics Can be Corrupt</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>Once upon a time, there was a small village that had long been neglected by their government. The roads were potholed, the hospitals lacked basic facilities, and the schools were dilapidated. No government official, not even the local representatives, had paid the village a visit in ages.</p>
   <p>One day, a young and charismatic leader came to the village, promising to change their plight. He rallied the villagers, promising them a bright future if they supported him. He climbed the political ladder with ease, finally getting elected to a powerful position in the central government.</p>
   <p>The villagers, who had believed in him and had voted for him, now expected him to deliver on his promises. But, to their disappointment, he never returned to the village. He had no more use for them, now that he held power.</p>
   <p>This story is a testimony to the fact that politics can often be driven by expediency rather than morals, and power can be used to serve personal interests rather than the greater good. It is also a reflection of how leaders should not use their positions of power to serve their own ends.</p>
   <h3 background-color="#d9d9d9">The Story Behind the Quote</h3>
   <blockquote>
    "There are no morals in politics; there is only expediency. A scoundrel may be of use to us just because he is a scoundrel." - Vladimir Lenin
   </blockquote>
   <p>Vladimir Lenin, the founder of the Soviet Union, is known for his contributions to Marxist theory and his revolutionary socialist ideas. During his political career, Lenin was known to make controversial statements in regard to politics and power, such as the quote mentioned above.</p>
   <p>Lenin's statement implies that politicians use expediency, or doing what is convenient or self-serving, to achieve their goals. A scoundrel, or a morally bankrupt individual, could be of use to a politician because they are willing to do what others may not. This mentality has the potential to corrupt the political process, as politicians may be willing to overlook ethical concerns in pursuit of their objectives.</p>
   <h3>Examples of Expediency Over Morals in Politics</h3>
   <p>The world has witnessed numerous examples of politicians prioritizing expediency over morals. Here are a few notable ones:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>In the Watergate scandal of 1972, operatives of the Nixon administration broke into the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, D.C. to steal sensitive campaign information. Despite the ensuing investigation, Nixon's team was caught and forced to resign, a clear indication of how attempting to abuse power can backfire.</li>
    <li>Recently, India passed two farm laws that farmers across India opposed, but the ruling government passed them anyway. This move was seen as being politically expedient, as the government was able to push through its ideas without consulting the farmers. This caused large-scale protests, leading to the death of a number of farmers and was a clear example of abuse of power in politics.</li>
    <li>During the infamous apartheid era in South Africa, politicians justified the regime's segregationist policies by arguing that they were protecting the interests of their people, even though such policies had devastating effects on the Black community. This was an example of putting self-interest before the greater good.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Three Key Take-Aways</h3>
   <p>It is clear that politics can often be dominated by expediency, leading to unethical behavior by politicians. However, three key takeaways can help to mitigate this issue:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Integrity is a key element of ethical behavior. This means that politicians need to be honest and transparent in all their dealings and avoid using their positions for personal gain.</li>
    <li>Listening to the people being impacted is a crucial component of ethical decision-making. This means that leaders should not act on their whims but instead collaborate with the people they are meant to serve to make the right decisions.</li>
    <li>Finally, only selfless leaders can be trusted to put the greater good ahead of personal interest. Politicians must work tirelessly to represent the fundamental values of their people, resisting the temptation to stray when it appears politically convenient for them to do so.</li>
   </ol>
