  <p>Have you ever heard of Helen Hayes? She was an American actress who was one of the most successful leading ladies of her time. She won an Oscar, a Tony Award, and an Emmy Award, and her career spanned over seven decades.</p>
  <p>But did you know that when she first started out, she was told that she wasn't pretty enough to be an actress? Despite this setback, she persevered and went on to become one of the most celebrated actresses of her time.</p>
  <p>This just goes to show that being an actor is not just about having good looks or the right hair color. It's about hard work, dedication, and a willingness to overcome obstacles.</p>
