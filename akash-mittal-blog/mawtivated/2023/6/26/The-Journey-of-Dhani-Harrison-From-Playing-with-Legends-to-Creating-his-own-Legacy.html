   <h2>From Playing with Legends to Creating his own Legacy</h2>

  <main>
   <p>It was a hot summer day in London, and the young Dhani Harrison was backstage at the Royal Albert Hall. He was there to support his father, the legendary George Harrison, who was headlining the historic venue. Dhani was nervous but excited; this was his first taste of what it meant to be a musician. As he looked around, he saw some of the biggest names in the industry, all gathered to pay homage to his father and his incredible career.</p>
   <p>As the lights dimmed and the audience roared, George took the stage, and Dhani watched in awe as his father transformed into a musical legend before his very eyes. The music filled the hall, and everyone in attendance was swept up in the moment. It was then that Dhani knew he wanted to be a musician too - he wanted to continue the legacy that his father had created.</p>
   <h3>A Pedigree in Music</h3>
   <p>Dhani Harrison had been born into a family that was deeply rooted in music. His father, as a member of the Beatles, was one of the biggest names in the industry, and his mother was a successful musician and producer in her own right. From an early age, Dhani was exposed to the incredible power of music, whether it was through hearing his father's classic tunes or attending concerts and musical events around the world.</p>
   <blockquote>
    "I did Albert Hall, I got to play the Hall of Fame with Prince. So I've done that kind of stuff for ages. It wasn't until after we finished working on Brainwash, my dad's album after he died, then it was like 'That phase is over in my life now, now we can get on with our music, with our band.'"
   </blockquote>
   <p>As Dhani grew up, he became more and more fascinated with music and began to play various instruments. His father was his biggest influence, but he also drew inspiration from a wide range of genres and artists. He played with bands and experimented with different sounds, all while trying to find his own voice in the world of music.</p>
   <h3>Crafting his Own Legacy</h3>
   <p>It wasn't until Dhani's father passed away that he truly began to focus on creating his own musical legacy. He felt a sense of responsibility to carry on his father's work, but he knew he also had to forge his own path and create music that was truly his own. He teamed up with a group of like-minded musicians and formed a band called George Harrison's Son, later renaming the band to Thenewno2. Together, they created a unique sound that was influenced by everything from electronic music to Indian classical music.</p>
   <p>After years of hard work and collaboration, Dhani finally released his debut solo album, "In Parallel," in 2017. The album was a critical success, with fans and critics alike praising Dhani's ability to create something that was both fresh and familiar. He had taken the lessons he had learned from his father and combined them with his own unique perspective to create something that was truly special.</p>
   <h3>The Power of Legacy</h3>
   <p>Dhani's journey is a testament to the power of legacy - how the lessons and experiences of those who came before us can shape our own lives and careers. But it's also a reminder that we all have the power to create our own legacies, to take what we've learned and use it to create something new and innovative.</p>
   <h3>Conclusion</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Legacy is a powerful force that can inspire and drive us forward.</li>
    <li>We can learn from those who came before us, but we also have to forge our own paths.</li>
    <li>Creating something new and innovative is what sets us apart and helps us leave our own mark on the world.</li>
   </ul>
