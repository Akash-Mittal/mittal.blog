    <h2>An Inspiring Story</h2>
    <p>Imagine you're a new author just starting out. You've spent years perfecting your craft and now finally have a book ready to share with the world. You're excited to see what readers think and eagerly anticipate reviews from professional critics.</p>
    <p>But the first review that comes in is scathing. The reviewer didn't like your characters, your plot, or your writing style and they make sure everyone knows it. You're devastated and begin to doubt your abilities as a writer.</p>
    <p>This scenario is all too common for many authors, including John Grisham, the best-selling author of legal thrillers. In his early career, Grisham received many negative reviews, some of which nearly caused him to give up writing entirely.</p>
    <blockquote>
     "I have learned not to read reviews. Period. And I hate reviewers. All of them, or at least all but two or three. Life is much simpler ignoring reviews and the nasty people who write them. Critics should find meaningful work." - John Grisham
    </blockquote>
    <p>After struggling with reviews, Grisham ultimately decided to focus on his writing and ignore the critics. And this decision has paid off - he has sold over 300 million books worldwide, making him one of the most successful authors of all time.</p>

    <h2>Author - John Grisham Story or Background</h2>
    <p>John Grisham was born on February 8, 1955 in Jonesboro, Arkansas. He grew up in a small town in Mississippi and attended Mississippi State University and the University of Mississippi School of Law. After graduating from law school, Grisham practiced law for nearly a decade before turning to writing.</p>
    <p>Grisham's first novel, A Time to Kill, was published in 1989 and was not an immediate success. It wasn't until the publication of his second novel, The Firm, that he became a household name.</p>
    <p>Grisham is known for his legal thrillers, which often deal with themes of corruption, justice, and ethics. He has published over 40 books and many of them have been turned into movies or television shows.</p>

    <h2>Why You Shouldn't Trust Critics</h2>
    <p>So, why does John Grisham hate critics? And why should you take his advice and ignore them? Here are a few reasons:</p>
    <ul>
     <li><strong>Critics often have their own agenda:</strong> Critics may have certain biases or preferences that can affect their reviews. For example, if a critic doesn't like a particular genre, they may be more likely to give a negative review to any book that falls within that genre.</li>
     <li><strong>Critics may not represent your target audience:</strong> Critics are not always representative of the general reading population. They may have different tastes, interests, or values than your target audience, which can lead to reviews that are not helpful or accurate.</li>
     <li><strong>Critics aren't always right:</strong> Ultimately, reviews are just one person's opinion. What one person loves, another person may hate. And just because someone is a professional critic doesn't mean they always know what they're talking about.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Of course, this isn't to say that all reviews or critics are bad. There are certainly some reviewers who provide honest, thoughtful feedback that can be helpful to authors. But as John Grisham points out, it's important to be cautious and not rely on reviews too heavily.</p>
    <p>So, what should you do if you receive negative reviews? First and foremost, don't take them personally. Remember that reviews are just one person's opinion and don't define your worth as a writer.</p>
    <p>Second, focus on what you can control: your writing. Keep honing your craft, getting feedback from beta readers or critique partners, and improving your skills. The more you can focus on your own work and less on the opinions of others, the better off you'll be.</p>
    <p>And finally, don't be afraid to take a page from John Grisham's book and ignore the critics altogether. Life is too short to waste time and energy on negativity - focus on the positive and keep writing!</p>
