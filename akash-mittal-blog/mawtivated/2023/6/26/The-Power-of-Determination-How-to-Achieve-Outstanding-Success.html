    <h2 class="article-heading">An Inspiring Story of Determination</h2>
    <p class="article-paragraph">In 2008, a 30-year-old woman named Diana Nyad made her fifth attempt to swim from Cuba to Florida, a distance of 110 miles through shark-infested waters. In previous attempts, she had been stung by jellyfish, suffered from dehydration, and battled hallucinations. But on her fifth try, equipped with a new team and a renewed sense of determination, she finally succeeded. She became the first person to complete the swim without a shark cage, and at the age of 64 she proved that it's never too late to achieve your dreams.</p>
    <blockquote class="article-quote">
     "The journey was difficult, but I would not give up. I had a dream, and I was determined to make it come true."
    </blockquote>

People of all ages, backgrounds, and abilities have accomplished amazing things simply because they refused to quit. As the famous quote goes, "Most men succeed because they are determined to."</p>
