  <h1>How to Get Back into Reading as a Gen Xer</h1> <img src="images/How-to-Get-Back-into-Reading-as-a-Gen-Xer.jpeg" alt="+How-to-Get-Back-into-Reading-as-a-Gen-Xer+"><!-- Start of article with an interesting story -->
  <p>As a Gen Xer, you might remember the days when you eagerly flipped through pages of books in high school. You'd get lost in the worlds created by your favorite authors and couldn't wait to discover new stories to read. But now, as an adult, reading has taken a backseat to other responsibilities and activities. Maybe you've even forgotten why you enjoyed it in the first place.</p>
  <p>Recently, I met up with some old college friends and we got talking about books. I realized I had nothing to contribute to the conversation. It hit me that I had stopped reading since 12th grade, and I felt embarrassed. I used to love reading, but now I couldn't even remember the last time I had picked up a book.</p>
  <p>But, I decided it was time to make a change. Reading has so many benefits and it's never too late to pick up a book again. Here are some tips on how to reignite your love for reading as a Gen Xer:</p><!-- Three quantifiable examples -->
  
  <ol>
   <li>Set a reading goal</li>
   <p>Challenge yourself to read a certain number of books in a year. You can start with a small goal, like 10 books, and increase it as you become more comfortable with reading again. Setting a goal will help motivate you, and you'll feel a sense of accomplishment when you reach it.</p>
   <li>Join a book club</li>
   <p>Joining a book club is a great way to meet people who share your love for reading. You'll also get exposed to books you wouldn't have otherwise picked up. Discussing books with others can also make the reading experience more enjoyable.</p>
   <li>Switch up your reading material</li>
   <p>Maybe literature isn't your thing anymore. That's okay! There are so many other types of reading material out there that might interest you. Try reading biographies, non-fiction, graphic novels, or even webcomics. Experimenting with different genres might help reignite your love for reading.</p>
  </ol><!-- Personal anecdote -->
  <h2>A Personal Anecdote</h2>
  <p>I used to only read fiction, so I decided to switch it up and read some non-fiction. I picked up a book on history and became completely engrossed. I couldn't believe I was enjoying non-fiction! This experience proved to me that sometimes it's necessary to switch up your reading material in order to rediscover the joy of reading.</p><!-- Practical tips -->
  <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>Carve out time in your schedule for reading</li>
   <p>Block off time in your calendar specifically for reading. This will help you prioritize it and ensure that you're consistently making time for it.</p>
   <li>Read what you enjoy</li>
   <p>Don't force yourself to read something you're not enjoying. This will turn reading into a chore and won't help reignite your love for it. Instead, let yourself be naturally drawn to books you want to read.</p>
   <li>Set a reading environment</li>
   <p>Create a reading environment that's conducive to your enjoyment of reading. This might mean turning off your phone, finding a comfortable spot in your home, and lighting a candle.</p>
  </ol><!-- Conclusion -->
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Reading is a wonderful activity that has numerous benefits. As a Gen Xer who stopped reading after high school, it's never too late to pick up a book again. Set a reading goal, join a book club, or switch up your reading material to reignite your love for reading. Carve out time in your schedule for reading, read what you enjoy, and set a reading environment to make the experience more enjoyable. Ultimately, remember why you loved reading in the first place.</p><!-- References & Hashtags -->
