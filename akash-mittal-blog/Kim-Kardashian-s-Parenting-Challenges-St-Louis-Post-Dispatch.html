    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>Kim Kardashian, the reality TV star and fashion icon, has opened up about the challenges of being a parent, saying she cries herself to sleep some nights.</p>
    <p>In an interview with <i>The Today Show</i>, Kardashian said that one of the hardest things about parenting was coping with "the most intense anxiety" she had ever experienced.</p>
    <p>"My whole world is my kids, it's just all my world, so to make sure that they're okay, I have to be okay," she said.</p>
    <p>Kardashian has two children with her husband Kanye West, daughter North and son Saint. She also has two younger children, daughter Chicago and son Psalm, who were born via surrogacy.</p>
    <p>She said that while she was grateful to have a supportive partner in West, parenting was still hard.</p>
    <p>"I think parenting is hard no matter what. It's a different experience for everyone, and you just do the best you can."</p>
    <p>But Kardashian's honesty and vulnerability on the topic have struck a chord with many parents who struggle with the same anxiety and challenges.</p>

   <section id="examples">
    
    <p>Kardashian's comments reflect the reality of parenting in the modern age, where social media and constant connectivity can increase anxiety and pressure on parents.</p>
    <p>A survey conducted by the American Psychological Association found that 59% of parents reported feeling stressed by social media, with concerns about their children's safety and their own parenting abilities topping the list of worries.</p>
    <p>Other research has found that parents who use social media more frequently are more likely to experience symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress.</p>
    <p>On top of this, parents today are often juggling work, childcare, and household responsibilities, with little support or time for themselves.</p>
    <p>A study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that working mothers spend an average of 3.3 hours per day on household activities and caring for children, while working fathers spend just 1.8 hours per day on these tasks.</p>
    <p>These quantifiable examples show that Kardashian's struggles are not unique, and that many parents are facing similar challenges in their daily lives.</p>

    <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
    <p>If you're a parent struggling with anxiety and stress, there are some practical steps you can take to help ease the burden:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Take a break from social media: Try setting aside specific times to check your phone or computer, and limit your exposure to negative or triggering content.</li>
     <li>Practice self-care: Make time for yourself each day, whether it's a few minutes of meditation, a hot bath, or a walk outside.</li>
     <li>Seek support: Talk to a trusted friend or family member about your struggles, or consider seeing a therapist or counselor who can offer additional guidance and support.</li>
     <li>Set realistic expectations: Remember that no parent is perfect, and it's okay to make mistakes or ask for help when needed.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>By taking these steps, you can help alleviate some of the pressure and stress that come with parenting, and find more joy and fulfillment in your role as a caregiver.</p>
