    <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
    <p>One example of Nvidia's technology in action is in the field of drug discovery. Traditional drug discovery can take years and cost billions of dollars, but with the help of AI technology, researchers can accelerate the process and reduce costs.</p>
    <p>In a recent case study, researchers at Insilico Medicine used Nvidia's GPUs to generate potential drug molecules in just 21 days. The traditional method would have taken months, if not years, to complete. The researchers were able to identify two promising drug candidates that are now being tested in clinical trials.</p>
    <p>This is just one example of how AI technology is transforming the field of drug discovery, and Nvidia's technology is playing a key role.</p>
