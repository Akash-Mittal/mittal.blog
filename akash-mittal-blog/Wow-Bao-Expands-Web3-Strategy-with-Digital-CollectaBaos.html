  <p>Once upon a time, Wow Bao, a fast casual restaurant specializing in Asian steamed buns, faced a problem. Their customer base, which was primarily composed of tech-savvy millennials, preferred to use their smartphones for everything. They wanted their experience at Wow Bao to be fast and convenient.
