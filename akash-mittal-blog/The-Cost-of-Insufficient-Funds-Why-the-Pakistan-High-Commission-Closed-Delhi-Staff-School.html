  <p>Have you ever had to scramble to cover a bill because your account balance was too low? It's a stressful experience that happens to many people from time to time. But imagine if you owned a school and couldn't pay your teachers because there wasn't enough money in the bank. That's exactly what happened at the Pakistan High Commission's staff school in Delhi, and the consequences were devastating.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The staff school was established to educate the children of Pakistan High Commission officials serving in India. It was run as a non-profit organization and relied on fees collected from parents to cover its expenses. However, due to a lack of proper financial management, the school ran into serious financial trouble.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The first sign of trouble came in February 2019, when some teachers went on strike because they hadn't been paid. The school's management blamed insufficient funds for the delay in payment, and promised to resolve the issue soon. Unfortunately, the situation only got worse.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In July 2019, the school had to shut down because it couldn't pay its staff. The management announced that the school would remain closed until further notice, leaving hundreds of students without access to education. The closure was a big blow to the children, their families, and the Pakistani community in Delhi.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The incident at the staff school is a cautionary tale about the importance of financial management. It shows that even non-profit organizations can't operate on goodwill alone. They need to have sound financial practices in place to ensure that they can fulfill their mission.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Some quantifiable examples of the costs of insufficient funds may include:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>- Late fees, overdraft charges, and high interest rates on credit cards and loans.</p>
  <p>- Negative impacts on credit scores and the ability to qualify for future loans and credit.</p>
  <p>- Missed opportunities to invest and grow wealth due to lack of funds.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>To prevent similar situations, organizations should prioritize financial management and establish systems to track income and expenses, develop budgets and forecasts, and regularly review performance. Additionally, they should consider seeking expert advice and training to improve their financial literacy and management skills.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, the Pakistan High Commission's decision to close its staff school in Delhi due to insufficient funds highlights the critical importance of financial management. Non-profit organizations, just like for-profit businesses, must take steps to manage their funds properly to avoid negative consequences. By prioritizing financial management, organizations can fulfill their mission and serve their communities effectively.</p>
