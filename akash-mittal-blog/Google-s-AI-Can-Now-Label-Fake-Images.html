   <p>Have you ever come across a dubious image on social media that you weren't quite sure was real or not? You're not alone. With the rise of deepfake technology, it's becoming increasingly difficult to differentiate between real and fake images. But with the help of Google's latest artificial intelligence (AI) technology, that may no longer be an issue.</p>
   <h2>How Google's AI Works</h2>
   <p>Google's AI technology uses a method called "two-stream inception" that analyzes images in two ways: spatially and temporally. Spatial analysis means the AI looks at the individual pixels of an image to identify patterns and subtle inconsistencies. Temporal analysis means the AI looks at how the image changes over time to determine if it's authentic or not.</p>
   <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
   <p>This AI technology has a wide range of applications in today's society. For example, it could be used to identify fake images created by political campaigns to sway voters, or to protect celebrities from fake images that could be used to slander or defame them. In addition, it could be used by news organizations to verify the authenticity of user-generated content submitted by viewers.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Google's AI technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about visual media.</li>
    <li>It has real-world applications in fields such as politics, entertainment, and journalism.</li>
    <li>While there are concerns about the ethics of this kind of surveillance, it's clear that this technology will become an essential tool in our daily lives.</li>
