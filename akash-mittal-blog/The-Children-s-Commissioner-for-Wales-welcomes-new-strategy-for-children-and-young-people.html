  <h1>The Children's Commissioner for Wales welcomes new strategy for children and young people</h1> <img src="images/The-Children-s-Commissioner-for-Wales-welcomes-new-strategy-for-children-and-young-people.jpeg" alt="+The-Children-s-Commissioner-for-Wales-welcomes-new-strategy-for-children-and-young-people+">
  <p>Once upon a time, there was a group of children who were often forgotten in policymaking and decision-making processes. These children were from deprived backgrounds, lived in vulnerable circumstances, or had disabilities or special needs. They felt that their voices were not being heard, and no one was advocating for their rights and welfare. Until one day, a new strategy was launched that aimed to put children and young people at the center of policy development and implementation. The Children's Commissioner for Wales welcomed this strategy with open arms, as it provided hope and opportunity for these marginalized children.</p>
  <h2>The new strategy</h2>
  <p>The new strategy for children and young people in Wales is called "Prosperity for All: A National Strategy". Its goal is to create a more equal Wales, where everyone can prosper, regardless of their background or circumstances. The strategy has four priority areas:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Healthy, active, and informed individuals and families</li>
   <li>Thriving and innovative communities and localities</li>
   <li>Prosperous and secure economy</li>
   <li>United and connected Wales</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each priority area has specific objectives and actions, which provide a roadmap for achieving a better future for Welsh children and young people.</p>
  <h2>Quantifiable examples</h2>
  <p>The new strategy is not just a list of wishes and aspirations, but it has measurable targets that can be tracked and evaluated. For example, in the priority area of healthy, active, and informed individuals and families, the strategy aims to:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Reduce the percentage of children living in poverty from 29% to 10% by 2030</li>
   <li>Increase the percentage of pupils achieving Level 2+ in the Core Subject Indicator (CSI) at Key Stage 4 from 63.8% in 2016 to 80% by 2025</li>
   <li>Improve access to mental health support for children and young people</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These targets are ambitious, but they are necessary to ensure that Welsh children and young people have the best possible start in life.</p>
