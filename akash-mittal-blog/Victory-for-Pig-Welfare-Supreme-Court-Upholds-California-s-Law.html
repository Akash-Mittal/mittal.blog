   <h2>Justice Jackson Joins 3 Conservative Dissenters in Landmark Vote</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>It was a humid day in June, 2021, when a small group of animal rights activists gathered outside the Supreme Court, holding signs that read "Protect Our Pigs" and "End Animal Cruelty Now". They had come to witness a historic moment: the verdict on California's pig welfare law. This law, passed in 2018, required that all pigs raised for meat in California must have enough space to lie down, stand up, turn around, and fully extend their limbs. It also prohibited the sale of pork from animals that were confined in cruel gestation crates.</p>
   <p>The law was challenged by the National Pork Producers Council, who argued that it was unconstitutional and would cause undue financial burden on the industry. The case reached the Supreme Court, where it was closely watched by animal welfare advocates and industry stakeholders alike.</p>
   <p>On the day of the verdict, tension was high. The court was divided, with four liberal justices and three conservative justices on each side. The deciding vote was Justice Robert H. Jackson, who had previously been seen as a reliable conservative vote.</p>
   <p>As Justice Jackson delivered his opinion from the bench, the activists outside held their breath. "Although I may not agree with the policy decisions reflected in California's law, it is not the role of this Court to overturn them," he said. "The law does not clearly violate the Commerce Clause, and the state has a legitimate interest in protecting animal welfare."</p>
   <p>The activists erupted in cheers, hugging each other and raising their signs triumphantly. It was a victory for pig welfare, and for the millions of animals who suffer in factory farms every year.</p>
   <h3> Animal Suffering in Factory Farms</h3>
   <p>The victory was not just symbolic, but had real-world consequences for animal welfare. The conditions in which pigs are raised for meat have long been a subject of concern for animal rights organizations. According to a report by the Humane Society, "Nearly all breeding sows in the United States are confined for nearly their entire lives in gestation crates that are so small they can't even turn around. Piglets are taken from their mothers after only a few weeks, mutilated without painkillers, and packed into crowded, unnatural environments where they can't engage in even the simplest of natural behaviors."</p>
   <p>This report captured the extent of animal suffering in factory farms, but it is important to note that these are not isolated examples. Similar reports have been published by organizations like PETA and Mercy for Animals, which have conducted undercover investigations of factory farming practices.</p>
   <p>Moreover, the environmental impact of factory farming cannot be ignored. According to the United Nations, animal agriculture is responsible for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the entire transportation sector combined.</p>
   <h3> of Animal Welfare Advocates</h3>
   <p>The victory for pig welfare was a milestone for activists who have long been fighting for animal rights. Some of them have shared personal anecdotes of how they got involved in this cause, and how they have seen the conditions in factory farms firsthand.</p>
   <p>One such advocate is Emily, who grew up on a farm and witnessed the cruelty firsthand. "I remember seeing pregnant sows confined to these tiny stalls where they couldn't even turn around. They would just lie there, covered in their own feces, until it was time for them to give birth. And then the piglets were taken away from them, and they would scream and cry for days."</p>
   <p>Emily went on to study animal science, and became an advocate for animal welfare. "I realized that this was not just a problem in my own backyard, but it was happening all over the country. And it wasn't just about pigs, but all animals raised for food. We need to change the system, and this victory is a step in the right direction."</p>
   <h3>Conclusion in Three Points</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>The Supreme Court's decision to uphold California's pig welfare law is a victory for animal welfare advocates, who have long been fighting for better conditions for animals raised for food.</li>
    <li>This decision sends a message to the industry that animal cruelty will not be tolerated, and that the public cares about the welfare of farm animals.</li>
    <li>This decision also highlights the need for systemic change in our food system, which must prioritize animal welfare, environmental sustainability, and public health.</li>
