  <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
  <p>I know someone who works in a defense manufacturing company in India. According to him, safety protocols are taken very seriously at the company. Every employee is trained extensively in the handling of dangerous materials and equipment. However, incidents like the BrahMos missile firing show that there is always room for improvement.</p>
  <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
  <p>If you're interested in a career in defense manufacturing, be prepared to receive extensive training in safety protocols. Make sure you're comfortable working with dangerous materials and equipment. And always remember that safety should be your top priority.</p>
