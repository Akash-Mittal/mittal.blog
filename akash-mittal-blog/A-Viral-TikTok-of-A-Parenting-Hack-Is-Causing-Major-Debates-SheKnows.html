  <p>As parents, we all know the struggles of trying to keep our kids entertained and engaged, especially during a pandemic when outdoor activities may be limited. One viral TikTok video is causing major debates among parents about whether or not it's an acceptable parenting hack.</p>
  <p>The video shows a mother taking a tablet and taping it to the ceiling with duct tape to keep her baby entertained while she gets ready for the day. The post has over 10 million views and countless comments from parents on both sides of the argument.</p>
  <h2>The Argument for the Parenting Hack</h2>
  <p>Those in favor of the parenting hack argue that it's a great way to keep kids entertained while still being able to get things done around the house. Parents who have tried it note that it's great for keeping kids calm during car rides or doctor's appointments. One father even commented that he used the hack during a flight and his toddler was entertained for the entire trip.</p>
  <p>It's also a great way to keep kids engaged in educational or developmental videos. One mother notes that she tapes an educational video to the ceiling during her child's nap time to help with language development. Others have used it to help with potty training, taping a video to the ceiling to help keep their child occupied while sitting on the toilet.</p>
  <h2>The Argument against the Parenting Hack</h2>
  <p>On the other side of the argument, many parents feel that the parenting hack is dangerous and could potentially harm their child. Some worry about the tablet falling and injuring the child, while others worry about the effects of too much screen time on their child's development.</p>
  <p>One child development expert notes that young children should have limited screen time and that the use of screens should always be intentional, rather than simply a means to keep kids entertained. They also argue that too much screen time can be detrimental to children's social and emotional development.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>While the parenting hack may be useful in certain situations, it's important to consider the potential risks and drawbacks. As parents, we have to weigh the benefits of keeping our kids entertained against the risks of exposing them to too much screen time or potential harm.</li>
   <li>If you do decide to try the parenting hack, make sure to use proper safety measures like securing the tablet securely. It's also important to limit screen time and make sure that the content is educational and developmentally appropriate.</li>
   <li>Ultimately, every parent has to make their own decision about what's best for their child. The most important thing is to be intentional and thoughtful about how we use screens and technology in our parenting.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>As a mother of two young children, I can understand both sides of the argument. There have been times when I've resorted to using the tablet to keep my kids entertained while I get things done around the house. However, I do worry about the potential risks and try to limit their screen time as much as possible.</p>
  <p>One practical tip that has worked for me is to set specific times for screen time, rather than relying on it as a constant source of entertainment. For example, I'll let my kids have 30 minutes of tablet time while I cook dinner. This way, they still get some screen time, but it's limited and intentional.</p>
