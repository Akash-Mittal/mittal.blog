   <h3>An Interview with a High School Teacher</h3>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>I recently chatted with Mrs. K, a high school teacher in Hawai'i, about ChatGPT, a website that uses AI to generate conversational responses. Mrs. K expressed her concerns about ChatGPT's impact on her students' social skills and ability to think critically. I asked Mrs. K what her school was doing about ChatGPT, and here's what she had to say:</p>
   <blockquote>
    "Our school has implemented a few strategies to address the issue of ChatGPT. First, we've created lessons that teach students how to recognize when they're talking with an AI program versus a human. This helps them to be more mindful of the limitations of AI and to critically evaluate its responses. Second, we've encouraged our students to engage in more face-to-face communication with their peers and teachers. This helps to develop their social skills and emotional intelligence. Lastly, we've emphasized the importance of using technology in moderation and balancing it with other activities, such as reading, exercise, and creative pursuits."
   </blockquote>
   <p>While these strategies are helpful, it's important to note that not all schools are taking action against ChatGPT. Some educators see ChatGPT as a useful tool for language learning and cultural exchange. Others believe that their role is to prepare students for a world where AI is increasingly prevalent and that exposing them to ChatGPT can help them to better understand and navigate this world.</p>
   <p>However, Mrs. K argues that schools have a responsibility to prepare students for more than just practical skills; they must also foster their social and emotional growth. "We need to teach our students how to relate to each other as humans, not just as machines," she asserts. "That requires face-to-face communication, empathy, and critical thinking skills that can't be replicated by an algorithm."</p>
   <p>So, what can parents and students do to minimize the potentially negative effects of ChatGPT? Mrs. K recommends:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Encouraging students to communicate with others in person, whether it's through sports, clubs, or other activities</li>
    <li>Encouraging students to read and engage in creative pursuits, such as art or music</li>
    <li>Limiting screen time and balancing it with other activities</li>
    <li>Discussing the limitations and potential biases of AI with their children</li>
   </ul>
   <p>While AI technologies like ChatGPT have the potential to revolutionize the way we communicate and learn, it's important to recognize their limitations and potential risks. By taking a proactive approach to technology education, schools and families can help to ensure that students are equipped with the skills they need to thrive in a rapidly changing world.</p>
