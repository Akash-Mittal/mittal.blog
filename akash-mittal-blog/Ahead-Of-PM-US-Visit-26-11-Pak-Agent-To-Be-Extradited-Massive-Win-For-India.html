    <p>It was a dark night on November 26, 2008, when Mumbai was under the attack of terrorists. The attack lasted for almost three days and left 166 people dead and many more injured. The world was in shock and India was in mourning. The terrorists were later found to be Pakistani nationals who had entered India through the sea route. India, through its intelligence agencies, had managed to gather enough evidence of Pakistani involvement in the attack. However, Pakistan, as usual, denied any such involvement.</p>
    <p>After years of diplomatic efforts, India has finally managed to extradite a Pakistani agent who was believed to be involved in the planning of the attack. This is a massive win for India ahead of the Prime Minister's visit to the United States.</p>
