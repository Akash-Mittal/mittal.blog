    <p>It was a typical Monday morning when John, the CEO of a mid-size tech company, received an email from his IT department about a new AI-powered chatbot they had developed. The chatbot, named ChatGPT, was able to understand natural language and provide intelligent responses to customer inquiries in real-time. John was intrigued by the possibilities and asked for a demo.</p>
    <p>The demo was impressive. ChatGPT was able to handle multiple conversations simultaneously and provide accurate answers in a matter of seconds.
