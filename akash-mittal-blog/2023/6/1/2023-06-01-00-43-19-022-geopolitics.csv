But to fulfill this demand, we need one crucial element- lithium. This soft, silvery-white metal is the heart of modern batteries.
However, lithium is not found everywhere, and most of it is concentrated in a few countries. The Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous region in China is one of the world's largest lithium deposits. And now, with a new investment of 2 billion dollars, the region's lithium production is about to double.
The Benchmark Mineral Intelligence producer price index for lithium carbonate has continued to rise steadily over the years, proving the significance of this investment. The index, which measures the prices of lithium carbonate, has more than quadrupled in the last four years. The 2 billion investments are set to double the lithium oxide output of the region from 45,000 tons in 2020 to 90,000 tons by 2023.
This article explores the significance of this investment, its potential impact on the world of energy, and why it matters to you.
The 2 billion investments in Xinjiang lithium are set to have a massive impact on the world's energy market. It will double the region's supply of lithium, which means more batteries can be produced. This investment will help China's EV sector lower the cost of its battery components, which will give it a competitive advantage globally. China is looking to increase sales of electric vehicles to 20% of the total by 2025, and this will give the country more resources to achieve that goal.

The investor has already invested in several other countries and is baffled by the delay caused by India's stringent policies. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated case. The Indian government is known for its strict policies, which sometimes leads to delays in foreign investments. This has left many investors, including China, Pakistan, and others, in a quandary.

The impact of the ongoing limbo on FDI permissions is immense. The Indian economy is facing a huge demand-supply gap, and the inflow of foreign investments would be a great way to bridge that gap. The Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has been working diligently to attract foreign investments, but due to the strict policies, India is losing out on millions of dollars of investments.
