  <p>India's economy grew by 6.1% in the first quarter of the fiscal year 2021-22, beating forecasts and surpassing the pre-pandemic level of GDP for the first time. The data released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation on Tuesday showed that growth was driven by the manufacturing, construction and financial sectors, as well as by a surge in consumer spending.</p>
  <h2>A Story of Recovery</h2>
  <p>India's GDP was hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic last year, contracting by a record 7.7% in the fiscal year 2020-21. The lockdowns and restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the virus severely disrupted economic activity and caused job losses and hardship for millions of people.</p>
  <p>However, as the vaccination drive picked up pace and the government eased restrictions, economic activity started to recover. The manufacturing sector, which had been severely affected by the pandemic, resumed operations and started to produce goods for both domestic and export markets. The construction sector, which had been adversely affected by the halt in construction activities, also saw a rebound in demand as people started to invest in housing and infrastructure. The financial sector, too, showed signs of recovery as credit growth and capital inflows increased.</p>
  <p>Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of India's GDP, also picked up as people started to spend on goods and services that they had put off during the pandemic. The festive season and the lifting of restrictions on travel and leisure activities further boosted consumer confidence and spending.</p>
  <p>The government's stimulus measures, including tax cuts and subsidies, also played a role in supporting the recovery. The Reserve Bank of India's accommodative monetary policy, which kept interest rates low and provided liquidity to banks, also helped to ease financial conditions and support lending.</p>
  
  <p>The 6.1% growth in India's GDP in the first quarter of 2021-22 was higher than the median estimate of 5.2% in a Reuters poll of economists. It was also higher than the 0.4% growth in the same period a year ago, when the pandemic had just hit India.</p>
  <p>The manufacturing sector grew by 49.6% in the first quarter of 2021-22, compared to a contraction of 36.2% in the same period last year. The construction sector grew by 68.3%, compared to a contraction of 49.4% last year. The financial, insurance, real estate and professional services sector grew by 7.4%, compared to a growth of 1.5% last year.</p>
  <p>Consumer spending on goods and services grew by 9.2% in the first quarter of 2021-22, compared to a contraction of 26.2% in the same period last year. Private final consumption expenditure, which measures household spending, grew by 11.3%, compared to a contraction of 29.1% last year.</p>

  <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
  <p>Deepak Rao, a small business owner in Mumbai, said that the recovery in the economy had helped him to revive his business after a difficult year.

"The government's stimulus measures and the easing of restrictions have been a big help."</p>
  <p>Rakesh Singh, a construction worker in New Delhi, said that he had seen an increase in demand for his services in recent months. "There's been a lot of construction activity in my area, and I've been getting more jobs than before," he said. "People seem to be investing in housing and infrastructure, which is good news for us."</p>
  <p>Asmita Sharma, a retail worker in Bangalore, said that she had noticed a surge in consumer spending during the festive season.
