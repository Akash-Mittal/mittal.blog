  <p>There is an interesting story of a foreign investor who submitted his proposal to invest in India in 2015, but is still waiting for the approval. The investor has already invested in several other countries and is baffled by the delay caused by India's stringent policies. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated case. The Indian government is known for its strict policies, which sometimes leads to delays in foreign investments. This has left many investors, including China, Pakistan, and others, in a quandary.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The impact of the ongoing limbo on FDI permissions is immense. The Indian economy is facing a huge demand-supply gap, and the inflow of foreign investments would be a great way to bridge that gap. The Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has been working diligently to attract foreign investments, but due to the strict policies, India is losing out on millions of dollars of investments.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>A recent study by the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) found that India was the second-most attractive destination for investments. However, the same survey showed that it was also the most difficult destination to do business. The problem areas included lack of infrastructure, complicated tax regulations, and slow government decisions. These factors have made foreign investors wary of investing in India.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The Indian government has been taking steps to simplify its policies and improve its ranking on the ease of doing business index. However, the delays caused by the stringent policies still exist. For instance, China's $100 billion investment plan in India is still in limbo due to the regulatory hurdles. Similarly, Pakistan's recent proposal to invest $2.4 billion in an oil refinery in India is also stuck in the bureaucratic process.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The Indian government and foreign investors need to work hand in hand to resolve these issues. The Indian government should introduce more liberal policies to attract foreign investments. This would not only benefit the Indian economy but would also create job opportunities for the Indian youth. Foreign investors should also be patient and work with the Indian government to overcome the bureaucratic hurdles.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>There are some quantifiable examples of how foreign investments can benefit the Indian economy. For instance, Japan's investment in India is expected to create 700,000 jobs in the next five years. Similarly, the US investment in India has already created 70,000 jobs.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, India's limbo on FDI permissions has left many foreign investors in a quandary. It is time for the Indian government to introduce more liberal policies to attract foreign investments and overcome the bureaucratic hurdles. Foreign investors should also be patient and work with the Indian government to resolve these issues. A more cooperative approach would not only benefit the Indian economy but would also create job opportunities for the Indian youth.</p>
