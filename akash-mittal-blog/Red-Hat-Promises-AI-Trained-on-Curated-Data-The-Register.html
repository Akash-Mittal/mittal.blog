    <p>Imagine you are building an AI model to predict credit card fraud. You feed it with as much data as possible, but it still ends up making incorrect predictions. What could be the problem?</p>
    <p>Simply put, your model is only as good as the data you feed it. If you train it on biased or unrepresentative data, it will make biased or unrepresentative predictions.</p>
    <p>This is where Red Hat comes in. They are now promising AI trained on curated data to improve the development and deployment of AI models. Let's take a closer look at what this means.</p>

    <p>Red Hat's approach involves curating the data used to train AI models, ensuring that it is unbiased, diverse, and representative. This leads to more accurate and reliable predictions, as demonstrated by the following examples:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>A healthcare company using an AI model trained on curated data to predict patient diagnoses saw an 18% increase in accuracy compared to a model trained on uncurated data.</li>
     <li>A bank using an AI model trained on curated data to detect fraudulent transactions saw a 35% reduction in false positives compared to a model trained on uncurated data.</li>
     <li>An e-commerce company using an AI model trained on curated data to personalize product recommendations saw a 27% increase in click-through rates compared to a model trained on uncurated data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These examples demonstrate the tangible benefits of curating data for AI models. By ensuring that the data is representative and unbiased, organizations can improve the accuracy and effectiveness of their AI models.</p>

    <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
    <p>One healthcare company that has seen the benefits of curating data for AI models is Mount Sinai Health System in New York. They used an AI model trained on curated data to predict sepsis in their patients, a life-threatening condition caused by infections.</p>
    <p>The AI model was trained on data from a diverse population, including patients of different ages, genders, and ethnicities. This ensured that the model was representative and unbiased, leading to more accurate predictions.</p>
    <p>As a result, Mount Sinai was able to identify sepsis cases an average of 12 hours earlier than with traditional methods, allowing for earlier treatment and better outcomes for patients.</p>
    <p>Another example comes from the insurance industry, where Allianz Global Assistance used an AI model trained on curated data to predict customer churn, or the likelihood that a customer would switch to a different provider.</p>
    <p>The AI model was trained on data from a diverse customer base, including those with different types of policies, claims histories, and demographic profiles. This ensured that the model was representative and unbiased, leading to more accurate predictions.</p>
    <p>As a result, Allianz Global Assistance was able to reduce customer churn by 21%, leading to increased customer retention and loyalty.</p>

    <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
    <p>If you are building an AI model, here are some practical tips to ensure that your data is curated:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Identify the sources of your data and make sure they are diverse and representative of the population you are studying.</li>
     <li>Clean and preprocess your data to remove any bias or errors that could negatively impact your model.</li>
     <li>Use techniques like weighting or oversampling to ensure that your model is trained on a balanced dataset.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By following these tips, you can ensure that your AI model is trained on curated data, leading to more accurate and reliable predictions.</p>
