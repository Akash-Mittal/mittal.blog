    <p>It was a hot summer day in Delhi, India. I was walking down the street minding my own business when suddenly I heard loud noises coming from a nearby temple. Curiosity got the better of me and I decided to investigate. To my shock, I witnessed a group of people beating up a man who looked like he belonged to a different religion. I was appalled and quickly dialed the police to report the incident. Sadly, this is not an uncommon occurrence in India where religious violence is on the rise.</p>

     <li>Religious violence in India is a serious issue that undermines social cohesion and threatens national unity.</li>
     <li>The rise in communal tensions can be attributed to political and economic factors.</li>
     <li>To tackle this problem, there needs to be a concerted effort from the government and civil society to promote inter-faith dialogue, ensure strict enforcement of the law and improve economic opportunities for all communities.</li>

    <p>When I was a child, my best friend was a Hindu and I am a Muslim. We would play together every day after school without any issues, and our families had no problems with our friendship. It was only as I grew older that I became more aware of the religious differences between us and the tensions that existed between different communities. It saddens me to see how religion is often used to divide people instead of bringing them together.</p>
