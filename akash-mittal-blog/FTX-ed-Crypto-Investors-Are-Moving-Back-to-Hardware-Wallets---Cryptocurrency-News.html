   <p>Crypto investors who were stung by the recent hack on FTX Exchange are reportedly moving back to hardware wallets, according to recent research.</p>
   <p>The hack saw millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies stolen, and has caused many investors to lose faith in online exchanges.</p>
   <p>One investor who lost their crypto in the FTX hack spoke to us about their experience: "I had all my crypto on the exchange because it was so easy to trade. But now I've lost everything and I have to start again."</p>
   <p>The investor has now decided to move their remaining crypto to a hardware wallet, which they say is much safer.</p>
   <p>Many investors have been following suit, with companies such as Ledger and Trezor reporting a surge in sales in recent weeks.</p>
   <p>Both of these companies have been in the hardware wallet business for years and are well respected in the crypto community. They offer secure, tamper-proof devices that keep investors' crypto safe from hackers.</p>
   <p>Other companies, such as ELLIPAL and KeepKey, have also seen increased sales as investors look for a safe place to store their crypto.</p>
   <p>While online exchanges can be convenient, they are also vulnerable to hacking attacks. Hardware wallets, on the other hand, are almost impossible to hack, making them the safest option for long-term storage.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, the recent hack on FTX has reminded investors of the importance of keeping their crypto safe. By moving their funds to hardware wallets, they are taking a proactive step towards securing their investments.</p>
