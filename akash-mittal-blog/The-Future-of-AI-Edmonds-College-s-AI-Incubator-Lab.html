    <h2>What is AI?</h2>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is defined as the ability of machines to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence. This includes activities such as recognizing speech, making decisions, and learning from experience.</p>
    <p>The use of AI is becoming increasingly popular in a variety of industries, including healthcare, finance, and transportation.</p>
    <p>Some examples of successful use of AI include:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Google's self-driving car</li>
     <li>Amazon's Alexa and Echo devices</li>
     <li>IBM's Watson computer system</li>
    </ul>
    <p>AI is also used in fraud detection, facial recognition, and natural language processing.</p>
