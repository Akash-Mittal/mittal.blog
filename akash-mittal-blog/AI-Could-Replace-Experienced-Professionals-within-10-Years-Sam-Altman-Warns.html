    <p>Imagine a world where robots run hospitals, accountants are replaced by algorithms, and engineering jobs are manned by machines. This may seem like something out of a sci-fi movie, but according to Sam Altman, it could become a reality in the next decade.</p>

    <p>Already, we are seeing the effects of AI on certain industries. For example:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Many retail stores are using self-checkout machines instead of human cashiers.</li>
     <li>Some law firms are using AI technology to search through legal documents instead of paralegals.</li>
     <li>Doctors are using AI to assist them with diagnoses and treatment recommendations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are just a few examples, but they demonstrate how AI is already changing the job market. As AI technology becomes more advanced, it will be able to replace more and more jobs that were previously thought to be safe from automation.</p>
