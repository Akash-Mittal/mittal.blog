   <h2>An Analysis of the Effects of Crypto Regulation on South Korean Web3 Start-ups</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <h3>Introduction</h3>
   <p>South Korea is home to several Web3 unicorns that were once considered to be the future of the country's tech industry. However, the growth of these start-ups has been hindered by the government's strict regulations on cryptocurrency. This article discusses the impact of crypto regulation on the growth of South Korean Web3 unicorns.</p>
   <h3>The Story of dApp</h3>
   <p>dApp is a South Korean start-up that was founded in 2017. It developed a decentralized mobile app that allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrency directly from their phones. The company quickly gained popularity and became a Web3 unicorn in just two years.</p>
   <p>However, in September 2019, the South Korean regulator, the Financial Services Commission, issued a ban on all initial coin offerings (ICOs). This ban was a major blow to dApp, as it had planned to launch its own ICO to raise funds for further development.</p>
   <p>Since then, dApp has struggled to grow. The company's CEO, Lee Jang-hwan, said in an interview, "The ICO ban has severely limited our ability to raise funds, which has in turn hindered our growth."</p>
   <h3>The Impact of Crypto Regulation on Web3 Unicorns</h3>
   <p>dApp is not alone in its struggles. Many other South Korean Web3 unicorns have been affected by the country's strict regulations on cryptocurrency. For example:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Icon (ICX) - Icon is a blockchain platform that connects various independent networks. In 2018, the company raised $42 million in an ICO. However, since the ICO ban, Icon has struggled to raise funds and has seen a decline in its market value.</li>
    <li>Kakao's GroundX - GroundX is a blockchain subsidiary of South Korean tech giant, Kakao. The company's flagship project, Klaytn, is a blockchain-based platform that aims to provide easy access to blockchain technology for businesses. However, Klaytn has faced regulatory hurdles and has been forced to delay its launch.</li>
    <li>Hashed - Hashed is a blockchain-focused venture capital firm that has invested in several South Korean Web3 start-ups. The company's founder, Simon Kim, has warned that the strict regulations in South Korea are causing the country to fall behind in the global blockchain race.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Conclusion</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>The strict regulations on cryptocurrency in South Korea have hindered the growth of Web3 start-ups in the country.</li>
    <li>These regulations have limited the ability of these companies to raise funds, which has in turn hindered their growth.</li>
    <li>To stay competitive in the global blockchain race, South Korea needs to revisit its crypto regulations and provide a more supportive environment for Web3 start-ups.</li>
   </ol>
