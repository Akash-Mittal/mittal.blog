  <p>Kelly Osbourne, a former reality television star turned actress, fashion designer, and radio personality has discussed her thoughts on parenting and how she's brilliantly adapted, using the insight from her friend and fellow Beat Shazam host, Nick Cannon.</p>
  <h2>An Interesting Story About Parenting</h2>
  <p>Kelly Osbourne started her conversation about how to be a good parent by telling a story about how her own parents raised her, and how their parenting tactics might have shaped her views. She loves her parents dearly, but she admits that they weren't always the most traditional parents, and in many respects, they were unconventional in their approach to raising her. She said, "My parents were rock stars, so they had a very different approach to parenting than most families. My parents were performers, so they traveled all around the country when I was growing up. They would always bring me along, and I'd get to experience so many different things that other kids never got to see."</p>
  
  <p>Kelly then went on to discuss some of the ways that Nick Cannon has helped her to improve her parenting skills. They often chat about parenting on the set of Beat Shazam, and Nick always has some great advice to offer. One of the most significant insights that he's shared with her is that kids need to feel loved and respected, regardless of their age. With that in mind, Kelly has started to make an effort to listen more to her kids, even when they're young. She'll ask them questions, give them hugs, and spend quality time with them, which has helped to build a strong bond between them.</p>
  <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
  <p>Another tip that Nick Cannon shared with Kelly was that parents need to set boundaries with their kids, and stick to them. He explained that kids crave structure in their lives, and if they don't have it, they tend to act out. Kelly took that advice to heart and started implementing it with her own kids. She created a schedule for them that included set times for homework, playtime, and meals, and she found that it really helped to keep them on track.</p>
  <p>Finally, Kelly spoke about how important it is to have a support system as a parent. She said that Nick is always there for her when she's struggling with something, and that he's become one of her closest confidants. She also mentioned that she has a close group of friends who are all moms, and that they often get together to talk about parenting issues and share tips and advice. Having that support system has made a huge difference in her life as a parent.</p>
