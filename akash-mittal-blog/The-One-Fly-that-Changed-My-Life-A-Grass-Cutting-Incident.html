    <p>It was a beautiful summer day, and I had decided to do some yard work. As I was cutting the grass, I noticed a small fly buzzing around me. At first, I thought nothing of it and continued with my work.</p>
    <p>But as I continued to cut the grass, the fly became more persistent. It kept buzzing around me, and I began to feel annoyed. I tried to shoo it away, but it kept coming back.</p>
    <p>Finally, I decided to take a break and go inside. As I was washing my hands, I noticed a red mark on my arm. It was a small bite mark from the fly.</p>
    <p>What I didn't know at the time was that this one fly was about to change my life.</p>
