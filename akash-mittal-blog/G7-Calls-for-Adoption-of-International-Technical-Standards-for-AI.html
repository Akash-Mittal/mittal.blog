   <p>Imagine a world where robots perform surgery, cars drive themselves, and planes fly without human pilots. This is not a scene from a science fiction movie, it is the reality we are facing with the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p>
   <p>However, with such advancement come many challenges and risks. AI systems can make errors, lose control, or be hacked into by cybercriminals. To prevent such risks, the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations has called for the adoption of international technical standards for AI.</p>
   
   <ul>
    <li>AI-powered chatbots have replaced 29% of customer service agents in the banking industry, saving $1 billion annually in the US alone.</li>
    <li>AI-powered predictive maintenance has reduced unplanned downtime by 30% in the manufacturing industry, saving $10 billion annually.</li>
    <li>AI-powered medical diagnosis has improved accuracy by 30% in breast cancer detection, reducing unnecessary biopsies by 20%.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Why International Technical Standards for AI?</h2>
   <p>International technical standards for AI would ensure that AI systems are designed to be safe, trustworthy, transparent, and ethically aligned. They would also help to prevent biases and discrimination in AI decision-making. Moreover, international standards would facilitate the global adoption of AI and promote innovation in this field.</p>
   <p>However, developing such standards is not an easy task. It requires the collaboration of experts from different fields, including computer science, ethics, law, economics, and social sciences. The G7 has therefore called for the establishment of a global multistakeholder mechanism to develop and implement such standards.</p>
   <h2>The Three Points of Conclusion</h2>
   <section>
    <h3>Point One: Regulation of AI</h3>
    <p>AI must be regulated to ensure its ethical, legal, and social implications are considered, says the G7. Companies using AI must also have processes in place to stabilize, test, and monitor these algorithms.</p>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h3>Point Two: Ethical Development of AI</h3>
    <p>G7 has put forth its proposal in such a way that ethical considerations of AI technology can be taken care of in the design process. It has also identified key focus areas such as self-learning, safety, and fairness that AI should be rooted on.</p>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h3>Point Three: AI Security</h3>
    <p>The introduction of AI has widened the scope of cyberattack. It has become imperative to enhance security systems to protect AI applications.</p>
   </section>
   <p>In conclusion, the adoption of international technical standards for AI would be critical to maximizing the benefits of this technology while minimizing its risks. It would require the collaboration of governments, industry, academia, civil society, and other stakeholders to develop and implement such standards. The G7 has taken the first step by calling for such standards. It is now up to the global community to take action.</p>
