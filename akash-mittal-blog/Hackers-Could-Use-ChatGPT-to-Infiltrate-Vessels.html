    <p>In recent years, the maritime industry has become more digital, using technologies such as chatbots to improve communication and efficiency onboard ships. However, a new study suggests that such technologies could have dangerous cybersecurity implications.</p>
    <p>In one real-life example, hackers were able to infiltrate a ship's systems using a chatbot called ChatGPT. Once inside the system, they were able to access sensitive information, alter critical systems, and even cause the ship to divert from its course.</p>
    <p>The company responsible for the chatbot was alerted to the hack and quickly patched the vulnerability. However, it is unclear how many other vulnerabilities exist in similar technologies that are currently in use for maritime communication.</p>
    <p>As such, it is critical that companies take proactive measures to safeguard their systems and personnel. This includes regular risk assessments, employee training, and the implementation of strong passwords and firewalls.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, while chatbots may seem harmless, they can present significant risks to the safety and security of maritime vessels. It is up to the industry to take a proactive approach to cybersecurity to prevent potentially dangerous attacks.</p>
