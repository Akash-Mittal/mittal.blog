   <p>Many people may think it's too late to have children in their 70s, but De Niro's experience proves otherwise. In fact, having children later in life can have its advantages. Here are some of the parenting wisdom that he has shared:</p>
   <h2>1. Time is Precious</h2>
   <p>De Niro believes that as you get older, you realize how precious time is and how important it is to spend it wisely. He advises to make the most of the time you have with your children and to be present in their lives as much as possible.</p>
   <p>One way to do this is by scheduling regular family activities that everyone can enjoy. This not only strengthens your relationship with your children but also provides them with memorable experiences that they will cherish forever.</p>
   <h2>2. Patience is Key</h2>
   <p>Having children at an older age can come with its own set of challenges, including health concerns and decreased energy levels. However, De Niro emphasizes the importance of having patience and taking care of oneself to maintain a healthy lifestyle.</p>
   <p>It is also important to remember that all children are different and have their own unique personalities and needs. Taking the time to understand your child and their behavior can make all the difference in building a strong relationship.</p>
   <h2>3. Set Boundaries</h2>
   <p>De Niro believes that it's important to set boundaries with your children from a young age. This includes establishing rules and consequences for breaking them, as well as communicating openly and effectively with your child.</p>
   <p>It is also important to set boundaries for yourself, such as taking time off for self-care and not sacrificing your own well-being for the sake of your children. By setting boundaries, you create a healthy and balanced lifestyle for both you and your children.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, Robert De Niro's parenting wisdom proves that age is just a number when it comes to raising children. By prioritizing family time and being patient and setting boundaries, you can create a strong and loving relationship with your children.</p>
