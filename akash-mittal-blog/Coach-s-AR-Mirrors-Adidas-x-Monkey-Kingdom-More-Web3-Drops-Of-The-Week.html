  <p>Web3 is on the rise and more and more companies are incorporating it into their business models. From fashion retailers to movie studios, everyone wants a piece of the Web3 pie. In this article, we take a look at some of the latest drops in the wonderful world of Web3.</p>
  <h2>Coach's AR Mirrors</h2>
  <p>If you've ever been to a clothing store, you've probably spent some time in front of a mirror trying on different outfits. But what if the mirror could show you what you would look like in different outfits without you having to actually put them on? That's exactly what Coach has done with their AR mirrors.</p>
  <p>The mirrors use augmented reality technology to superimpose different outfits on your reflection, allowing you to see what you would look like without actually having to try anything on. The mirrors also come with a touch screen that allows you to browse the entire Coach collection and select the pieces that you want to try on.</p>
  <p>This is a great example of how Web3 technology can enhance the shopping experience for customers and make it more interactive. No longer do you have to spend hours trying on different outfits - now you can see what they would look like on you in a matter of seconds.</p>
  <h2>Adidas x Monkey Kingdom</h2>
  <p>Adidas has teamed up with the popular animated movie, Monkey Kingdom, to create a limited edition collection of sneakers and apparel. But what's unique about this collaboration is that each item comes with a non-fungible token (NFT) that unlocks exclusive content from the movie.</p>
  <p>For example, if you buy a pair of the Monkey Kingdom sneakers, you'll also receive an NFT that gives you access to behind-the-scenes footage from the making of the movie. This is a great way to encourage fans to buy the products and also to reward them for their loyalty.</p>
  <p>This collaboration is a great example of how Web3 technology can be used to create a more immersive and engaging experience for customers. By adding exclusive content that can only be accessed through an NFT, Adidas has created a unique selling point for their products.</p>
