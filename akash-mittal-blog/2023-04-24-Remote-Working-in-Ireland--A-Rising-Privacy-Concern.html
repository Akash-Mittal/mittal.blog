   <p>John had been working remotely for his Dublin-based company for over a year now. He enjoyed being able to work from the comfort of his home and not having to face the daily traffic jams. However, one day, he got a call from his manager telling him that some confidential information had been leaked to a competitor, and they suspected that it might have been him. John was shocked and didn't know how his work could have been compromised. It was only then that he realized the risks and privacy concerns associated with remote working.</p>
   <h2>Concrete Examples</h2>
   <p>In recent years, remote working has become more prevalent, not just in Ireland but around the world. Many companies are offering this as an option to their employees to save on expenses and increase productivity. But along with the benefits come the challenges, particularly in terms of data privacy and security.</p>
   <p>For example, in 2019, a report by Egress Software Technologies revealed that over 25% of Irish employees had shared sensitive data outside their organizations, either intentionally or unintentionally. Remote workers were identified as one of the main culprits, as they often use their own devices and networks to access company data, making it more vulnerable to cyber-attacks.</p>
   <p>Another example is the case of a Cork-based company that suffered a data breach in 2018. The company, which had employees working remotely, had failed to secure their systems, resulting in the exposure of sensitive client information.</p>
