  <p>Web3, the next evolution of the internet that is powered by blockchain and decentralized technologies, is gaining traction among businesses and investors alike. Companies that fail to embrace this paradigm shift risk being left behind in the digital age.</p>
  <p>One of the world's leading professional services firms, Deloitte, has taken a bold step towards Web3 by announcing its plan to hire 300 new employees to bolster its blockchain and digital assets practice. This move underscores Deloitte's commitment to staying ahead of the curve in the rapidly evolving landscape of technology.</p>
  <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
  <p>Deloitte's push into Web3 is already bearing fruit, as evidenced by its successful partnership with the World Economic Forum's Presidio Principles Working Group. This collaboration resulted in the creation of a set of guidelines for the responsible use of blockchain and other digital assets. Deloitte also developed a blockchain-based voting platform that was used in the 2019 European Parliament elections.</p>
  <p>Moreover, Deloitte has been actively exploring the potential of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other Web3 applications. NFTs, which are unique digital assets that can be bought, sold, and traded like traditional assets, have exploded in popularity lately, with some fetching tens of millions of dollars at auctions.</p>
  <p>Deloitte has also been working with the Ethereum Foundation to develop use cases for Ethereum 2.0, the next major upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain. This collaboration has resulted in the creation of a blockchain-based digital identity system that could be used to verify credentials across industries such as finance, healthcare, and education.</p>
