  <p>The sound of leather-soled shoes echoed off the stone walls as Indiana Jones made his way slowly down the dimly lit corridor. He was searching for the treasure that lay hidden deep within the Temple of Doom.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>But Indy was not alone. His trusty laptop, loaded with the latest HTML5 technology, was his companion on this journey. Armed with the power of the web, he could navigate through virtual worlds faster than he ever could in the real world.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Welcome to the new Indiana Jones, where the adventure is just as thrilling, but the tools are more advanced.</p>
