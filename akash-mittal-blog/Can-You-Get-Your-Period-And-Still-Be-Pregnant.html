  <h1>Can You Get Your Period And Still Be Pregnant?</h1> <img src="images/Can-You-Get-Your-Period-And-Still-Be-Pregnant.jpeg" alt="+Can-You-Get-Your-Period-And-Still-Be-Pregnant+">
  <p>One day, Lisa woke up and realized that she was a week late on her period. She started to panic and took a pregnancy test. The result was negative, so she thought it was just a late period. However, her symptoms persisted, and she started to feel bloated, tired, and moody. She decided to take another test, but this time, the result was positive. She was pregnant!</p>
  <p>Many women wonder if it is possible to get pregnant while still having their regular periods. The answer is yes, it is possible. In fact, studies show that about 6% of pregnant women experience vaginal bleeding during their first trimester, which can be mistaken for a period.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Women Who Got Pregnant While on Their Period</h2>
  <p>Although it is rare, there are women who have gotten pregnant while on their period. Here are a few examples:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>April</strong> was on the pill and was taking it regularly. However, she had unprotected sex during her period and got pregnant. She later found out that she was taking antibiotics at the time, which interfered with the pill's effectiveness.</li>
   <li><strong>Carla</strong> has a long cycle and had sex a few days before her period. She thought she was safe because she was not ovulating, but her cycle was disrupted, and she ended up getting pregnant.</li>
   <li><strong>Emily</strong> has irregular periods and had sex when she thought she was on her period. However, she was actually ovulating, and she got pregnant.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>How Can You Tell If You're Pregnant While on Your Period?</h2>
  <p>If you experience any of the following symptoms, you may be pregnant even if you have your period:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Spotting or light bleeding</li>
   <li>Breast tenderness</li>
   <li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
   <li>Fatigue</li>
   <li>Cramping</li>
   <li>Mood swings</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you suspect that you may be pregnant, take a pregnancy test. If the test is negative, wait a few days and take another test. If you continue to experience symptoms and your test is negative, see your doctor for a blood test, which can detect pregnancy earlier than a home test.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>While it is possible to get pregnant while on your period, it is rare. However, if you experience any unusual symptoms, such as spotting or light bleeding, breast tenderness, nausea, or fatigue, you may want to take a pregnancy test.</p>
