    <h2>An Interesting Story</h2>
    <p>John was an introverted person who used to shy away from social interactions. He found it difficult to strike a conversation with new people and often felt left out in social gatherings. One day, his friend introduced him to a browser extension that had a chat sidebar called ChatGPT. Intrigued by the concept, John decided to install it.</p>
    <p>As he started using ChatGPT, he found it much easier to communicate with people online. He could find like-minded people with similar interests and got connected to social groups where he could express himself freely. Slowly and steadily, he started gaining confidence in his communication skills and felt less anxious in social situations.</p>
