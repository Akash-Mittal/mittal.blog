   <p>Video advertising, as we know it, has evolved tremendously over the years. From the early days of television commercials, we now have a plethora of online platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. Brands are making use of various strategies to attract their target audience. But, amidst all the technological advancements, there's one tool that is increasingly becoming popular - Artificial Intelligence. And, Disney and YouTube are not left behind in this race.</p>
   <h2>Disney's experiment with AI in advertising</h2>
   <p>Disney, one of the world's largest media conglomerates, has always been known for its storytelling and creative excellence. And, with AI taking over the advertising world, Disney has also jumped on the bandwagon to keep up with the times.</p>
   <p>One of Disney's most successful experiments with AI in advertising was with the movie "The Lion King." In 2019, Disney partnered with Accenture Interactive to develop an AI-powered ad insertion solution. The solution allowed Disney to create personalized ads that were tailored to the audience's interests and behavior, and thus, attract engagement and maximize ad revenue.</p>
   <p>The results were astounding. The AI-powered ads generated 14% higher click-through-rates and a 26% increase in completion rates as compared to traditional static ads.</p>
   <h2>YouTube's experiment with AI in advertising</h2>
   <p>YouTube, the world's largest video-sharing platform, has also been experimenting with AI in advertising. Google's machine learning technology, Tensorflow, has enabled YouTube to deliver hyper-personalized ads to its users.</p>
   <p>YouTube's recommendation algorithm is perhaps the most famous example of AI in advertising. The algorithm tracks a user's viewing history and recommends videos based on their interests. Similarly, YouTube's AI-powered targeting software allows brands to create ads that are not only relevant but also delivered to the right audience at the right time.</p>
   <p>YouTube also introduced an AI-powered system that automatically selects thumbnail images for videos. The system uses machine learning to analyze video content and select frames that are most likely to attract clicks. According to YouTube, this has resulted in a 30% increase in click-through rates.</p>
