    <h2>An Eye-Opening Experience</h2>
    <p>One day, I was browsing the internet when I stumbled upon an article about digital accessibility. I have to admit that, until that moment, I had never really given this issue much thought. I assumed that websites and apps were designed with everyone in mind, but I was wrong. The more I read about it, the more I realized how much the internet can exclude certain groups of people.</p>
    <p>One story, in particular, stuck with me. It was about a blind man who had always loved musicals. He was thrilled to learn that a popular Broadway show was coming to his town, so he went online to buy tickets. However, the website was not accessible to his screen reader, which made it impossible for him to complete the transaction. As a result, he had to miss out on the show that he had been looking forward to for months.</p>

    <h2>Quantifiable Examples</h2>
    <p>The story of the blind man is just one example of how digital inaccessibility can have concrete consequences. Here are a few more:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>28% of people with disabilities report having difficulty accessing the internet, compared to 10% of people without disabilities. (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-basics/">W3C</a>)</li>
     <li>In 2019, there were 2,235 web accessibility lawsuits filed in the United States. (<a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2019/12/24/the-number-of-web-accessibility-lawsuits-filed-in-2019-grew-by-9/">Digital Commerce 360</a>)</li>
     <li>By 2025, the global accessible technology market is expected to reach $31.4 billion. (<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/10/15/1929290/0/en/Global-Accessible-Technology-Market-to-Reach-USD-31-4-Billion-By-2025-Growing-with-the-CAGR-of-14-4-during-2019-to-2025.html">GlobeNewswire</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These numbers demonstrate that digital accessibility is not just a matter of social responsibility, but also of economic opportunity. By creating products and services that can be used by everyone, companies can tap into a vast and diverse customer base.</p>

    <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
    <p>So, how can you prioritize digital accessibility in your work? Here are three practical tips:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Educate yourself and your team. There are many resources available online, such as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-basics/">Web Accessibility Initiative</a>, that can help you understand the basics of digital accessibility. Make sure that everyone who works on your products or services is aware of the importance of accessibility and knows how to implement it.</li>
     <li>Involve people with disabilities in your design process. The best way to understand the needs of users with disabilities is to talk to them directly. You can recruit participants through disability advocacy groups, online forums, or user research agencies that specialize in accessibility. By involving people with disabilities in your design process, you can ensure that your products and services are truly inclusive.</li>
     <li>Use accessibility guidelines and tools. There are several sets of guidelines that can help you ensure that your products and services are accessible, such as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a>. You can also use tools such as screen readers, voice recognition software, and color contrast checkers to test your products and services for accessibility.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>To prioritize digital accessibility, we should educate ourselves and our teams, involve people with disabilities in our design process, and use accessibility guidelines and tools. By doing so, we can create a truly inclusive web that liberates everyone.</p>
