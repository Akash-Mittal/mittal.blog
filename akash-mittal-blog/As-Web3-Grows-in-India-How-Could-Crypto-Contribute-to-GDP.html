  <p>Once upon a time, there was a small village in India where people used to barter goods and services. One day, a group of entrepreneurs came to the village and introduced them to the concept of money. People were amazed by this new concept, and soon the village economy started to grow.</p>
  <p>Fast forward to the present day, and we have a new kind of money - digital money, also known as cryptocurrency. With the advent of Web3, which is a decentralized internet that is powered by blockchain technology, the use of cryptocurrency is becoming mainstream in India.</p>
  
  <p>According to a report by Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, the number of cryptocurrency users in India has grown from 2 million in 2020 to 15 million in 2021. This growth has been fueled by the country's young population, who are tech-savvy and open to new ideas.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, the market capitalization of the top cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has crossed $1 trillion in 2021, which is a clear indication that it is no longer a niche market but a mainstream asset.</p>
