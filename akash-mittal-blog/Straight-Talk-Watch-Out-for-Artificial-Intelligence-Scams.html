  <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has the power to transform our lives, but it also opens up new opportunities for scammers to prey on unsuspecting victims. As AI becomes more sophisticated, so do the methods used by scammers to deceive and defraud people.</p>
  <h2>An Interesting Story:</h2>
  <p>Imagine receiving a call from your bank telling you that your account has been frozen due to suspicious activity. The caller sounds convincing and even provides your account details, but they ask for your username and password to verify your identity. After giving out your information, you realize that you've fallen for an AI-powered scam. Your hard-earned money is now in the hands of cybercriminals.</p>
  <h2>The Scope of AI Scams:</h2>
  <p>The scale of AI scams is staggering. According to a report by NortonLifeLock, the global cost of cybercrime is expected to reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025, up from $3 trillion in 2015. AI-assisted scams, such as deepfake technology, are becoming increasingly common and difficult to detect. In 2020, the FBI received more than 2,000 complaints about deepfake scams, resulting in losses of over $29 million.</p>
