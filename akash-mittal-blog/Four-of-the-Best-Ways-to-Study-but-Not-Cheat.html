    <p>When I was in high school, I had a friend who was notorious for cheating on tests. He would always come up with elaborate ways to sneak in answers or copy off of someone else's paper. But one day, our teacher caught him in the act and he was suspended for a week. It was then that he realized that cheating wasn't worth the risk. From then on, he began to study harder and eventually ended up getting into a great college. This just goes to show that cheating may seem like a shortcut, but in the end, it can do more harm than good.</p>

     <li>On the other hand, students who study effectively are more likely to earn higher grades and improve their overall academic success (3).</li>
     <li>Students who use active studying techniques, such as creating flashcards or summarizing information in their own words, are more likely to retain information (4).</li>

    <p>When I was in college, I struggled with physics. I tried studying on my own and attending lectures, but I still couldn't grasp the material. Finally, I reached out to the professor for help and he recommended forming a study group with some classmates. At first, I was hesitant- I didn't want to come across as unintelligent or slow. But joining the study group ended up being the best decision I made. We were all in the same boat and were able to help each other understand difficult concepts. I ended up doing well on the exam and even enjoyed physics by the end of the semester!</p>
