  <h1>From Unwanted Coal to China and India: Heat Builds in Europe</h1> <img src="images/From-Unwanted-Coal-to-China-and-India-Heat-Builds-in-Europe.jpeg" alt="+From-Unwanted-Coal-to-China-and-India-Heat-Builds-in-Europe+">
  <p>Imagine standing on the shores of Rotterdam, the largest port in Europe. You watch as a ship the size of a small skyscraper is loaded up with hundreds of thousands of tons of coal. The coal is big business here, but Europe doesn't actually want it. Instead, it's being shipped off to China and India, where the demand for energy is soaring.</p>
  <p>This is the reality for Europe's coal industry, which has been struggling in recent years as the region shifts away from fossil fuels. Germany, for example, has pledged to phase out all coal-fired power plants by 2038. Other countries, such as Poland and the Czech Republic, are more reluctant to move away from coal, but they too are feeling the pressure from climate activists and changing market forces.</p>
  
  <p>Europe's coal exports to China and India have surged by 39% and 31% respectively in the first five months of 2021, according to data from Europe's top seaports. Rotterdam saw a record-high of 15.4 million tonnes of coal moving through the port in the first quarter of 2021, up 34% from the same period in 2020.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, the price of coal has been rising steadily in recent months. Australian thermal coal prices, which are a benchmark for the Asia-Pacific market, soared to a record high of $151.60 a tonne in May 2021.</p>

  <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
  <p>In the Czech Republic, there are still many people who rely on coal for their livelihoods. One such person is Jan, a coal miner who has been working in the industry for over 20 years. "Coal is my life," he says. "Without it, I don't know how I would support my family." Jan worries about what will happen to him and his colleagues if the government decides to shut down the country's coal mines. "We need a plan for the future," he says.</p>
  <p>Another case study comes from India, where the demand for energy is growing rapidly. In rural villages, many people still rely on kerosene lamps for light, which can be dangerous and expensive. The government has been working to bring electricity to these areas, but the challenge is immense. One solution has been to install solar panels in remote villages, providing clean and renewable energy to people who might otherwise be left in the dark.</p>
  <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
  <p>If you're concerned about climate change and want to make a difference, there are many things you can do. Here are a few practical tips:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Reduce your energy consumption by turning off lights and appliances when you're not using them.</li>
   <li>Use public transportation, carpool, or walk instead of driving alone.</li>
   <li>Invest in renewable energy, such as solar panels or wind turbines, if it's feasible for you.</li>
  </ul>
