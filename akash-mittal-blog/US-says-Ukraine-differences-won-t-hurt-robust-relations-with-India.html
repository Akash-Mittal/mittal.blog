   <h3>An interesting story</h3>
   <p>Back in 2019, the United States made a big announcement that they were planning to impose sanctions on Turkey for buying a Russian missile defense system. India, who was also considering buying the same Russian defense system, was caught in a diplomatic dilemma. On one hand, India has been strengthening its ties with Russia, but on the other hand, it has a strategic partnership with the United States. India ultimately decided to purchase the Russian defense system, but it came at the cost of damaging its relations with the US.</p>

   <p>Despite these differences between countries, the United States has assured that it will not affect its robust relations with India. The US has been working closely with India on various fronts such as defense, trade, and technology. The US sees India as a key partner in the Indo-Pacific region, and both countries have been collaborating to maintain regional peace and stability.</p>
   <h2>Quantifiable examples</h2>
   <p>One of the biggest examples of the growing relationship between the two countries is the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF), which was established in 2017. USISPF is a non-profit advocacy organization that aims to strengthen the economic and strategic ties between the US and India. It consists of prominent members from the business community, and it has been instrumental in promoting trade and investment between both countries. In 2020, USISPF estimated that the US-India bilateral trade could touch $500 billion in the next few years if both countries continue to work together.</p>
   <p>Another example is the increasing cooperation between both countries in the defense sector. In 2020, the US and India conducted their first-ever joint military exercise in the Indian Ocean. The exercise, called Tiger Triumph, involved over 1,200 personnel from both countries and was aimed at increasing interoperability and coordination between the two militaries. Furthermore, India has also been purchasing military equipment from the US, including Apache helicopters and P-8I maritime surveillance aircraft.</p>
