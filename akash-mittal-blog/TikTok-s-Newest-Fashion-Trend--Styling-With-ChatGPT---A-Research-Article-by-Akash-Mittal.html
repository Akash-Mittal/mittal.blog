    <h2>The Rise of ChatGPT on TikTok</h2>
    <p>Have you ever heard of ChatGPT? It is an artificial intelligence platform that allows users to have realistic conversations with AI chatbots. While ChatGPT has been around for a while, it has recently gained popularity on TikTok as a tool for fashion styling.</p>
    <p>Users have been using ChatGPT to generate outfit suggestions, nail designs, and even home decor ideas. The way it works is simple - you start a conversation with the AI bot and provide it with details about your preferences such as colors, styles, and occasions, and it generates outfits for you to try on and recreate.</p>
    <blockquote>
