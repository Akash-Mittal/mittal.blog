     <h2>The Interesting Story</h2>
     <p>In June 2021, Chinese astronauts successfully launched into space as part of China's latest space mission. This marks their first manned spaceflight in almost five years and is a significant accomplishment for China's space exploration program.</p>
     <p>What makes this mission even more interesting is that it is part of China's larger goal to establish a space station in the next few years. This would make China the only country, aside from the United States and Russia, to have a permanent presence in space. The race for innovation and technology in space exploration is certainly alive and well, and China is quickly making strides towards the forefront of this race.</p>

     <h2>Three Point Conclusion</h2>
     <ol>
      <li>China is quickly becoming a leader in space exploration and innovation. Their recent mission to send astronauts into space is just one example of their success.</li>
      <li>The establishment of a space station would put China on the cutting edge of space technology and allow them to achieve new heights (literally and figuratively) in research and development.</li>
      <li>As China continues to advance its space program, it is important for other countries to keep pace and continue their own space research. The benefits of space exploration are numerous, both in terms of scientific discoveries and technological advancements.</li>
