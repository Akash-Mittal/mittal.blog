   <p>An Eye-Opening Story</p>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>As a student myself, I was excited to try out ChatGPT, the latest AI chatbot that promises to cater to all your academic needs. I had heard so much about it from my peers and decided to give it a try.</p>
   <p>One evening, when I was behind on my assignments and had an upcoming exam the next day, I decided to ask ChatGPT for help. I typed in my question and waited for a response. ChatGPT quickly replied with the answer, and I thought to myself, "this is amazing!"</p>
   <p>Feeling confident, I continued asking for answers to all my homework questions. However, I soon started to realize that I was not learning anything. ChatGPT was providing me with the correct answers, but I didn't understand how to solve the problems myself. I had become dependent on the chatbot to answer all my questions.</p>
   <p>After receiving a disappointing grade on my exam, I knew I had to change my approach to studying. I realized that I had been using ChatGPT incorrectly and had to learn how to use it effectively. Here are some of the ways I learned not to use ChatGPT:</p>
   
   <ol>
    <li>Dependence on ChatGPT leads to poor grades</li>
    <li>Using ChatGPT for all answers provides no room for learning</li>
    <li>Repetitive use of ChatGPT leads to a lack of understanding</li>
   </ol>
   <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
   <p>I spoke with several of my peers who had experienced similar issues with ChatGPT. They would ask for answers to all their questions instead of attempting to solve them on their own. As a result, they were receiving poor grades and struggling to retain information for future exams.</p>
   <p>In contrast, one student described how he used ChatGPT as a tool to complement his learning process. He would attempt the questions on his own first before referring to ChatGPT for assistance. If he got stuck on a particular problem, he would ask ChatGPT for guidance on how to solve it. This method helped him understand the concepts better and ultimately led to better grades.</p>
   <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
   <p>Based on my experience and that of my peers, here are some practical tips for using ChatGPT effectively:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Use ChatGPT as a tool to complement your learning process, not as a crutch for doing all your work.</li>
    <li>Attempt to solve problems on your own first before asking for assistance from ChatGPT.</li>
    <li>Ask ChatGPT for guidance on how to solve a problem instead of the answer itself. This will help you understand the concepts better.</li>
    <li>Once you have received assistance from ChatGPT, attempt the problem again. This will help reinforce what you have learned.</li>
    <li>Don't rely solely on ChatGPT for all your academic needs. Use other resources such as textbooks, professors, and study groups to supplement your learning.</li>
   </ul>
