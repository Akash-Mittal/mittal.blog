    <h2 id="story">Story</h2>
    <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has proposed new crypto regulations to protect investors and combat fraudulent activities in the cryptocurrency industry. The proposed regulations are aimed at addressing the dysfunction currently present in the industry and includes measures such as mandatory licenses for cryptocurrency businesses and stricter rules for digital asset exchanges.</p>
    <p>"The recent Bitfinex and Tether scandal highlight the urgent need for stronger regulation in the cryptocurrency industry," said James in a statement. "We need to protect consumers and investors while allowing for innovation and growth."</p>
    <h2 id="examples">Real-Life Examples</h2>
    <p>The proposed regulations come in the wake of several high-profile crypto scams and scandals, including the 2018 Bitconnect Ponzi scheme and the 2019 collapse of Canadian cryptocurrency exchange, QuadrigaCX. Both incidents resulted in millions of dollars in losses for investors.</p>
    <p>Another example is the case of the infamous Mt. Gox exchange, which filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after losing hundreds of thousands of bitcoins due to hacking. The incident is considered one of the largest cryptocurrency thefts in history.</p>
