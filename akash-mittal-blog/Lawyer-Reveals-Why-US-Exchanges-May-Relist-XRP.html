  <h1>Lawyer Reveals Why US Exchanges May Relist XRP</h1> <img src="images/Lawyer-Reveals-Why-US-Exchanges-May-Relist-XRP.jpeg" alt="+Lawyer-Reveals-Why-US-Exchanges-May-Relist-XRP+">
  <p>Do you know what happened with XRP? XRP, the digital currency associated with Ripple, was delisted from major US exchanges in December 2020 after the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs, alleging that XRP was an unregistered security.</p>
  <p>The news shocked the crypto market and led to a sharp decline in the value of XRP. Nevertheless, some experts believe that US exchanges may relist XRP soon. One of these experts is John Deaton, a lawyer who has been fighting for XRP's reinstatement on behalf of XRP investors.</p>
  <h2>Why US exchanges may relist XRP, according to John Deaton</h2>
  <p>John Deaton argues that US exchanges may relist XRP for several reasons:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>SEC's lawsuit is not strong enough</strong>: In Deaton's view, the SEC has a weak case against Ripple and XRP. "The SEC's lawsuit is based on an outdated and disproven legal theory that XRP is a security," Deaton said in a recent interview with Crypto Eri. "The SEC is trying to apply the Howey test, which is a test that was developed in the 1940s, to a digital asset that was created in 2013."</li>
   <li><strong>XRP has utility</strong>: XRP is not just a digital asset, but also a payment protocol that has been used by financial institutions and companies worldwide. Deaton argues that XRP's utility makes it more like a currency than a security. "XRP has a real-world use case," Deaton said. "There are over 200 companies that are building on the XRP ledger, and there are billions of dollars worth of XRP being traded every day."</li>
   <li><strong>Ripple is willing to settle with the SEC</strong>: Ripple has expressed its willingness to settle with the SEC and pay a fine if necessary. According to Deaton, this shows that Ripple is confident in its position and that the SEC's case is not as strong as they claim. "Ripple has a strong legal team and a lot of resources," Deaton said. "If they were really worried about the SEC's case, they wouldn't be willing to settle."</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Based on these arguments, Deaton believes that US exchanges may relist XRP soon, and that XRP investors may see a significant increase in the value of their holdings once the relisting happens.</p><img src="https://coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/XRP-coingape.jpg" alt="XRP">
  <h2>Examples of XRP relief efforts by XRP investors and supporters</h2>
  <p>Deaton is not the only one fighting for XRP's reinstatement. XRP investors and supporters have launched several relief efforts, including:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>XRP Community Fund</strong>: A fund that aims to provide financial support to Ripple and XRP's legal team in its fight against the SEC.</li>
   <li><strong>XMRLegal Fund</strong>: A fund that aims to provide financial support to XRP investors who have been affected by the SEC's lawsuit.</li>
   <li><strong>Boycott SEC-registered stocks</strong>: A campaign that urges XRP investors to boycott stocks that are registered with the SEC, in order to show the regulator that its actions have real-world consequences.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These relief efforts have gained traction among the XRP community, and demonstrate the level of support that XRP has among its users and investors.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>The reason why US exchanges may relist XRP soon is that the SEC's lawsuit is not strong enough, XRP has utility, and Ripple is willing to settle with the SEC.</li>
   <li>XRP investors and supporters have launched several relief efforts to help XRP's reinstatement and show their support.</li>
   <li>If XRP is relisted on major US exchanges, it may see a significant increase in value, and XRP investors may see a positive outcome that will benefit them."</li>
