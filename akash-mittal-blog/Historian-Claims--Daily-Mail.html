    <p>Once upon a time, there was a historian who made an astonishing claim regarding a popular newspaper. According to him, the Daily Mail played a crucial role in shaping public opinion about immigrants and refugees in the UK. His research revealed that the newspaper used sensationalist headlines, fake news, and biased reporting to create a negative image of these marginalized groups.</p>
    <p>But this was not an isolated case. Throughout history, media outlets have wielded immense power in shaping public opinion and influencing political discourse. From wartime propaganda to election campaigns, from social movements to corporate scandals, the media has been both a mirror and a catalyst of societal changes.</p>
    <h2>Real-life Examples</h2>
    <p>One of the most notorious examples of media manipulation is the case of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989. The oil tanker ran ashore in Alaska, causing one of the worst environmental disasters in history. However, Exxon's PR team went into overdrive to downplay the extent of the damage, blame the captain for the accident, and discredit any scientific evidence to the contrary. The media largely fell for this narrative, helping Exxon to avoid taking full responsibility and compensating the affected communities.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, there are also instances of media activism that have brought about positive change. For example, the #MeToo movement, which started as a hashtag on social media, exposed the rampant sexual harassment and assault in various industries. The media played a crucial role in amplifying the voices of survivors, shedding light on the scale of the problem, and holding perpetrators accountable.</p>
    <h2>Hyperlinking the Main Companies</h2>
    <p>Going back to the Daily Mail controversy, it is worth noting that the newspaper is part of the wider media conglomerate Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL), which also owns other popular titles such as The Mail on Sunday and Metro. ANL is itself a subsidiary of the Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT), which has interests in various media and entertainment businesses.</p>
    <p>Similarly, ExxonMobil is one of the largest oil and gas companies in the world, with a revenue of over $230 billion in 2020. Its public image has been tarnished by numerous environmental and human rights violations, including the Valdez spill and its complicity in the genocide of the indigenous Ogoni people in Nigeria. However, the company's profits and political clout have shielded it from facing the full consequences of its actions.</p>
    <h2>Conclusions and Critical Comments</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>The media is a double-edged sword that can be used for both good and bad purposes.</li>
     <li>The power of the media lies not only in what it says, but also in what it chooses to ignore or prioritize.</li>
     <li>The responsibility to use the media ethically and responsibly rests on all stakeholders, including journalists, editors, owners, regulators, and the public.</li>
