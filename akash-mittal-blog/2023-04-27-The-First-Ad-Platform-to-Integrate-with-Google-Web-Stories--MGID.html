   <p>Once upon a time, there was a company called MGID. This company was founded in 2008 and quickly became one of the leading native advertising platforms in the world. Its goal was simple - connect advertisers with publishers in order to drive traffic, increase engagement, and boost revenue.</p>
   <p>Over the years, MGID has continued to innovate and expand its offerings. In 2021, it became the first ad platform to integrate with Google Web Stories, a new format for mobile that allows publishers to create immersive, full-screen experiences using a combination of text, images, and videos.</p>
   <p>What does this mean for advertisers and publishers? Here are some concrete examples:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Advertisers can now reach audiences in a more engaging and interactive way, creating ads that resemble the look and feel of Web Stories content.</li>
    <li>Publishers can monetize their Web Stories by featuring MGID ads, generating revenue while providing users with seamless, non-intrusive experiences.</li>
    <li>Both parties benefit from MGID's advanced targeting and optimization capabilities, ensuring that the right content is delivered to the right people at the right time.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Overall, this integration is a major win for the industry, as it brings together two powerful platforms that are focused on user engagement and ad effectiveness. It's also a sign of the ongoing evolution of native advertising, which continues to evolve as new formats and technologies emerge.</p>
