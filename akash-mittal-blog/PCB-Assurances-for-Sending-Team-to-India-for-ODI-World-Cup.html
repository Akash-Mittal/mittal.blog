  <main>
   <p>The history of cricket between India and Pakistan is filled with many unforgettable moments. One such moment was the India versus Pakistan match in the 2011 World Cup semi-final at Mohali, India. As the two arch-rivals faced off against each other, the world held its breath in anticipation.</p>
   <p>It was a high-pressure game, and both teams fought hard to win. Team India, riding on the back of Sachin Tendulkar's 85-run knock, managed to put up a competitive total of 260 runs on the board. Pakistan started off poorly, losing early wickets, but captain Shahid Afridi and Misbah-ul-Haq showed some resistance with a 100+ run partnership.</p>
   <p>As the match came down to the wire, Afridi got out, and the Pakistani tail-enders were unable to keep up with the required run-rate. The match ended with India winning by 29 runs, and with it, a ticket to the World Cup Final against Sri Lanka.</p>
   <p>The excitement and drama of that game, and the emotions and intensity displayed by both teams, is a testament to the spirit of cricket. Such moments remind us of the importance of the sport and why it brings people together.</p>
   <h2>ICC Top Brass Seeks PCB Assurances for Sending Team to India for ODI World Cup</h2>
   <p>The year 2023 will see cricket's biggest stage, the ODI World Cup, take place in India. The International Cricket Council (ICC) recently sought assurances from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that it would send its team to India for the tournament.</p>
   <p>This request comes in the wake of the tense political relations between the two neighboring countries, which often spills over to the cricket field. The last time Pakistan played a bilateral series in India was in 2012, and since then, the two teams have only faced each other in ICC tournaments or in neutral venues.</p>
   <p>The ICC's request is understandable given the importance of having all the ICC members participate in the World Cup. Without Pakistan, the tournament loses its charm, and the fans are deprived of a potential India-Pakistan clash. Such a match brings in huge revenues and eyeballs and is a highlight of every World Cup.</p>
   <h2> Loss Incurred Without Pakistan's Participation</h2>
   <p>The absence of Pakistan in the 2019 World Cup held in England and Wales was felt by all. The fans missed the energy, passion, and unpredictability that the Pakistani team brings to the table. The broadcasters missed out on viewership and advertising revenue due to the lack of a potential India-Pakistan game.</p>
   <p>The financial loss incurred by Pakistan due to its absence from the World Cup was also significant. According to a report by the Pakistan Cricket Board, the team lost approximately $90 million in revenue by not participating in the tournament. The loss was mainly due to broadcast rights, sponsorships, and prize money.</p>
   <p>It is evident that the non-participation of Pakistan has a ripple effect on all stakeholders involved. Therefore, it is imperative that the PCB assures the ICC of its participation in the upcoming World Cup.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, the sport of cricket brings people together, and we must not allow political tensions to hinder its progress. The upcoming World Cup in India is a chance for all teams to showcase their skills and compete on the biggest stage.</p>
   <p>The PCB must assure the ICC of its participation, not just for the sake of the tournament but also for the sport. The rivalry between India and Pakistan has given us some unforgettable moments, and we hope that it will continue to do so in the future.</p>
   <p>But above all, let us remember the spirit of cricket and its ability to unite people despite their differences.</p>
