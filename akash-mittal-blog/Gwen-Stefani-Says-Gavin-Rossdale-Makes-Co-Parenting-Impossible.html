   <p>Divorce is difficult, but when children are involved, there's an added layer of complexity. Hollywood is full of high-profile divorces, and unfortunately, many of them come with a slew of co-parenting challenges. One such situation is the co-parenting dynamic between Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale.</p>
   <p>Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale were married for 13 years before divorcing in 2015. The couple shares three children: Kingston, Zuma, and Apollo. After the divorce, the couple agreed to joint custody of the children, but Stefani has recently shared that co-parenting with Rossdale has become impossible.</p>
   
   <p>Stefani has cited several examples of the challenges she faces when attempting to co-parent with Rossdale. One example is Rossdale's frequent travels, which make it difficult for him to have consistent and reliable parenting time with the children. Stefani has also raised concerns about Rossdale's parenting choices, such as allowing the children to have access to adult content on their phones.</p>
   <p>In addition, Stefani has expressed her frustration with Rossdale's lack of communication. She has shared that when she attempts to contact Rossdale about important parenting decisions, she often receives no response or a delayed response. This lack of communication has made it difficult for the couple to make joint decisions regarding their children.</p>
