   <p>It's a typical scene in universities today. Students hunched over their laptops, fingers tapping away furiously on their keyboards, their eyes glued to the screen. But instead of studying or conducting research, they are chatting on ChatGPT - a new platform that's gaining popularity.</p>
   <p>ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence chatbot that can answer a wide range of questions, from simple ones like "What's the weather like?" to more complex ones like "How do I solve this mathematical problem?"</p>
   <p>While ChatGPT can be a useful tool for students, it can also be a distraction. Many universities are concerned that the increased use of ChatGPT may negatively impact students' academic performance.</p>
   <p>That's why universities are trying to strike a balance. They want to encourage students to use ChatGPT for learning purposes, while also ensuring that it doesn't distract them from their studies.</p>
   <h2>Concrete Examples</h2>
   <p>Here are some examples of how universities are trying to balance the use of ChatGPT:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Some universities are offering workshops to teach students how to use ChatGPT effectively for research purposes.</li>
    <li>Others are incorporating ChatGPT into their curriculum, using it as a tool for class discussions and assignments.</li>
    <li>Some universities are limiting the use of ChatGPT during class hours, to ensure that students are focused on the material being taught.</li>
    <li>Others are implementing software that can track students' usage of ChatGPT, to identify any problems and offer necessary interventions.</li>
   </ul>
