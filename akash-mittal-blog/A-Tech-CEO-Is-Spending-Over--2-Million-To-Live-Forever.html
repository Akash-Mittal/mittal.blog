   <p>John Riccitiello, a former CEO of game development company Electronic Arts, is currently leading a new venture that aims to extend human life indefinitely. He's investing over $2 million in Unity Biotechnology, a company that's developing drugs to prevent age-related diseases.</p>
   <p>After witnessing the death of a close friend, Riccitiello became obsessed with the idea of conquering death. He believes that aging is a disease that can be cured, and he's willing to put his money and his beliefs to the test.</p>
   <p>Unity Biotechnology is targeting senescent cells, which are cells that have stopped dividing and accumulated damage over time. These cells are believed to contribute to many age-related diseases, such as arthritis, heart disease, and Alzheimer's. Unity is developing drugs that can selectively eliminate these cells, thus preventing or reversing these diseases.</p>
   <p>Other companies are also working on anti-aging drugs, such as Calico, a subsidiary of Alphabet (Google's parent company), and Human Longevity, founded by genomics pioneer Craig Venter. These companies are attracting investors and generating buzz, as the prospect of living longer and healthier is a tantalizing one.</p>
   <p>However, critics point out that the pursuit of immortality raises ethical and practical concerns. Will only the wealthy be able to afford life-extending treatments? Will overpopulation and resource depletion become even bigger issues? What are the psychological and social implications of having an aging population that refuses to die?</p>
   <p>Despite these questions, the race to live forever seems to be picking up speed, with more and more companies joining the fray. Whether they succeed or not, the quest for eternal life will certainly have a profound impact on society and human nature.</p>
