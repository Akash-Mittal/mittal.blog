   <p>I had the pleasure of interviewing Lance Bass and he shared with me about his journey as a parent and how it has impacted him personally. What struck me was how much he has grown since becoming a father. Lance confessed that fatherhood has helped him overcome his worst quality, which had followed him for almost his entire life.</p>
   <p>Lance Bass is a famous singer, actor, and producer. He rose to fame as a member of the boy band NSYNC in the late 90s and early 2000s. He has also been an advocate for the LGBTQ+ community, and in 2019, he and his husband Michael Turchin became parents to twins via surrogate.</p>
   <p>During our conversation, Lance shared about his worst quality, which he described as his inability to let go of control. He said that he had always been a perfectionist and would become anxious when things didn't go according to plan. He would often try to control his surroundings, which led to stress and anxiety.</p>
   <p>However, since becoming a parent, Lance has had to learn to let go of control. He realized that he could not control everything as a parent, and that some things were beyond his control. He explained that being a parent has taught him to be more patient, flexible, and adaptable.</p>
   
   <p>Lance shared some specific examples of how he has overcome his worst quality through parenthood. One example he gave was when his twins were born premature. He said that it was a difficult time for him and his husband, as they had to spend a lot of time in the hospital with their babies. However, Lance said that this experience taught him to be more patient and that he could not control everything.</p>
   <p>He also shared that he used to be very particular about the way things were done in his home. However, since becoming a parent, he has had to learn to be more flexible and allow his children to make a mess and be themselves. He said that he has learned to embrace the chaos and enjoy the journey.</p>
   <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
   <p>Lance also shared some practical tips for parents who struggle with letting go of control. He suggested learning to take deep breaths and practice mindfulness when feeling anxious. He also recommended finding moments of joy in the chaos and embracing the imperfections of parenting. Finally, he advised parents to remember that they cannot control everything and to focus on what they can control.</p>
