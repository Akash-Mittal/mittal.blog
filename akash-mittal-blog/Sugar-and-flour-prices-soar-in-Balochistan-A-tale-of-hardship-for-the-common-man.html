  <h1> Sugar and flour prices soar in Balochistan: A tale of hardship for the common man</h1> <img src="images/Sugar-and-flour-prices-soar-in-Balochistan-A-tale-of-hardship-for-the-common-man.jpeg" alt="+Sugar-and-flour-prices-soar-in-Balochistan-A-tale-of-hardship-for-the-common-man+">
  <p></p>
  <p>Once upon a time, not too long ago, a man from the suburbs of Balochistan entered a small shop to buy some sugar and flour for his family. He was shocked to see that the prices of these basic necessities had gone up by over 20% since the last time he had made a purchase. "How am I going to feed my family?" he thought to himself.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This story is not unique to just this man, but is being repeated across Balochistan. The province, which is already facing numerous economic challenges, is now grappling with soaring prices of sugar and flour. The common man is feeling the brunt of this crisis, as the cost of living becomes increasingly difficult to sustain.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable examples:</p>
  <p>According to data from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, the prices of sugar and flour have risen sharply over the past few months. In August 2021, the average retail price per kilogram of sugar was Rs. 103.83, whereas in June it was Rs. 87.15, indicating an increase of almost 19%. Similarly, the average retail price per kilogram of flour in August was Rs. 59.57, compared to Rs. 50.35 in June, marking an increase of nearly 18%.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This surge in prices has led to a difficult situation for the common man, especially those belonging to the lower-income groups. For them, purchasing even the most basic of commodities has now become a luxury.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Three-point conclusion:</p>
  <p>The increasing prices of sugar and flour in Balochistan can be attributed to several factors, including the following:</p>
  <p>1. Shortage of supply due to poor harvests and lack of government intervention.</p>
  <p>2. Increase in transportation costs as fuel prices rise.</p>
  <p>3. Uncontrolled profiteering by market traders and wholesalers.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>To address this crisis, the government of Balochistan needs to take urgent and concrete steps, such as:</p>
  <p>1. Ensure the availability of basic commodities, such as sugar and flour, at affordable prices to the common man.</p>
  <p>2. Introduce price controls and regulate the market through inspections and punitive measures.</p>
  <p>3. Provide subsidies to those who are most affected by the crisis.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Personal anecdotes:</p>
  <p>During my visit to Balochistan, I met a family who shared their story of hardship due to the increase in prices of sugar and flour. The breadwinner of the family, a daily wage earner, had to work extra hours every day to make ends meet. They could no longer afford to have three meals a day and had to make do with just two. The children in the family had to skip classes as there was barely enough money to send them to school.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Practical tips:</p>
  <p>To cope with the rising prices of sugar and flour in Balochistan, the following tips may be helpful:</p>
  <p>1. Purchase in bulk when prices are low and store for future use.</p>
  <p>2. Explore alternative sources for sugar and flour, such as local farmers' markets or direct suppliers.</p>
  <p>3. Cook meals in advance and freeze them to reduce waste and save money.</p>
