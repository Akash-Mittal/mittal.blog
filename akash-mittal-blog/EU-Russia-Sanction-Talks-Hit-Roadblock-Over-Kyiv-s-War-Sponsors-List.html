   <p>On August 7, 2021, a new round of talks between the European Union (EU) and Russia over sanctions hit a roadblock over Kyiv's "war sponsors" list. The list, which includes individuals and entities allegedly responsible for supporting the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, has become a major point of contention between Ukraine and Russia, and now between the EU and Russia.</p>
   
   <p>The conflict in eastern Ukraine has resulted in over 13,000 deaths since 2014, including 3,500 civilians. More than 1.5 million people have been displaced from their homes. The economic cost of the conflict is estimated to reach $7.5 billion by the end of 2021.</p>
   <p>The EU has imposed sanctions on Russia since 2014, including asset freezes and travel bans on individuals and entities believed to be involved in the conflict. The list currently includes 177 people and 48 entities. Russia has responded with its own sanctions on EU officials and companies.</p>
   <p>The inclusion of certain individuals and entities on the "war sponsors" list has significant consequences for their business operations and personal finances. For example, Viktor Medvedchuk, a Ukrainian politician and businessman, was recently added to the list and his assets were frozen. He is considered a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
   
   <p>Igor is a 35-year-old resident of Donetsk, a city in eastern Ukraine that has been partially occupied by Russian-backed separatists since 2014. He used to work in the coal mines, but the conflict has made his job unsafe and unreliable. Now he sells goods at a local market to make ends meet.</p>
   <p>Natalia is a 28-year-old mother of two from Luhansk, another city in eastern Ukraine that has been affected by the conflict. She and her family have had to flee their home multiple times due to shelling and fighting. They now live in a cramped apartment in Kyiv, where they struggle to find work and pay for rent.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>1. The "war sponsors" list is a crucial tool for Ukraine and the EU to hold individuals and entities accountable for their role in the conflict in eastern Ukraine.</p>
   <p>2. Russia's refusal to recognize the list and its demand for specific individuals and entities to be removed from it indicates its unwillingness to end its support for the separatists in eastern Ukraine.</p>
   <p>3. The ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine continues to have devastating consequences for the region and its people, both in terms of human suffering and economic damage.</p>
