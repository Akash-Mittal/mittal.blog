   <p>It was a moment that captured the attention of the world – Canadian MP Paulin Alabanese sharing a warm hug with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to Toronto.

   <p>Indian Americans are one of the most successful immigrant groups in the United States, with a median household income of over $100,000 – well above the national average. They also hold high levels of education and are well-represented in fields such as engineering, finance, and technology.</p>
