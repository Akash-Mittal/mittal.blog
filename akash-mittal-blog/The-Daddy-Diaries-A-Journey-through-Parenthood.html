    <p>A few years ago, Andy Cohen, an American television personality and producer, became a single parent to his son Benjamin through surrogacy.

    <p>The book chronicles Andy's journey through parenthood, from the initial decision to become a father, to the emotional rollercoaster of the surrogacy process, to the sleepless nights and diaper changes, to the joys of watching his son grow up and develop his own personality.</p>
    <p>But "The Daddy Diaries" is not just a memoir of one man's journey; it also provides insights and advice for other parents, especially those who are going it alone or facing unconventional challenges.</p>
