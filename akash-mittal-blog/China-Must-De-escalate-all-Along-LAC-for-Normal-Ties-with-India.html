  <h1>China must de-escalate all along LAC for normal ties with India</h1> <img src="images/China-must-de-escalate-all-along-LAC-for-normal-ties-with-India.jpeg" alt="+China-must-de-escalate-all-along-LAC-for-normal-ties-with-India+">
  <p>It was a beautiful summer morning when Vishal, a resident of Ladakh, woke up to a loud commotion outside his house. As he looked out of the window, he saw Chinese troops intruding into Indian territory. Vishal watched in shock as the soldiers erected tents and set up checkpoints on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Just like that, his peaceful world was turned upside down.</p>
  <p>Vishal is just one of thousands of Indians who have been affected by China's recent aggression along the LAC. The two countries have been engaged in a tense standoff since May 2020, with both sides blaming the other for the escalation. China claims that India has been infringing on its territory in Ladakh, while India says that China has been intruding into its territory.</p>
  <p>The situation has been complicated by the fact that there is no clearly demarcated border between the two countries along the LAC. This leaves ample room for disputes and misunderstandings, and both sides have been accused of crossing the line and trespassing into the other's territory.</p>
  <p>The standoff has had a profound impact on the bilateral ties between India and China. It has led to a widespread anti-China sentiment in India, with many calling for a boycott of Chinese goods and services. It has also heightened tensions between the two countries, with both sides increasing their military presence along the LAC.</p>
  <h2>The need for de-escalation</h2>
  <p>The only way to restore normal ties between India and China is for China to de-escalate all along the LAC. This means withdrawing its troops and dismantling its camps and checkpoints. Only then can dialogue and negotiations begin between the two countries to resolve their border issues.</p>
  <p>China must also commit to respecting India's sovereignty and territorial integrity. This means refraining from any actions that could be seen as aggressions, such as building infrastructure or conducting military exercises near the LAC.</p>
  <p>The benefits of de-escalation could be immense. It would not only reduce tensions between the two countries but also pave the way for greater economic cooperation. India and China are two of the fastest-growing economies in the world and have a lot to gain from working together. A peaceful border would allow them to focus on mutual development and prosperity.</p>
  <h2>Quantifiable examples</h2>
  <p>The standoff between India and China has had a significant impact on trade between the two countries. According to data from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, India's imports from China fell by 27.63% year-on-year in April 2020. Exports to China also fell by 12.64% in the same period. This is a clear indication that the ongoing tensions are hurting economic ties between the two countries.</p>
  <p>Another quantifiable example is the number of troops that both sides have deployed along the LAC. According to reports, China has deployed around 50,000 troops in the region, while India has deployed around 30,000 troops. This is a significant military buildup that could have disastrous consequences if the situation escalates.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, China must de-escalate all along the LAC for normal ties with India. This means withdrawing troops and dismantling camps and checkpoints. It also means committing to respecting India's sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>
  <p>The benefits of de-escalation are immense, both for India and China. It would reduce tensions and allow for greater economic cooperation. It would also prevent the standoff from escalating into a full-blown conflict.</p>
