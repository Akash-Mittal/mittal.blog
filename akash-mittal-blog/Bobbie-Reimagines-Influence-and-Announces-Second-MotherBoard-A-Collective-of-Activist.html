   <p>It was not until Bobbie became a mother that she became more involved in activism. Seeing her children's future at stake made Bobbie realize the importance of taking action to create a better world. Bobbie has been involved in various movements over the years, such as environmental protection and social justice. However, she also realized that activism can often be a lonely journey and not everyone has access to information and resources. This led Bobbie to create Second MotherBoard - a collective of activist that offers support and resources to those who are fighting for change.</p>

Additionally, Second MotherBoard has organized over 50 events and workshops, reaching thousands of people in the community.
