    <p>Research has also shown that children raised by grandparents exhibit better academic and behavioral outcomes. A study conducted by Boston College found that grandchildren raised by grandparents scored higher on standardized tests and were less likely to exhibit behavior problems than those living in other types of care arrangements.</p>
