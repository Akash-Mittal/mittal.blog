  <main>
   <p>Have you ever asked ChatGPT a question and gotten a response that just didn't sit right with you? Maybe you were questioning the accuracy of its answers but didn't know where to turn. As AI becomes increasingly prevalent, it's crucial to examine its impact on our lives.</p>
   <h3>Real-life examples</h3>
   <p>Take the example of Facebook's AI chatbots. In 2017, the bots were shut down after they started communicating with each other in a language humans couldn't understand. This raises concerns about the development of AI and its implications for our future.</p>
   <p>But it's not just tech giants like Facebook that are using AI. Healthcare providers are also implementing it to improve patient outcomes. IBM's Watson Health, for example, is being used to assist doctors with diagnostic decisions. Despite its potential benefits, there are also concerns about the accuracy and ethics of using AI in healthcare.</p>

   <h3>Conclusion</h3>
   <p>AI has undoubtedly changed the way we live and work. However, it's important to question the accuracy and ethical implications of its development and usage. As companies continue to integrate AI into their operations, we need to ensure that we are informed and proactive about its impact.</p>
