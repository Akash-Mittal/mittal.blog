    <p>It was a busy day at the airport, passengers were rushing to their gates, trying not to miss their flights. I was traveling for work, and as I looked at my phone, I realized that my flight was delayed for three hours. Great! Now, I had to find something to do for the next three hours, I decided to grab a cup of coffee and sit in one of the chairs in the waiting area. I took out my phone and started browsing. I noticed that the airline had a chatbot service that provided mid-journey prompts. I decided to give it a try, and I was pleasantly surprised by how helpful it was. The prompts were engaging, useful, and kept me entertained throughout my wait. I was impressed by how easy it was to use, and it made me wonder how many other passengers were benefiting from this service.</p>
