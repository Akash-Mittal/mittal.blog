  <h1>The Casual Side of Meghan Markle in Friend's Mother's Day Tribute</h1> <img src="images/Meghan-Markle-s-Casual-Dressing-in-Friend-s-Mother-s-Day-Tribute.jpeg" alt="+Meghan-Markle-s-Casual-Dressing-in-Friend-s-Mother-s-Day-Tribute+">
  <p>It's not every day you see the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, dressed down and casual. But that's exactly what happened in a recent Mother's Day tribute posted by her friend, Janina Gavankar.</p>
  <p>The tribute featured a series of candid photos of Gavankar and her mother, along with other photos of mothers and daughters, including one of Meghan and her own mother, Doria Ragland. In the photo, Meghan is dressed casually in a striped shirt and wide-leg pants, her hair in a messy bun. It's a far cry from the polished and sophisticated look we're used to seeing from Meghan, but it's also a reminder that even royals have their casual moments.</p>
  
  <p>Meghan Markle is known for her impeccable style and has influenced fashion trends around the world. According to a study by global fashion search platform, Lyst, Meghan Markle was the most influential dresser of 2019, with her outfits sparking a 216% increase in searches for similar items. Her fashion choices have boosted the sales of various brands and designers, and she has been praised for her commitment to sustainable and ethical fashion.</p>
  <p>However, even with her status as a fashion icon, Meghan has always emphasized the importance of dressing for comfort and practicality. In a blog post for her now-defunct lifestyle website, The Tig, Meghan wrote, "Be kind to yourself...if you feel good in something, wear it. Don't fall prey to the idea that you have to look a certain way to be polished and presentable. Real style is about self-expression."</p>
