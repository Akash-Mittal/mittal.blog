     <p>It's 2025 and the stock market has just experienced one of its biggest crashes in years. Panic ensues as investors scramble to sell their stocks and avoid huge losses. But there's one group of investors who remain calm and collected: those who invested in AI technology.</p>
     <p>Thanks to AI algorithms that are able to analyze vast amounts of data in milliseconds, these investors were able to predict the crash before it happened and adjust their portfolios accordingly. They knew which stocks to keep and which ones to sell, and as a result, they were able to mitigate their losses and even come out ahead.</p>
     <p>This is not a far-fetched scenario. In fact, it's becoming increasingly clear that AI technology is the future of the stock market. With the ability to crunch data, identify patterns, and make predictions in real-time, AI is changing the way we think about investing.</p>

     <p>Let's take a look at some quantifiable examples of how AI is already making an impact in the stock market:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>The AI-powered hedge fund, Numerai, has outperformed the average hedge fund by 120% since its launch in 2015.</li>
      <li>BlackRock, one of the largest asset management firms in the world, is using AI to analyze news articles and social media sentiment in order to make investment decisions.</li>
      <li>JPMorgan Chase has developed an AI system called COiN that is able to interpret complex financial documents like loan agreements and automate tasks like compliance checks.</li>
      <li>Goldman Sachs is using AI to power its newly-launched online bank, Marcus, which offers high-yield savings accounts and personal loans.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>These are just a few examples of how AI is already being used in the stock market, and there are many more to come.</p>

     <h2>Two Stocks to Buy Right Now</h2>
     <p>So, which stocks should you be investing in if you want to take advantage of AI's potential in the stock market? Here are two stocks that are worth considering:</p>
     <h3>Alphabet (GOOGL)</h3>
     <p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is a leader in AI research and development. Its Google Cloud platform offers a range of AI-powered tools and services, such as Google Cloud AutoML, which allows users to build custom machine learning models without needing a PhD in data science. In addition, Alphabet's subsidiary, DeepMind, has made significant breakthroughs in areas such as healthcare and energy efficiency through its deep reinforcement learning algorithms.</p>
     <h3>NVIDIA (NVDA)</h3>
     <p>NVIDIA is a leading chipmaker that specializes in graphics processing units (GPUs). While GPUs are primarily used for video games, they are also ideal for processing large amounts of data quickly - making them essential for AI applications. NVIDIA's GPUs are used by companies such as Amazon and Microsoft in their cloud-based AI services, and the company is also developing its own AI solutions for self-driving cars, healthcare, and more.</p>
