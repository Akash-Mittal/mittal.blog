    <p>The India-China border clash of 2020, which resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers, was a turning point. It signaled a shift in India's stance towards China, and led to a strengthening of ties with the US.</p>
    <p>The US House Committee on China released a report in 2021 calling for a strong US-India partnership to counter China's economic and military influence. The report cited numerous examples of Chinese aggression, including cyberattacks and trade imbalances, and called for a coordinated effort between the US and India to combat these threats.</p>
    <p>The US and India have also entered into defense agreements, including the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) and the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA), which allow for greater military cooperation and information sharing.</p>
