    <p>Shaquille O'Neal, former NBA superstar and father of 6, made headlines in 2016 when he refused to hand out a whopping 600 million dollars in inheritance to his children. Many were shocked by his decision, as it went against the traditional expectations one might have of a wealthy parent.</p>
    <p>However, Shaq had his reasons. He wanted to teach his children the value of hard work and how to make their own money. With his own upbringing in mind, he knew that simply giving them a massive amount of money would not benefit them in the long run.</p>
    <p>Instead, he has encouraged his children to pursue their own passions and build their own careers. He has also set up trust funds for them, ensuring their financial security while still giving them the freedom to establish themselves on their own.</p>

    <p>Perhaps one of the most remarkable aspects of Shaq's story is the fact that he has managed to raise successful children without giving them a huge inheritance. His son, Shareef, is a highly recruited college basketball player and his daughter, Amirah, is a skilled musician and artist. Both have pursued their respective passions with talent and drive, without relying solely on their father's wealth.</p>
    <p>Additionally, Shaq's focus on hard work and dedication has also served him well in his own business ventures. He owns a number of restaurants, including the popular "Big Chicken" in Las Vegas, and has invested in various companies over the years. His net worth is estimated to be around 400 million dollars, a testament to his own dedication and work ethic.</p>
