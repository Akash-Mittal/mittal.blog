     <h2>Introduction</h2>
     <p>Imagine you're driving a car and are about to crash into a pedestrian. You have two options: hit the pedestrian or swerve and hit a tree. What do you do?</p>
     <p>For most people, it's a split-second decision. But for self-driving cars powered by artificial intelligence (AI), it's a complex ethical question that requires a sophisticated algorithm to make the right decision.</p>
     <p>The problem is, Congress isn't prepared for this kind of technology. And if we don't start making changes now, we'll be facing a crisis in the near future.</p>

     <p>The lack of preparation is evident in the numbers. According to a report by the Artificial Intelligence and National Security Commission on AI, China is investing more than twice as much as the United States in AI-related research and development.</p>
     <p>Moreover, the report finds that China has already surpassed the United States in certain areas of AI, such as facial recognition technology.</p>
     <p>Another example is the lack of regulation surrounding AI. While other countries have implemented laws to regulate the use of AI, the United States has failed to do so.</p>

     <ol>
      <li>Congress needs to prioritize the development of AI technology and invest more in research and development to keep up with other countries.</li>
      <li>Congress needs to implement laws to regulate the use of AI, especially in sensitive areas such as national security.</li>
      <li>Congress needs to educate its members on the benefits and risks of AI technology to enable informed decision-making on related policies.</li>
