   <p>It was a warm summer day when I first realized I wanted to pursue a career in AI. I was sitting on the porch, staring at the clouds, when my father came up to me and asked what I wanted to be when I grew up. Without a second thought, I blurted out, "I want to build robots that can think for themselves!"</p>
   <p>Little did I know at the time, my dream wasn't too far-fetched. With the rapid advances in technology in recent years, AI had become a booming industry, and I was determined to be a part of it.</p>
   <p>After completing my degree in Computer Science, I landed my first job as a software engineer at a startup specializing in speech recognition. It was here that I was exposed to the incredible potential of AI, and the limitless possibilities it held for the future. The company grew rapidly, and before I knew it, I was leading a team of developers working on the next-generation of speech-to-text software.</p>
   <p>As my career progressed, I worked on a variety of AI products, from recommendation engines to chatbots, and each one was just as exciting as the last. I soon realized that AI wasn't just a job to me, it was a passion.</p>
