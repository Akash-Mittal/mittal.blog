    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>In the early 2000s, India and Australia found themselves at a crossroads. They were both looking to expand their global influence in a rapidly changing world. India was emerging as a major economic power, while Australia was seeking to build closer ties with its neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region. Both nations saw an opportunity to work together and promote multilateralism as a means of achieving their goals.</p>
    <p>Multilateralism, simply put, is the practice of coordinating with other countries to achieve common goals. This can take the form of economic cooperation, joint efforts on issues like climate change or security, or participation in international organizations like the United Nations. By working together with other nations, countries like India and Australia can achieve more than they would be able to alone, while also promoting peace and stability in the world.</p>

    <p>There are many examples of India and Australia working together to promote multilateralism. For example:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Both countries are founding members of the Indian Ocean Rim Association, which aims to promote economic cooperation in the region.</li>
     <li>India and Australia are both members of the G20, a group of the world's largest economies that meets regularly to coordinate on economic issues.</li>
     <li>The two countries have signed agreements on cooperation in areas such as defense, education, and trade.</li>
     <li>India and Australia are both strong supporters of the Paris Agreement on climate change, and have pledged to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
     <li>The two countries have a shared interest in promoting maritime security in the Asia-Pacific region, and have conducted joint military exercises to that end.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By collaborating in these and other areas, India and Australia have been able to achieve more than they would have been able to alone. They have also helped to promote the idea of multilateralism as a valuable tool for achieving global goals.</p>
