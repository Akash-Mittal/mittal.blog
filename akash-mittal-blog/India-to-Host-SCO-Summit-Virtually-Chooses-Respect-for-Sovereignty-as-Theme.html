   <!-- Start with an interesting story or anecdote to draw the reader in -->
   <p>India is all set to host the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit virtually this year, owing to the COVID-19 pandemic that has disrupted the world. The SCO is a Eurasian political, economic, and military organisation founded in 2001, with eight member states: China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. The summit, scheduled for September 2021, will be India's first as a full-fledged member of the organisation. As India prepares to host the summit, it has chosen 'Respect for Sovereignty' as the theme to emphasise the importance of respecting the sovereignty of nations in the current geopolitical climate.</p>
   <h2>The Importance of Sovereignty</h2>
   <p>'Respect for Sovereignty' is a timely theme for the SCO summit as nations around the world are grappling with questions around their territorial integrity and national sovereignty. India, for instance, is currently engaged in a long-standing territorial dispute with China over the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which resulted in a violent military clash in 2020 that left several soldiers dead.</p>
   <p>Similarly, other nations have also been facing sovereignty-related challenges. Ukraine, for example, has been in conflict with Russia ever since the latter annexed Crimea in 2014. The United Kingdom has had to navigate tensions with Scotland and Northern Ireland which have been pushing for greater autonomy from the central government in London.</p><!-- Include quantifiable examples to make your point -->
   <p>Respect for sovereignty is not just a theoretical concept, but it has real-world implications. When nation-states do not respect each other's sovereignty, it can lead to conflict, instability, and even war. On the other hand, when sovereignty is respected, it can lead to greater cooperation, peaceful coexistence, and progress.</p>
   <p>Take the example of the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which is the world's largest free trade area since the creation of the World Trade Organisation. The AfCFTA was established in 2020 with the aim of boosting intra-African trade, which had been hindered by tariffs and other trade barriers. By respecting each other's sovereignty, the African nations were able to come together and create a common framework for trade, which will hopefully lead to greater economic growth and prosperity for the continent.</p><!-- Include personal anecdotes or case studies to illustrate your points -->
   <p>Another example is the border dispute between India and Bangladesh, which was resolved in 2015 after a decades-long stalemate. The dispute centred around 162 enclaves, small pockets of land that were completely surrounded by the other nation's territory. The residents of these enclaves were stateless and had no access to basic amenities like water and electricity. However, by respecting each other's sovereignty and working towards a mutual solution, India and Bangladesh were able to exchange these enclaves and provide citizenship to the residents. It was a win-win situation for both nations, as it resolved a long-standing dispute and contributed to greater peace and stability in the region.</p><!-- Provide practical tips when possible -->
   <p>So, what can we do to respect each other's sovereignty? One practical tip is to emphasise the importance of international law and the United Nations Charter. These documents outline the principles of sovereignty and how nations should interact with each other. By promoting and adhering to these principles, we can create a more stable and peaceful world.</p>

   </blockquote>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2><!-- End the article with a conclusion summarising the main points -->
   <p>In conclusion, India's choice of 'Respect for Sovereignty' as the theme for the SCO summit is a timely one. With the world currently facing numerous challenges related to national sovereignty, it is crucial that we remember the importance of respecting each other's territorial integrity and working towards peaceful coexistence. By following the principles of international law and promoting mutual respect, we can create a more stable, prosperous, and peaceful world.</p>
