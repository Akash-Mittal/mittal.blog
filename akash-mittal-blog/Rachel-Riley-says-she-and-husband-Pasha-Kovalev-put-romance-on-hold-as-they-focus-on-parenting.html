   <p>Rachel Riley has admitted that she and her husband, Pasha Kovalev, have made the decision to put their romance on hold for the time being as they focus on being parents to their newborn daughter, Maven.</p>
   <p>Speaking to <i>The Sun</i>, the former <i>Strictly Come Dancing</i> star explained that the couple is trying to give their child the best possible start in life by dedicating their time and energy to her care.</p>
   <p>"Right now, it's all about Maven, and we're putting our relationship on hold," she said. "We're both working hard to be the best parents we can be and to give her all the love and attention she deserves."</p>
   <p>While some may find Riley and Kovalev's decision to put their romantic relationship temporarily on hold surprising, the reality is that many new parents find themselves in a similar situation.</p>
   <p>When a new child comes into the picture, everything else in life takes a back seat as parents try to navigate the challenges and joys that come with raising a child. It's a time of immense change and growth, and it's only natural that some things - like romance - may take a back seat for a time.</p>
   <h2> Prioritizing Parenting</h2>
   <p>For Riley and Kovalev, prioritizing their parenting duties may mean putting aside some of the activities or hobbies they used to enjoy as a couple. Instead of going out for date nights or spending time alone together, they may be spending their evenings at home, tending to Maven's needs and making sure she gets enough rest and attention.</p>
   <p>Similarly, they may be putting work obligations on hold or scaling back on their social lives in order to make room for the demands of parenthood. They may be investing in baby gear or services that will help make their lives easier, like hiring a nanny or purchasing a high-quality stroller.</p>
   <p>Ultimately, the quantifiable examples of Riley and Kovalev's decision to prioritize parenting are unique to their situation and personalities. For some parents, it may mean taking a break from work altogether to focus solely on their child's needs. For others, it may mean finding a balance between work and family responsibilities.</p>
   <h2>Why Prioritizing Parenting Is Important</h2>
   <p>At the end of the day, the decision to put romance on hold in order to focus on parenting speaks to the immense love and dedication that Riley and Kovalev have for their daughter. They want to make sure she has every opportunity to thrive and grow, and they're willing to make sacrifices in order to achieve that goal.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, prioritizing parenting in this way can have long-lasting benefits not just for the child, but for the entire family. By putting their child's needs first, Riley and Kovalev are likely strengthening their bond as a couple and building a strong foundation for their family's future.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion in Three Points</h2>

   </ol>
   <h2> and Practical Tips</h2>
   <p>As a new parent myself, I can relate to the challenges that come with trying to balance parenting with other aspects of life. It can be challenging to make time for hobbies, relationships, or work when there's a little one who needs constant attention and care.</p>
   <p>One of the things that's helped me as a new parent is finding ways to incorporate my child into the things I love. For example, instead of going out for dinner and drinks with friends, my partner and I will have a dinner party at home and invite our friends over to meet our child. Instead of going to the gym or a fitness class, I'll take my child for a walk or a stroller jog in the park.</p>
   <p>At the same time, it's important to recognize when you need to take a break or ask for help. There's no shame in hiring a babysitter or asking for a family member to watch your child so you can have some time to yourself or with your partner. It's also important to communicate clearly with your partner about your needs and expectations, particularly when it comes to prioritizing parenting.</p>
