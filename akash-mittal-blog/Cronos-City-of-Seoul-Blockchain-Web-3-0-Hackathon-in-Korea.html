  <p>Imagine walking into a giant hall crowded with scores of participants, all cloaked in the latest in tech gear. Some of them huddle around high-powered laptops, while others scribble code on whiteboards and Post-It notes. Despite the bustle, a palpable sense of excitement and focus permeates the air, as everyone pitches in their expertise to build and develop the next big thing in the world of blockchain.</p>
  <p>This is the scene that will soon play out at the upcoming Hackathon event, organized by the City of Seoul in partnership with Cronos, one of the leading blockchain platforms in the industry. This international gathering of developers, designers, and entrepreneurs will focus on harvesting the potential of Web 3.0, with the aim of developing innovative blockchain solutions for real-world applications.</p>
  <h2>What is Web 3.0?</h2>
  <p>Web 3.0 is the next stage of evolution for the internet, expected to bring about major advancements in the way we interact with online systems and applications. While the current web - Web 2.0 - mostly focuses on connecting people and information, Web 3.0 adds deeper meaning to the interactions and thereby creates more value. It fosters a decentralized, trustless, and permissionless architecture, keeping the user in full control of their data. With Web 3.0, we can expect more secure, transparent, and efficient transfers of data and value, as well as a more seamless and personalized user experience.</p>
  <p>One example of how Web 3.0 is being applied in reality is through blockchain-based identity verifications. By creating a decentralized digital identity infrastructure, users can take control of their own online identities, reducing the risk of data leaks and hacks.</p>
  <h2>The Rise of Cronos City</h2>
  <p>Cronos City is a blockchain platform built on the Cosmos ecosystem, designed to realize the full potential of blockchain technology. It promises efficient proof-of-stake consensus algorithms, interoperability with other blockchain networks, and low transaction fees, making it an ideal platform for scaling Web 3.0 applications.</p>
  <p>The City of Seoul, for its part, has been actively promoting blockchain innovation in the country, having launched its own blockchain-based platform in 2019. The platform, called S-Logis, facilitates the tracking and recording of delivery and logistics data, with the aim of enhancing transparency and efficiency in the supply chain system. The city has also been nurturing startups in the blockchain space through a range of initiatives, in its bid to become a global hub for blockchain technology.</p>
