    <p>This is not the first time Kim Kardashian has come under fire for her parenting choices. In the past, she has been criticized for allowing her children to wear revealing clothing, for promoting unhealthy body standards, and for exposing them to social media at a young age.</p>
    <p>According to a study by the American Academy of Pediatrics, exposure to sexually explicit media can have harmful effects on children, including early sexual activity, increased risk of teen pregnancy, and risky sexual behavior.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, a survey by Common Sense Media found that nearly half of all teenagers have seen explicit content online, and a quarter of them say they have sent or received explicit images.</p>

    <h2> and Practical Tips</h2>
    <p>As a parent myself, I know how challenging it can be to keep up with the latest trends and to monitor my child's media consumption. However, I believe that it is essential for parents to stay informed and to have honest conversations with their children about the risks and consequences of exposure to explicit content.</p>
    <p>Some practical tips for parents include:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Establishing clear rules and guidelines around media consumption, including which websites, apps, and games are allowed.</li>
     <li>Limiting screen time and encouraging children to engage in other activities, such as reading, playing outside, or spending time with friends and family.</li>
     <li>Monitoring your child's online activity and educating them about the dangers of sharing personal information, interacting with strangers, and accessing explicit content.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By taking these steps, parents can help to protect their children from the negative effects of explicit media, and promote a healthy and positive relationship with technology.</p>
