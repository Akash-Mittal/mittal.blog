  <p>It was a hot summer day when I first stepped into a boxing ring. The air was thick with adrenaline and excitement as boxers grappled with each other, darting around the ring with expert footwork. The sound of leather gloves striking a punching bag echoed through the hall, and I found myself mesmerized by the raw power and skill on display.</p>
  <p>Over the years, my interest in the sport only grew, and I was delighted to come across Dr Darda's new book "Ringside", which offers an in-depth look at the fascinating world of boxing. Released by none other than the renowned author and politician Dr Tharoor in Delhi on May 30, this book delves into the history, culture, and psychology of the sport, providing readers with a wealth of insights and anecdotes that are sure to captivate both boxing enthusiasts and novices alike.</p>
  <h2>The Art and Science of Boxing</h2>

Dr Darda explores these aspects of the sport in fascinating detail, highlighting the different styles and strengths of boxers, along with the tactical considerations that come into play during a bout.</p>
  <p>For example, he discusses the importance of footwork and positioning, explaining how a boxer's ability to move around the ring and stay out of their opponent's reach can be just as critical as their punching power. He also touches on the mental aspect of the sport, highlighting the ways in which boxers must remain focused and composed amid intense pressure and physical exertion.</p>
  <p>To bring these concepts to life, Dr Darda includes numerous examples and case studies throughout the book, showcasing the skills and strategies of some of the greatest boxers of all time.

Dr Darda explores this aspect of the sport in depth, highlighting its role in popular culture and politics, as well as its history as a means of self-defense and survival.</p>
  <p>One of the book's most fascinating chapters discusses the ways in which boxing has been used as a platform for social and political causes. From Muhammad Ali's activism on behalf of civil rights to Manny Pacquiao's political career in the Philippines, Dr Darda examines how boxers throughout history have used their platform to effect change and make a positive impact on society.</p>
  <p>He also touches on the role of boxing in art and entertainment, exploring the ways in which the sport has been depicted in literature, film, and other media. From Rocky to Raging Bull, boxing has provided the inspiration for some of the most memorable characters and stories in popular culture.</p>
