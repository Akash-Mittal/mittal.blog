   <p>Imagine scrolling through a virtual world and suddenly finding an auction taking place. You spot an item from one of your favorite games, but it's sold out everywhere else. You decide to try your luck and place a bid, and before you know it, you're the proud owner of a rare item. This is just one of the many possibilities of Web3, and Google Cloud wants to help startups leverage this potential.</p>
   <p>In recent years, Google Cloud has been partnering with blockchain-based companies and startups that are focused on Web3 technologies. Web3, also known as the decentralized web, is a new paradigm for the internet that is powered by blockchain technology. It allows users to create and interact with decentralized applications, enabling them to own their data and have more control over their online experiences.</p>
   <p>There are several examples of startups that have already used Google Cloud's infrastructure to build their Web3 platforms. For instance, Dapper Labs, the creator of NBA Top Shot, has been using Google Cloud's Kubernetes engine to support its platform. By using Kubernetes, Dapper Labs can easily scale its infrastructure as more users join the platform and trade digital assets.</p>
   <p>Another startup that has leveraged Google Cloud's infrastructure is Immutable X, a layer 2 scaling solution that allows for fast and cheap transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Immutable X uses Google Cloud's services, such as Bigtable and Pub/Sub, to handle massive amounts of data in real-time.</p>
   <h2>Why Web3 Matters</h2>
   <p>Web3 is more than just a new way of building applications. It has the potential to transform the internet as we know it, giving users more control over their data and enabling new types of online interactions. Here are three reasons why Web3 matters:</p>
   <ol>
    <li><b>Ownership:</b> Web3 allows users to truly own their data and digital assets. With traditional web applications, users have to trust third parties to store and manage their data. With Web3, users can store their data on the blockchain, which ensures that it's secure and cannot be tampered with.</li>
    <li><b>Decentralization:</b> Web3 applications are decentralized, meaning that they are powered by a network of users rather than a single company or organization. This makes them more resilient to attacks and censorship, as there is no single point of failure.</li>
    <li><b>New Business Models:</b> Web3 enables new types of business models that were not possible before. For instance, blockchain-based platforms can create new types of digital assets that can be bought, sold, and traded like traditional assets.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>Web3 is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to transform the internet as we know it. Google Cloud's expansion of partnerships with Web3 startups is a testament to the growing importance of this technology. By leveraging Google Cloud's infrastructure, startups can build scalable and secure applications that can power the next generation of the internet.</p>
