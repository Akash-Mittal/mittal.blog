   <p>It's that time of year again. The time when children and parents alike begin to feel the stress and anxiety that comes with the exam season. For parents, it can be especially difficult to watch their child struggle with the pressure of exams and tests. However, as parents, we can play an important role in helping our children manage their stress and overcome their exam worries through positive parenting.</p>
   <h2>A Personal Story of an Exam-worried Child</h2>
   <p>When my daughter Emily was in her final year of primary school, she was extremely worried about her end-of-year exams. She spent countless hours studying and revising, but despite her best efforts, she struggled to shake off her nerves and anxiety. As her parent, I desperately wanted to help her overcome her exam worries and succeed, but I wasn't sure where to start.</p>
   <p>After consulting with her teacher and doing some research on positive parenting, I began implementing a few simple strategies that helped Emily to manage her stress and perform better in her exams. Here are some of the things that worked for us:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Encouraging her to take regular breaks and engage in fun activities, like going for a walk or playing with her pet.</li>
    <li>Helping her to create a study schedule and sticking to it.</li>
    <li>Giving her plenty of emotional support and reminding her that we love and support her, regardless of her grades.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2> Positive Parenting</h2>
   <p>Positive parenting is all about setting clear expectations, providing a safe and nurturing environment, and giving children the tools they need to succeed. Here are some more quantifiable examples of how positive parenting can help children overcome their exam worries:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Children of positive parents are less likely to suffer from anxiety, depression and other mental health issues related to exam stress.</li>
    <li>Children of positive parents are more likely to have good time-management skills and academic success.</li>
    <li>Children of positive parents are more likely to develop a growth mindset, which is essential for success in any field.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>As parents, it's natural to want to help our children succeed in life. However, when it comes to exam stress and anxiety, sometimes our instincts can lead us astray. By practicing positive parenting strategies, we can help our children to overcome their worries and achieve academic success, without sacrificing their mental health and wellbeing.</p>
   <p>So, if you're a worried parent, remember that you're not alone. By implementing some of these strategies, you can help your child to manage their stress and achieve their full potential.</p>
