   <p>Once upon a time, parents believed that raising a child was a simple task. Feed, clothe, and love them. That was it. However, as times change, so do parenting trends. Nowadays, parents are more conscious of the impact they have on their children. This has resulted in a new trend of very earnest parenting that aims to optimize every aspect of a child's life.</p>
   <h2>What is Very Earnest Parenting?</h2>
   <p>Very Earnest Parenting, or VEP, is a parenting trend that prioritizes children's well-being above all else. Parents who follow this trend seek to optimize their child's development by managing every aspect of their life. From diet and exercise to education and extracurricular activities, VEP parents are constantly striving for perfection.</p>
   <h2> VEP</h2>
   <p>VEP can manifest in many ways, here are some quantifiable examples:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Spending on Education: VEP parents are willing to spend a lot of money on their child's education. This includes not just tuition fees, but also extracurricular activities, tutors, and test prep classes. In fact, research shows that VEP parents are willing to spend up to 4 times more on education than non-VEP parents.</li>
    <li>Structured Playtime: VEP parents believe that playtime is an essential part of a child's development. However, they also believe that playtime must be structured to optimize learning. As a result, VEP parents may invest in educational toys, games, and apps to make playtime more productive.</li>
    <li>Healthy Eating: VEP parents are highly aware of the impact of diet on a child's development. They prioritize healthy eating and may go to extraordinary lengths to ensure that their child is eating nutritious meals. For example, they may pack lunches instead of relying on school-provided meals or avoid certain types of food altogether.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>The Dark Side of VEP</h2>
   <p>While the intention behind VEP is noble, there is a downside to this parenting trend. The pressure to optimize every aspect of a child's life can put a lot of stress on both the parent and the child. Children may feel overwhelmed and burnt out from all the structured activities and pressure to perform. Parents, on the other hand, may feel like they are failing if their child doesn't meet their expectations.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, VEP is a new trend that prioritizes children's well-being above all else. While the intention behind VEP is noble, it is important to remember that children need downtime, unstructured playtime, and room to be individuals. Here are 3 key points to keep in mind when following VEP:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Be mindful of your child's stress levels and give them space to unwind.</li>
    <li>Remember that children are individuals with their own personalities and interests. Don't force them to conform to your expectations.</li>
    <li>A happy childhood is more important than a perfect childhood.</li>
   </ol>
