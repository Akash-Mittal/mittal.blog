  <p>When <span class="highlight">John</span> started working at a marketing firm, he was thrilled to have found a job that was in his field of expertise. However, he soon realized that he was struggling to balance his work commitments with the needs of his son who had been diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia.</p>
  <p>John's son required a lot of support in school, which meant taking time off work to attend teacher meetings, therapy sessions, and tutoring sessions. This resulted in John feeling overwhelmed and stressed, and he struggled to perform at his best at work.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, John's experience is not unique. Parents of neurodivergent children often face unique challenges that can make balancing work and home life extremely difficult.</p>
