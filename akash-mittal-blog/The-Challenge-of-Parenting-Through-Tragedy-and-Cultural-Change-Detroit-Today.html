    <h2>Personal Story: Parenting Through Tragedy and Cultural Change</h2>
    <p>When Emily's husband died unexpectedly in a car accident, she was left to raise their two young children on her own. She was devastated, overwhelmed, and unsure of how to move forward. On top of her personal grief, Emily was also dealing with the cultural changes in her community that she struggled to explain to her children.</p>
    <p>Her son was bullied by classmates for being biracial, and her daughter was confused about why her friends were suddenly talking about immigration and deportation. Emily felt like she was fighting a constant battle to shield her children from the harsh realities of the world while also preparing them for what may come.</p>
    <p>As she and her children worked through their grief, Emily realized that the best thing she could do was to be honest and open with them. She talked to them about their father, acknowledged their fears and worries, and encouraged them to ask questions. She also made a point to expose them to people from different backgrounds and cultures, so they could see that diversity is something to be celebrated, not feared.</p>
