    <h2>Why Old School Parenting Works</h2>
    <p>According to De Niro, old school parenting is about being consistent, firm, and loving. It's about setting boundaries, enforcing rules, and instilling values in your children. It's not about being their friend or trying to be cool. It's about being a parent first and foremost.</p>
    <p>De Niro believes that old school parenting works because it teaches children respect, discipline, and responsibility. It helps them develop a strong sense of self and prepares them for the challenges of life. He also believes that it's important for parents to lead by example and show their children the right way to live.</p>
    <p>One of the key aspects of old school parenting is discipline. De Niro believes that it's important to discipline children when they misbehave, but also to praise and reward them when they do well. He believes that children need to learn that there are consequences for their actions, and that they are responsible for their own behavior.</p>
    <p>Overall, De Niro's philosophy of old school parenting is grounded in common sense and practicality. It's about doing what works, not what's trendy or popular.</p>

    <h2>Examples of Old School Parenting in Action</h2>
    <p>De Niro's parenting style is exemplified in the way he raised his seven children. Here are some examples:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>De Niro enforced strict bedtime routines for his children, believing that they needed enough sleep to be healthy and focused in school.</li>
     <li>He encouraged his children to read and learn, and would often take them to the library and buy them books.</li>
     <li>De Niro also believed in being present for his children as much as possible, despite his busy career. He would attend their school events, help with homework, and spend quality time with them.</li>
     <li>Finally, De Niro also believes in the importance of tough love. He once famously said, "I don't believe in coddling children. I believe in tough love. If they miss out, then they learn. You have to learn to live in the real world."</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These examples show that old school parenting is not about being cold or harsh, but rather about being loving and nurturing while also instilling important values and principles.</p>
