    <h3>An interesting story to start with</h3>
    <p>Mark Zuckerberg hit the headline just recently with his net worth surpassing $200 billion after his company, Meta, experienced a surge in stock price. This is the first time a tech founder has broken the $200 billion mark, making Zuckerberg one of the world's richest people. However, this news comes as a shock to some, as Meta has been under fire lately for various reasons, including the recent ChatGPT row.</p>
    <h3>Real life examples</h3>
    <p>The ChatGPT row has sparked a lot of conversation in the tech community. It all started when an OpenAI researcher claimed that the ChatGPT model developed by the company was making racist and sexist statements. OpenAI had been using the ChatGPT model for various projects, and they immediately decided to stop using it. The controversy has led to a debate over the ethics of AI and how it can perpetuate biases.</p>
    <p>Meta isn't the only company in the hot seat. Uber recently lost a legal battle in the UK, which could set a precedent for other companies in the gig economy. The court ruled that Uber drivers are employees, not independent contractors, which means they are entitled to minimum wage and other worker protections. This could have a significant impact on Uber's bottom line, as it may have to pay back wages and expenses to its drivers.</p>
