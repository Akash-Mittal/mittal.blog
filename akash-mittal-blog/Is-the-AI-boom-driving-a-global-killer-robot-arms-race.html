   <p>Imagine a world where autonomous killer robots roam the streets looking for any human to eliminate. Scary as it may sound, this is not far from becoming a reality. With the global arms race gaining momentum and the boom of artificial intelligence, the development of killer robots is becoming more attractive to military organizations.</p>
   <p>In fact, some countries have already started working on their own killer robot projects, and experts warn that it's only a matter of time before we witness the first robot-on-human attack. So, what exactly is driving this trend and how can we prevent it from happening?</p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1519681393784-d120267933ba?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=crop&amp;fm=jpg&amp;h=800&amp;ixid=MnwxfDB8MXxyYW5kb218MHx8YXJtaW5hdGl2ZXwxfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8MTYzMjMwMzA2MQ&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600" alt="Autonomous robot standing on a dirt road">
   <h3>The AI boom and the global arms race</h3>
   <p>The development of autonomous weapons is not a new concept, but with the advancements in artificial intelligence, it has become a lucrative and strategic investment for many countries. In fact, according to a report by The New York Times, the number of countries investing in autonomous weapons has increased significantly in the past few years.</p>
   <p>China, for example, has been vocal about its ambitions to become the world leader in AI technology and has been investing heavily in autonomous weapons. In 2017, the country tested its first unmanned tanks, and in 2020, it unveiled a new drone that can carry missiles and reach supersonic speeds.</p>
   <p>Similarly, Russia has been developing its own autonomous weapons, including a robot tank and a drone that can take off and land vertically. Meanwhile, the United States has been working on a range of autonomous weapons, including self-driving trucks and unmanned naval vessels.</p>
   <p>The problem with autonomous weapons is that they can decide to take human lives without human intervention. This is different from traditional weapons, which require a human operator to pull the trigger or press the button. As a result, there are concerns that autonomous weapons could lead to unintended deaths and human rights violations.</p>
   <h3>Examples of killer robots</h3>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Slaughterbots:</strong> This is a video produced by the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots that went viral in 2017. The video depicts a dystopian future where autonomous drones are used to carry out targeted killings.</li>
    <li><strong>Harpy:</strong> Developed by Israel, the Harpy is a loitering munition that can fly for hours and detect radar signals. Once it detects a threat, it can dive-bomb it and destroy it.</li>
    <li><strong>Killer robots in science fiction:</strong> The Terminator, RoboCop, and The Matrix are all examples of killer robots in popular culture. While they are fictional, they have contributed to the fear and fascination with autonomous weapons.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>How can we prevent a robot-on-human attack?</h3>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>Developing international agreements:</strong> The Campaign to Stop Killer Robots is calling for an international ban on autonomous weapons. While some countries have expressed support for the ban, others have resisted it. However, developing international agreements could be a crucial step in preventing a global arms race.</li>
    <li><strong>Ensuring AI is aligned with human values:</strong> As AI becomes more advanced, it's important to ensure that it aligns with human values. This means implementing ethical guidelines and ensuring that AI is not used to harm humans.</li>
    <li><strong>Investing in peacebuilding:</strong> While military organizations may see autonomous weapons as a way to gain an advantage, investing in peacebuilding could be a more effective way to prevent conflict. This includes promoting dialogue and diplomacy, as well as investing in education and development.</li>
   </ol>
   <blockquote>
    "The world needs to act now before it's too late. Once killer robots are unleashed, there will be no going back. We need to work together to prevent a future where machines decide who lives and who dies." - Mary Wareham, global coordinator of the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots
