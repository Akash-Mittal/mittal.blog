   <p>Once upon a time, there was a land whose borders were always shifting and whose relationships with its neighboring countries were always strained. This land was India, whose geopolitical position has made it a key player in the complex web of international relations in Asia. In recent months, the relationship between two of its neighbors, China and Pakistan, has been particularly fraught, leading to India's decision to host a virtual meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). This meeting is an important opportunity for India to assert its leadership in the region and promote cooperation among its fellow SCO member states.</p>
   
   <p>One quantifiable example of the importance of this meeting is the fact that the SCO encompasses over 40% of the world's population, making it one of the largest international organizations in the world. Additionally, the SCO's members are home to some of the world's fastest-growing economies, with over a quarter of global GDP.</p>
