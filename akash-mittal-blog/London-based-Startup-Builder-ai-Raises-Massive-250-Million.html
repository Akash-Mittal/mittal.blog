  <p>With a track record of success, it's no surprise that "ai" has just raised a massive $250 million in funding. The funding round was led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2, with participation from a range of other investors.</p>

   <li><strong>A more hands-on approach</strong>: "ai" doesn't just provide funding; they also provide mentorship, networking opportunities, and other resources that startups need to succeed.</li>
