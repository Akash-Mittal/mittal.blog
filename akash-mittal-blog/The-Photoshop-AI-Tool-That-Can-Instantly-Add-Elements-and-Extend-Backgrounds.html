  <p>There's a common saying that a picture is worth a thousand words. With the dawn of social media and digital platforms, it seems that pictures now carry even more weight than before. The quality of images can make or break a website, advertisement, or marketing campaign. If you've been using Photoshop for a while, you know that it's an incredibly powerful tool, but sometimes it can be time-consuming to enhance an image to perfection. Luckily, Adobe has come up with an amazing solution to this problem.</p>
  <h2>Meet the Photoshop AI Tool</h2>
  <p>Adobe has been using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve its software's capabilities for a while, and now it has introduced an advanced Photoshop AI tool that can instantly add elements and extend backgrounds.
