    <h2>A New Era of Collecting</h2>
    <p>Do you remember how exciting it was to trade and collect sports cards as a kid? For many of us, the thrill of finding a rare card and adding it to our collection was unmatched. But as we grew older, the world of collecting evolved, and now, Panini is leading the charge of a new era of collecting - digital collectibles.</p>

    <h2>How Panini is Disrupting the Market with Web3</h2>
    <p>In recent years, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have taken the world by storm, providing collectors with a new way to verify ownership of unique digital assets. And Panini is now using web3 technology to create decentralized marketplaces and distribute rare digital collectibles via NFTs.</p>
    <p>What makes this approach so innovative is that it allows collectors to directly take ownership of the assets they purchase, rather than relying on a third-party intermediary to verify authenticity. This is all made possible by leveraging the power of blockchain and smart contracts, creating a secure and transparent ecosystem for the digital collectibles market.</p>

    <h2>Real-life Examples of Panini's Web3 Collectibles</h2>
    <p>In 2019, Panini teamed up with the NBA to launch NBA blockchain collectibles, making it the first professional sports league to introduce NFTs. Through this partnership, Panini has been able to release unique digital assets that capture some of the NBA's most iconic moments, from game-winning shots to dunk contests.</p>
    <p>Additionally, Panini has collaborated with the soccer club AC Milan to release a range of digital collectibles called "AC Milan Legends". These NFTs commemorate some of the most iconic moments in the history of the legendary Italian club, cementing the legacy of the team's greatest players and moments for generations to come.</p>
