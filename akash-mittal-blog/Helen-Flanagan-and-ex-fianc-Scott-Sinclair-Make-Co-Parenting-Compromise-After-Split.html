   <p>Breaking up is hard enough, but when there are children involved, it can make things even more complicated. That's why it's so important for separated parents to put their differences aside and focus on what's best for their kids.</p>
   <p>This is exactly what happened when former <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Flanagan">Coronation Street</a> star Helen Flanagan and her ex-fiancé, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Sinclair">Scott Sinclair</a>, decided to make a co-parenting compromise after their split.</p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/omRsxjB.png" alt="Helen Flanagan and Scott Sinclair">
   <h2>The Compromise</h2>
   <p>Helen and Scott have two daughters together, Matilda and Delilah. After their split, they decided to split custody of the girls 50/50, which means that they both get equal time with their children. This is a great solution because it ensures that the girls get to see both of their parents on a regular basis, and it also means that Helen and Scott don't have to fight about custody.</p>
   <p>Additionally, Helen and Scott have agreed to put their personal issues aside when it comes to their co-parenting arrangement. They have both made a commitment to be civil to each other and to work together for the sake of their children.</p>
   <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/20210901120295/helen-flanagan-scott-sinclair-co-parenting-compromise-following-split-exclusive/">Hello! Magazine</a>, Helen said:</p>
   <blockquote>
    "Scott and I are very polite with each other. It's all about the children. They love us both and we want to make sure they never feel like they have to choose between us. They deserve to have two happy and loving parents who get along. We have agreed to do what's best for them and put them first, and that's what we're doing."
   </blockquote>
   <h2>The Benefits</h2>
   <p>There are many benefits to making a co-parenting compromise like Helen and Scott have.</p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Less stress:</strong> When both parents are committed to a co-parenting arrangement, there is less stress for everyone involved, including the children.</li>
    <li><strong>Equal time with both parents:</strong> When custody is split 50/50, children get to see both of their parents on a regular basis, which is important for their emotional well-being.</li>
    <li><strong>Positive role models:</strong> When parents are able to put their differences aside and work together, they become positive role models for their children.</li>
    <li><strong>Less conflict:</strong> When parents are able to work together, there is less conflict overall, which benefits everyone, including the children.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>At the end of the day, co-parenting is all about putting your children first. When parents are able to work together and make compromises, it benefits everyone involved.</p>
   <p>So, whether you're going through a separation or you're already co-parenting, remember to keep your children's best interests in mind, communicate with your ex-partner, and be willing to make compromises.</p>
   <p>By doing so, you can create a positive co-parenting relationship that benefits everyone involved, especially your children.</p>
