   <p>It was a typical day in Telangana's Old City area when BJP leaders claimed that they had conducted a surgical strike against illegal Rohingya immigrants. However, their claims were met with skepticism and criticism from AIMIM (All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen) leader Asaduddin Owaisi.</p>
   <p>Owaisi, who has been the MP from Hyderabad since 2004, refuted these claims and accused the BJP of playing divisive politics to gain electoral mileage.</p>

   <p>The BJP's claims of conducting a surgical strike on illegal immigrants is not the first time they have resorted to such tactics. In 2016, they claimed to have conducted a surgical strike on terrorist camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).</p>
   <p>While the BJP received widespread praise for their actions, the veracity of their claims was later called into question by various media outlets and political parties.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, the BJP's recent claims of conducting a surgical strike in Old City were met with skepticism due to the lack of evidence and eyewitness accounts to support their claims.</p>

   <p>As someone who has lived in Hyderabad for most of my life, I have witnessed the divisive politics played by various political parties, including the BJP and AIMIM.</p>
   <p>It is disheartening to see politicians using issues related to religion and identity to polarize voters and gain electoral advantage. As a citizen, I strongly believe in the need for inclusive politics that addresses the concerns of all sections of society, regardless of their identity.</p>
