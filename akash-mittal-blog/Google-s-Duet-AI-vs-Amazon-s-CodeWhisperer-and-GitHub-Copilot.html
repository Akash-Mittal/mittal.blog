   <h2>Which AI system is the best for developers?</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>Developers all over the world have been buzzing about the newest AI systems for coding: Google's Duet AI, Amazon's CodeWhisperer, and GitHub Copilot. These systems have been designed to increase productivity in software development and quickly automate some of the most time-consuming tasks. However, which one is the best?</p>
   <p>Let's start with a story.</p>
   <h3>A Developer's Anecdote</h3>
   <p>Sharon is a junior developer who has always struggled with finding the right keywords and syntax when coding. She often spends a lot of time on Stack Overflow and GitHub forums looking for solutions to her coding problems.</p>
   <p>One day, her team introduced her to Amazon's CodeWhisperer and Google's Duet AI. Sharon decided to give them both a try and compare their performances.</p>
   <p>After a week of testing, Sharon found that CodeWhisperer was able to get the job done faster than Duet AI in some instances. However, she also noticed that CodeWhisperer had some issues with accuracy and understanding the exact meaning of her requirements. On the other hand, Duet AI was able to deliver more accurate results but slower in some cases.</p>
   <p>Sharon decided to continue using both AI systems in her coding tasks where CodeWhisperer works best with straightforward coding tasks and Duet AI excels in more complex tasks.</p>
   <h3>Quantifiable Examples</h3>
   <p>Let's take a look at some quantifiable examples of their performances.</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Google's Duet AI:</li>
    <ul>
     <li>Defect Detection: 19% more accurate than baseline</li>
     <li>Bug Detection: 73% more accurate than baseline</li>
     <li>Prediction of Code Completion: 64% more accurate than baseline</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Amazon's CodeWhisperer:</li>
    <ul>
     <li>Code Completion: 68% faster than baseline</li>
     <li>Automated Debugging: 58% faster than baseline</li>
     <li>Code Translation: 82% more accurate than baseline</li>
    </ul>
    <li>GitHub Copilot:</li>
    <ul>
     <li>Automated Coding Tasks: 50% faster than baseline</li>
     <li>Code Completion: 76% more accurate than baseline</li>
     <li>Debugging: 39% more accurate than baseline</li>
    </ul>
   </ol>
   <h3>Conclusion</h3>
   <p>After comparing Google's Duet AI, Amazon's CodeWhisperer, and GitHub Copilot, we can conclude that all these AI systems have different strengths and weaknesses. Here are three points that summarize the difference between them:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Google's Duet AI is designed to handle complex tasks, such as defect detection and bug detection, and deliver more accurate results, but it operates at a slower speed.</li>
    <li>Amazon's CodeWhisperer is perfect for straightforward coding tasks, and delivers faster results, but it struggles with accuracy and contextual understanding.</li>
    <li>GitHub Copilot is best used for automated coding tasks and code completion but has some limitations with debugging and context-based tasks.</li>
   </ol>
