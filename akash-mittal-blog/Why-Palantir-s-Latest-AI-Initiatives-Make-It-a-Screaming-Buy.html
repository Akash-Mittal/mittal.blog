  <p>Palantir Technologies is a software company that specializes in big data analysis and artificial intelligence. The company was founded in 2003 by a group of PayPal alumni and Stanford computer scientists, including Peter Thiel, who also co-founded PayPal. Palantir's platform allows organizations to analyze large amounts of data from various sources and make decisions based on that data.</p>
  <p>Palantir's latest AI initiatives are what I believe make it a screaming buy.</p>
  <h2>The story that led to Palantir's AI initiatives</h2>
  <p>Palantir got involved in AI when it began working with the US military. The company was tasked with building a system that could analyze the vast amounts of data produced by the military and provide insights to help with decision-making. The project was so successful that Palantir began applying the same technology to commercial enterprises, including financial institutions, healthcare providers, and insurance companies.</p>
  <p>Palantir recently announced two AI initiatives that will help the company build on its success in the field:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The development of Foundry AI: a platform that will enable developers to build powerful AI models quickly and easily. Foundry AI will be integrated with Palantir's existing Foundry platform, which allows companies to connect data from various sources and derive insights from it.</li>
   <li>The acquisition of two AI startups: Silk and Kimera Systems. Silk specializes in natural language processing, while Kimera Systems is working on a decentralized AI platform that can run on any device. The addition of these two startups will give Palantir access to cutting-edge AI technology and talent.</li>
  </ul>
