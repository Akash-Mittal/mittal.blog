   <h1>Top Five Cardinals Players of All Time: The Legends That Shaped a Team</h1> <img src="images/Top-Five-Cardinals-Players-of-All-Time-The-Legends-That-Shaped-a-Team.jpeg" alt="+Top-Five-Cardinals-Players-of-All-Time-The-Legends-That-Shaped-a-Team+">
   <p>As a die-hard Cardinals fan, I've seen some amazing players come and go. But there are a select few who stand out as true legends of the team. These players have not only set records and won championships, but they've also left an indelible mark on the hearts and minds of Cardinals fans everywhere. In this article, I'll be counting down the Top Five Cardinals Players of All Time.</p>
   <h2>Number 5: Stan Musial</h2>
   <p>Stan Musial is often referred to as "The Man", and for good reason. He played an unbelievable 22 seasons with the Cardinals, racking up a staggering 3,630 hits and 475 home runs. He was a 24-time All-Star and won three MVP awards, as well as three World Series championships. But perhaps what really set Musial apart was his humility and love for the game. He was beloved by fans, teammates and opponents alike, and his legacy is still felt throughout the Cardinals organization to this day.</p>
   <h2>Number 4: Ozzie Smith</h2>
   <p>To call Ozzie Smith a defensive wizard would be an understatement. He won 13 Gold Gloves over the course of his illustrious career, and his acrobatic plays in the field were simply jaw-dropping. But Smith wasn't just a great defender – he was also a key contributor on offense, hitting over .300 twice during his tenure with the Cardinals. And of course, who could forget his game-winning home run in Game 5 of the 1985 NLCS? Smith's flair and passion for the game made him a fan favorite, and we still get goosebumps watching his highlights to this day.</p>
   <h2>Number 3: Albert Pujols</h2>
   <p>Although Albert Pujols only spent 11 seasons with the Cardinals, he certainly made them count. During his time in St. Louis, he won three MVP awards, two Gold Gloves and helped the team win two World Series championships. Pujols was a true force to be reckoned with on offense, hitting over .300 nine times and smashing 445 home runs. But what really made Pujols stand out was his clutch performances in big moments – he hit some of the most memorable home runs in Cardinals history during his time with the team.</p>
   <h2>Number 2: Rogers Hornsby</h2>
   <p>Rogers Hornsby played for the Cardinals in the 1920s and 1930s, but his impact is still felt to this day. He was a two-time MVP, hitting over .400 three times and leading the league in batting average seven times. Hornsby was known for his laser-like focus on the game – he was once asked what he did during the offseason and famously replied, "I stare out the window and wait for spring." His intensity and drive made him a fearsome opponent and a beloved Cardinal.</p>
   <h2>Number 1: Bob Gibson</h2>
   <p>If you know anything about Cardinals history, you knew this was coming. Bob Gibson is not only the greatest Cardinal of all time, he's one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history. He spent his entire 17-year career with the Cardinals, winning two Cy Young awards and the 1968 MVP. Gibson holds a plethora of records, including the lowest ERA (1.12) in a single season. But it wasn't just his numbers that made Gibson great – it was his fiery personality and leadership on the field. He never backed down from a challenge, and his competitive spirit was truly inspiring.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>These five players are just a few of the legends who have donned a Cardinals uniform. But their impact on the team and the fans cannot be overstated. They set records, won championships and inspired generations of players and fans. And as we look to the future, we know that the Cardinals will continue to produce great players and make new memories. But for now, let's just sit back and appreciate the legends that shaped this team.</p>
