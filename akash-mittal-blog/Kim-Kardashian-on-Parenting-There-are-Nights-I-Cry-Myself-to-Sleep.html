   <h1>Kim Kardashian on Parenting: There are Nights I Cry Myself to Sleep</h1> <img src="images/Kim-Kardashian-on-Parenting-There-are-Nights-I-Cry-Myself-to-Sleep.jpeg" alt="+Kim-Kardashian-on-Parenting-There-are-Nights-I-Cry-Myself-to-Sleep+">
   <p>Kim Kardashian may be a multi-millionaire reality TV star, fashion icon, and social media influencer, but she's also a mother of four children. And like many parents, she has struggled with the challenges of raising children while managing her busy career and public persona.</p>
   <p>Recently, Kardashian opened up about the emotional toll that parenting has taken on her in a candid interview with <a href="#">People</a>. She admitted that there have been many nights when she has cried herself to sleep, feeling overwhelmed and exhausted by the demands of motherhood.</p>
   <p>"I think it's just a real thing that people go through," Kardashian said. "It's just really hard to understand until you really go through it yourself."</p>
   <p>Here are three key takeaways from Kardashian's interview:</p>
   <h2>1. Parenting is Challenging - Even for the Rich and Famous</h2>
   <p>Despite her immense wealth and fame, Kardashian still struggles with the same parenting challenges that many other parents face. She admits that she often feels guilty for spending too much time at work and not enough time with her children.</p>
   <blockquote class="quote">
    "I'm always just so busy, and I feel like I'm not doing enough," Kardashian said. "I always feel guilty."
   </blockquote>
   <p>She also acknowledges that parenting requires a lot of sacrifice, and that sometimes she has to put her own needs and desires aside for the sake of her children.</p>
   <h2>2. Self-Care is Essential for Parents</h2>
   <p>To cope with the stress of parenting, Kardashian emphasizes the importance of self-care. She says that she tries to take breaks whenever she can, whether that means taking a bath, going for a walk, or simply taking a few deep breaths.</p>
   <p>"I try to take care of myself so that I can be in a good headspace for my kids," she said.</p>
   <p>In addition to taking care of herself, Kardashian also makes time to spend with her husband, Kanye West, and to prioritize her own interests and passions.</p>
   <h2>3. Parenting is a Learning Process</h2>
   <p>For Kardashian, parenting is an ongoing learning process. She says that she has learned a lot from her own mother, Kris Jenner, and from watching other parents.</p>
   <p>She also tries to stay open-minded and flexible, knowing that every child is different and that what works for one may not work for another.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Parenting is challenging, even for the rich and famous</li>
    <li>Self-care is essential for parents</li>
    <li>Parenting is a learning process</li>
   </ul>
