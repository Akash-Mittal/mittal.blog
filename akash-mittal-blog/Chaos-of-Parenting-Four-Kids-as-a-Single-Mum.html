   <h2>The Start of it All</h2>
   <p>It all started in 2013 when Kim Kardashian and Kanye West welcomed their first child, North. Since then, they have expanded their family with the additions of Saint, Chicago, and Psalm. But what happens when you have four kids and your partner is not around to help?</p>
   <h2>The Reality of Being a Single Mother</h2>
   <p>According to Kim, "It's a lot, but when you have four kids, you just have to be really organized. You have to be super planned out and strategic." Being a single mother means she has to handle everything on her own from school drop-offs and pick-ups to meal planning and bedtime routines. It can be overwhelming, but Kim has learned to manage it with a few key strategies:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Having a schedule - Kim plans out every hour of the day to make sure nothing slips through the cracks.</li>
    <li>A support system - Kim relies on her family and assistants to help her with the day-to-day tasks.</li>
    <li>Taking breaks - Kim understands the importance of self-care and makes sure to schedule time for herself.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>The Chaos of Parenting Four Kids</h2>
   <p>With four kids comes a lot of chaos. Kim admits that she often feels like she's "running a daycare." But despite the challenges, she says that being a mother is "the most rewarding job." Here are some quantifiable examples of the chaos that comes with parenting four kids:</p>

    <li>Mess - Kids are messy, and with four of them, there's always something to clean up. Kim says that she's constantly picking up toys and cleaning up spills.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Practical Tips for Managing Chaos</h2>
   <p>Kim has learned a lot about managing chaos over the years. Here are some practical tips that she recommends:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Keep a to-do list - Writing down tasks can help you feel more organized and in control.</li>

    <li>Take time for yourself - Self-care is important for mental and emotional well-being.</li>

   </ul>
