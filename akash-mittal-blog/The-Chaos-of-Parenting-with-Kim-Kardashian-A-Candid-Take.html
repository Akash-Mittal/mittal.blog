    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>Kim Kardashian is no stranger to the spotlight. As a reality TV star, social media influencer, and business mogul, she's used to living her life in the public eye. But when it comes to parenting, Kardashian admits that the constant chaos and attention can make things especially challenging.</p>
    <p>In a recent interview with <em>People</em> magazine, Kardashian opened up about the ups and downs of raising her four children with husband Kanye West: North (7), Saint (5), Chicago (2), and Psalm (1).</p>
    <p>"It's a lot," she admitted. "But I think ultimately, seeing the happiness of my kids is what makes it all worth it."</p>
    <p>Despite the challenges, Kardashian says that she's learned to find joy in the little moments with her family.</p>
    <blockquote>
     "I try to make sure that we have quality time together as a family," she said. "Whether that's going to the park, having a family game night, or just cuddling on the couch and watching a movie. Those are the moments that matter."

    <p>So, what does parenting in the Kardashian-West household actually look like on a day-to-day basis? Here are a few quantifiable examples:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>According to Kardashian, her children love to cook with her in the kitchen. "We bake a lot of cookies together," she said. "It's messy, but it's fun."</li>
     <li>The family often takes vacations together, such as their recent trip to Wyoming. "Being in nature is really calming for all of us," Kardashian explained.</li>
     <li>Kardashian and West have also made a conscious effort to limit their kids' screen time. "We try to have a balance," Kardashian said. "We want them to experience the real world, not just the digital one."</li>
     <li>However, Kardashian acknowledges that her kids' exposure to social media is inevitable. "They know that Mommy has a job that involves being on Instagram and sharing photos," she said. "But we talk a lot about the difference between what's real and what's not."</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Overall, Kardashian says that she tries to stay present and soak up every moment with her family, despite the chaos. "I'm not perfect, and I make mistakes like every other parent," she said. "But I'm committed to being there for my kids no matter what."</p>
