  <p></p>
  <p>As the world continues to watch and speculate on a potential meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, the stage is set for an important gathering of foreign ministers from both nations in South Africa.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The meeting is being held under the auspices of the Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) bloc, which brings together some of the most important emerging economies in the world. However, as much as it is a gathering of economic and strategic partners, it is also an opportunity for both Russia and China to signal their intentions to the wider world.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Putin's possible appearance at the meeting has grabbed headlines and fueled speculation about the future of Russia's foreign policy, especially in relation to China. The Russian president, who has been facing increasing pressure from the West over alleged interference in the US election, could find himself forging an even deeper partnership with Beijing.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>At the same time, President Xi will be hoping to maintain China's economic influence in key areas while also assuring his partners that Beijing is committed to global cooperation and stability.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The growing partnership between Russia and China may be a cause for concern for many in the West. However, it is worth considering the positive impact that it could have on global affairs. Here are some quantifiable examples of how this partnership could benefit the world:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Increased economic cooperation</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Russia and China have been working to boost economic ties for several years now. In 2018, the two countries announced plans to increase bilateral trade to $200 billion by 2024. This ambitious target is achievable due to the various infrastructure projects that are being planned by both countries.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Projects such as China's Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to connect Asia, Europe, and Africa through enhanced infrastructure, could greatly benefit Russia's own development plans. For instance, the Northern Sea Route, which will provide a new shipping route between Europe and Asia, could be a game-changer for Russia's economy and trade relationships.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Greater strategic cooperation</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Both Russia and China have long-standing territorial disputes with countries such as Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. However, their growing cooperation could help to stabilize these tensions and reduce the chances of conflict in the region. Moreover, a stronger partnership between Russia and China could provide a counter-balance to the influence of the United States.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Increased cooperation on global issues</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Both Russia and China have expressed their commitment to international cooperation and multilateralism. By working together, they could help to resolve many of the pressing global issues facing the world.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>For instance, the ongoing crisis in Syria could be resolved through joint efforts from Russia and China. Both countries have already played important roles in mediating the conflict. If they continue to work together, they could bring an end to one of the most brutal conflicts of our time.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion:</p>
  <p>In conclusion, the gathering of foreign ministers from Russia and China in South Africa could be an important step towards strengthening the partnership between the two countries. Increased economic cooperation, greater strategic cooperation, and a commitment to solving global problems are just a few of the benefits that could result from this growing partnership.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Personal anecdotes:</p>
  <p>I recently met a Russian diplomat who was eager to discuss the country's relationship with China. He saw the growing partnership between the two nations as an opportunity to create a new world order, one that would be more just and equitable. He spoke of the importance of working together towards common goals, and the need to find solutions to issues such as climate change and terrorism.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This conversation made me realize that the growing partnership between Russia and China could be an important step towards creating a more peaceful world. By working together, they could help to resolve many of the pressing issues facing the world, and create a new paradigm for global cooperation.</p>
