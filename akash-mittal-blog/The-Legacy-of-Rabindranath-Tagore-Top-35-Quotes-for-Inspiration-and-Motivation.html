  <p>There was a time when India was under British rule, and the cultural traditions of the country were being lost. But Rabindranath Tagore, the famous poet, playwright, and novelist, decided to do something about it. He wrote a number of books and plays that helped to preserve India's rich artistic heritage, and his work has inspired people all over the world.</p>
  <p>Here are some of Tagore's most inspiring quotes:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>"Let your life lightly dance on the edges of Time like dew on the tip of a leaf."</li>
   <li>"The highest education is that which does not merely give us information but makes our life in harmony with all existence."</li>
   <li>"You can't cross the sea merely by standing and staring at the water."</li>
   <li>"Faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark."</li>
   <li>"Clouds come floating into my life, no longer to carry rain or usher storm, but to add color to my sunset sky."</li>
   <li>"The butterfly counts not months but moments, and has time enough."</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Tagore's words have inspired not just individuals, but also some of the most successful companies in the world. For example:</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> has always been known for its innovative products, and its founder Steve Jobs was a big fan of Tagore's work. He once quoted Tagore in a speech, saying "You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future."</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a> is another company that has been influenced by Tagore's philosophy. The company has a motto, "Don't be evil," which is based on the idea of doing good for society as a whole. This attitude is very much in line with Tagore's belief that we should strive to live in harmony with all existence.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> is yet another company that has been inspired by Tagore's work. The social network has a mission to make the world more open and connected, and to build communities that are based on trust and respect. This is very much in line with Tagore's belief that we must work to build bridges between people and cultures.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, Tagore's legacy lives on in the words and deeds of millions of people around the world. His philosophy of harmony and respect for all existence continues to inspire us to this day. Whether you are looking for advice on how to live a more fulfilling life, or simply need some inspiration to get through a difficult day, Tagore's wisdom will never let you down.</p>
