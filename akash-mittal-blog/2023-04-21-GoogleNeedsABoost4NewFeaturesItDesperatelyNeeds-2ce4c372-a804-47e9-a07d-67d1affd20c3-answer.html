   <p>As a daily user of Google, there have been times when I wished certain features were available. Let's say I am at a game and I see a player I can't put a name to. It's a frustrating experience. After looking around, the people near me have no idea who he is. There should be an easy way to find out who that person is. Google needs to add this feature and several others to make our search experience much smoother.</p>
  </section><!--Example-->
  <section>
   <h2>New Features that Google Needs</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>An image search that doesn't require a keyword: If you have an image, but don't know how to describe it in words, it can be a challenge to find what you're looking for. Google should have a feature where you can upload the image and let the search engine find the results.</li>
    <li>Language translation with a single tap: In many cases we come across content written in languages we can't understand. Google Translate helps, but what if there was a way to get translations with a single tap? Imagine visiting a foreign country and seeing a sign you can't decipher. If this feature was available, it would make our lives easier.</li>
    <li>Related questions filtering: If you've ever Googled a question, you know how many different results come up. It would be great if we could filter the results to only see the questions that are relevant to us.</li>
    <li>Quick identification of famous people: Let's go back to the sports game scenario. Wouldn't it be great if you could snap a picture of the player and Google could identify them within seconds? No more guessing or asking around, Google would simply provide the answer.</li>
   </ol>
  </section><!--Conclusion in 3 points-->
  <section>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>As can be seen from the examples mentioned above, Google needs to incorporate these features to enhance our search experience. The following are the main points to take away:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>A picture search feature would make it easier to find what users are looking for.</li>
    <li>A language translation feature would make international experiences more accessible.</li>
    <li>A quick identification feature would make it faster and easier to find information.</li>
   </ol>
