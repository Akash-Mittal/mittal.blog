    <p>Imagine a world where machines make decisions that affect our daily lives without any human intervention. Sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie, right? But this scenario is becoming increasingly real as artificial intelligence (AI) continues to advance at breakneck speed. Concerned about the risks associated with the unregulated use of AI, the European Union (EU) has recently passed a draft of the AI Act, which aims to ensure the responsible and ethical use of this powerful technology.</p>
   </section>
   <section id="examples">
    <p>Real-life examples of the harmful effects of unregulated AI abound. The most well-known case is that of Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal, where the social media giant collected and misused personal data to influence the 2016 US presidential election. Another example is the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement agencies, which has been shown to be racially biased and therefore discriminatory. The AI Act will address these and other issues by implementing strict regulations on the use of AI.</p>

   <section id="companies">
    <p>The tech industry will be most affected by the AI Act, as it includes some of the biggest players in the field. Google, Microsoft, and Amazon are all heavily invested in AI research and development, and will need to comply with the new regulations. These companies have already responded positively to the AI Act, with Google's director of public policy stating that the company supports "the shared goal of ensuring that AI is developed and used responsibly and ethically."</p>
    <p>Other companies, such as Facebook and Apple, have yet to comment on the AI Act, but are likely to be impacted as well. The regulation covers all organizations that use AI systems, regardless of their size or location.</p>
