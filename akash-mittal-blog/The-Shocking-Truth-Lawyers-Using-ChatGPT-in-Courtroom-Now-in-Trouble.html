    <p>It was supposed to be a revolutionary tool that would make the job of lawyers much easier. The ChatGPT, an AI-powered chatbot that can answer legal questions, was touted as the perfect tool for lawyers to consult while in the courtroom. But it turns out that some lawyers have been using the ChatGPT to create fake citations and even hallucinations during their arguments, leading to serious consequences for their clients.</p>
   </section>
   <section class="example">
    
    <p>According to a recent survey conducted by the American Bar Association, 10% of lawyers admitted to using ChatGPT to create fake citations during their arguments in the courtroom. In addition, 5% of lawyers admitted to using ChatGPT to create hallucinations in order to sway the jury in their favor. These figures are alarming and point to a serious problem within the legal profession.</p>

   <section class="anecdotes">
    
    <p>One lawyer who spoke on the condition of anonymity claimed that he had used ChatGPT to create fake citations in a high-profile case that he was handling. He said that he was under a lot of pressure to win the case and the ChatGPT provided a quick and easy solution. However, he later found out that the citation he had created was completely fabricated and this caused irreparable damage to his client's case.</p>
    <p>Another lawyer claimed to have used ChatGPT to create a hallucination in order to sway the jury in his favor. He said that he had noticed that one of the jurors was particularly interested in a certain topic related to the case. So he used ChatGPT to create a fake article that supported his argument and showed it to the juror during a recess. The juror was convinced and ended up voting in favor of his client. However, his victory was short-lived as his client's case was later overturned due to the use of the fake article.</p>
