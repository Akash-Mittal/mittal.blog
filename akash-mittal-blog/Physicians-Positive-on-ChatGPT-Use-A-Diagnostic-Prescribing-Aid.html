    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>Dr. Jameson, a busy family physician, was struggling to keep up with the influx of patients he was seeing each day at his clinic.

    <h2>Critical Comments</h2>
    <p>While many physicians find ChatGPT to be a useful tool, there are still some concerns about its use as a diagnostic prescribing aid. Some of the critical comments include:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>ChatGPT cannot replace the expertise of a human physician.</li>
     <li>ChatGPT may not always provide accurate recommendations.</li>
     <li>ChatGPT may be biased in its recommendations based on the data it has been trained on.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Despite these concerns, many physicians believe that ChatGPT can be a valuable tool in their daily workflows as long as it is used as a supplement to their medical expertise.</p>
