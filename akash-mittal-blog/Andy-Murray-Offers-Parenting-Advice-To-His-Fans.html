   <p>Murray also stressed the importance of communication and honesty in parenting. He tries to be open and honest with his daughters, even when the truth may be difficult to hear.

   </blockquote>
   <p>Murray also shared a touching story about his own upbringing, saying that his mother always encouraged him to pursue his dreams:</p>
   <blockquote>
    "My mom was always really supportive of me, even when I wanted to pursue tennis instead of school. She always told me I could do anything I set my mind to, and that's something I want to pass on to my own children."
   </blockquote>
