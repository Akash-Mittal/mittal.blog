   <p>Once upon a time, there was a team of data scientists who wanted to measure the performance of their machine learning models on a wide range of datasets. They spent months collecting and preprocessing data, designing algorithms, and tuning hyperparameters, but they had no way of knowing how their models would perform in real-world situations. That's when they discovered DataPerf's annual benchmarking challenges, which would allow them to compare their models to those of other researchers and test their generalization capabilities on new datasets.</p>
   <p>For the last few years, DataPerf has been organizing benchmarking challenges for various domains, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and recommender systems. These challenges involve large and diverse datasets, standardized evaluation metrics, and leaderboard rankings, which enable researchers to benchmark their models and showcase their achievements to the community.</p>
   <p>For example, in the recent image recognition challenge, participants were given a dataset of over 1.5 million labeled images, which included various objects, scenes, and actions. The goal was to train a model that could accurately classify the images into one of a thousand categories. The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 96.5%, which surpassed the previous state-of-the-art results and demonstrated the power of deep learning architectures.</p>

   <h2>The Advantages of Data-centric ML Benchmarking</h2>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>Objective and Reproducible Metrics:</strong> By using standardized metrics, such as accuracy, F1 score, or AUC, benchmarking challenges ensure that all participants are evaluated on the same basis and that their results can be verified and reproduced by others. This helps to reduce the subjectivity and bias that may arise from using different evaluation criteria or test sets.</li>
    <li><strong>Real-world Relevance and Diversity:</strong> Benchmarking challenges aim to capture the complexity and diversity of real-world scenarios by providing large and diverse datasets that contain various types of data, such as text, image, audio, or graph, and cover different domains, such as healthcare, finance, or social media. This enables researchers to develop models that are more robust, generalizable, and applicable to different domains and contexts.</li>
    <li><strong>Collaboration and Innovation:</strong> Benchmarking challenges foster collaboration and innovation among researchers by providing a platform where they can share their models, methods, and ideas, and learn from each other's successes and failures. This leads to the creation of new benchmarks, techniques, and insights that can advance the field of machine learning and benefit society as a whole.</li>
