    <h2>An Interesting Story: How AI Changed the Game for Starbucks</h2>
    <p>Imagine you're a regular at Starbucks, and the barista knows you by name and your usual order. Now, imagine that same level of personalization, but with artificial intelligence. That's exactly what Starbucks did when they implemented their AI-powered ordering system.</p>
    <p>The system uses data from the Starbucks Rewards program to make recommendations based on a customer's buying habits and preferences. It's so effective that it's been responsible for up to 30% of Starbucks' total sales.</p>
    <p>Starbucks is just one example of how artificial intelligence is disrupting traditional business models and revolutionizing the way we interact with companies.</p>
