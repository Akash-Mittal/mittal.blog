    <p>As a parent, it's not uncommon to feel guilty for missing milestones or important moments in your child's life due to work or other commitments. However, just because you're not physically present doesn't mean you can't still form a strong connection with your child.</p>
    <h2>Anecdote</h2>
    <p>One of our Dad University members, Rob, shared with us how he maintains a connection with his son, even though he's often traveling for work. Rob would make it a point to FaceTime with his son every night before bed and read him a bedtime story. He also sends care packages with small trinkets and letters inside to let his son know he's thinking of him. Despite the distance, Rob's son knows that his father loves and cares for him.</p>
    
    <p>According to a study by the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the quality of parent-child communication predicts academic success, mental health, and social competence in children. This means that keeping the lines of communication open, even when physically apart, can have a significant impact on your child's well-being.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, a study by the Center for Parent and Teen Communication found that over 60% of teenagers wish they could spend more time talking to their parents. By making time for regular communication, even when not physically present, parents can help meet this desire and build a stronger relationship with their children.</p>
