   <p>It was a quiet evening in the suburban neighborhood of Raleigh, North Carolina when gunfire broke out, leaving two young children, ages 6 and 3, injured along with their babysitter.</p>
   <p>The babysitter, who has not been identified, was watching over the children while their parents were out for the evening. Details of the shooting are still under investigation, but it is believed that the shooter was targeting someone else in the area and the children and babysitter were caught in the crossfire.</p>
   <p>Emergency services were quick to respond, rushing the children and the babysitter to a nearby hospital. While their condition is currently unknown, authorities have stated that their injuries are not life-threatening.</p>

     <h3>Shooting Incidents on the Rise in Suburban Neighborhoods</h3>
     <p>While mass shootings often make headlines, many people are unaware of the increasing number of shootings that are taking place in suburban neighborhoods across the country. In fact, a recent study found that suburban areas are now more likely to experience a shooting than urban areas.</p>
     <p>These incidents can happen anywhere, at any time, and to anyone. It is crucial that communities come together to ensure that they are taking steps to prevent gun violence and protect the safety and wellbeing of their residents.</p>
