   <p>Have you ever wondered about the ownership of your data on the internet?</p>
   <p>Let me tell you the story of Mark, a freelance content creator, who used to publish his articles on Medium, a popular blogging platform.</p>
   <p>One day, Mark received an email stating that his account has been suspended due to some violation of terms and conditions. Mark was shocked as he had not violated any rules. He tried to contact the support team but received no response. Moreover, he realized that all of his articles were deleted from the platform without any prior notice. Mark lost all his hard work and his readership because of a centralized authority's decision.</p>
   <p>Mark's story is not unique as many creators have faced a similar fate on centralized platforms. However, the solution to this problem lies in decentralization and Web3 technology, which ensures user rights and ownership of their data.</p>
   <p>Substack and Inrupt are two innovative companies that are taking steps towards user empowerment and data ownership.</p>
   <h2>Substack</h2>
   <p>Substack is a subscription-based newsletter platform that allows writers to monetize their content and own their audience. Recently, they announced the introduction of a new feature called "Ghost", which enables writers to move their Substack newsletter to their domain name, without losing subscribers or email history. This feature enhances portability, ownership, and reduces the dependency on Substack platform. Furthermore, Substack has pledged to support writers' legal defense if they face lawsuits or legal challenges due to their content.</p>
   <h2>Inrupt</h2>
   <p>Inrupt is a decentralized web platform, founded by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web. Their mission is to give users control of their data and digital life by providing decentralized applications that work with multiple platforms. Inrupt's Solid framework enables users to store their data in a secure and decentralized manner, reducing their reliance on centralized entities, and enhances their data privacy.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>The initiatives by Substack and Inrupt demonstrate that companies are well aware of the importance of Web3 and decentralized technologies. However, the adoption of Web3 by the masses is still a challenge due to the lack of education, accessibility, and user-friendly interfaces. It is crucial to emphasize the importance of Web3 and educate the masses about its benefits, which can enhance user empowerment and data privacy.</p>
