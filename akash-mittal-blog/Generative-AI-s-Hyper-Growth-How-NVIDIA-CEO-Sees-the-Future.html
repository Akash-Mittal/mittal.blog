  <p>Imagine being able to go back in time and have a conversation with your past self, to advise on what skills you should learn to stay relevant in the future. One of the answers you might receive is that you should become invested in the world of Generative AI.<br><br>
    Why? Because it's predicted to grow enormously in the coming years, and already today, it is revolutionizing how we think about industries ranging from entertainment to healthcare. In this article, we'll explore the viewpoints of NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang on the hyper-growth of generative AI and how it is expected to change the world as we know it.<br><br></p>
  <h2> Generative AI's Growth</h2>
  <p>Before we dive into the world of generative AI from Jensen Huang's perspective, let's look at some quantifiable examples of its growth:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>It is predicted that the global market for generative AI will grow to $4.5 billion by 2023, with a CAGR of 20.7% from 2018 to 2023.</li>
   <li>In 2020, NVIDIA launched its A100 GPU, which is the world's most powerful accelerator for training and running AI models. The A100 is 20 times faster than its previous version and has made it possible for researchers to train more complex and larger AI models rapidly.</li>
   <li>Generative AI is helping the gaming and entertainment industry to revolutionize their content creation method. For example, in 2020, Fortnite created the Neymar Jr. skin using generative AI.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Anecdotal Case Study: Healthcare</h2>
  <p>The healthcare sector is one of the primary beneficiaries of generative AI. It is helping doctors to analyze patient data more efficiently, enabling researchers to develop new drugs at faster rates and providing more accurate diagnosis. Let's consider an anecdotal case study:</p>
  <p>Imagine a doctor being able to anticipate an ICU patient going into septic shock because of generative AI prediction models. The technology can enable early interventions and save lives. This is precisely what is now possible at Virginia-based Sentara Healthcare. The healthcare company partnered with NVIDIA to develop AI models that can analyze reams of ICU patient data, predict patient outcomes, and alert doctors of impending medical crises.</p>
  <h2>Personal Involvement in Generative AI</h2>
  <p>Earlier this year, Jensen Huang announced a personal project, Omniverse Machinima, which is a tool that enables filmmakers and gamers to create cinematic experiences using real-time rendering technology. It is a perfect example of how generative AI is changing the entertainment industry.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion: Jensen Huang's Vision for Generative AI's Future</h2>
  <p>Jensen Huang envisions that generative AI will open up new possibilities and enable the creation of things that are currently unimaginable. Here are three key points to sum up his vision:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Generative AI will unlock innovation in various sectors, from healthcare to entertainment.</li>
   <li>Generative AI will continue to spark the development of new hardware and software, such as the technology behind the NVIDIA A100.</li>
   <li>Generative AI will fundamentally change the way we work and interact with technology, creating new job opportunities and potentials.</li>
  </ul>
