    <h2>The Story of Sunita</h2>
    <p>Sunita was eagerly awaiting the birth of her first child. When she heard the cries of her newborn baby girl, she was overjoyed. But that joy was short-lived. When her in-laws came to visit, their first question was, "Why didn't you have a boy?"</p>
    <p>Over the years, Sunita has heard it all. From comments about her daughter's looks and personality to questions about why she hasn't produced a son yet. It's enough to make any parent feel helpless.</p>
    <p>But Sunita is determined to break the cycle.</p>
    
    <p>According to a 2018 report by the United Nations, India has one of the highest rates of female infanticide and gender selective abortions in the world. Additionally, a study by Plan International India found that 47% of Indian girls marry before the age of 18 and 30% of girls drop out of school before the age of 10.</p>
    <h2>The Need for Change</h2>
    <p>The negative comments and attitudes towards girls in India have far-reaching consequences. Not only do they perpetuate harmful gender stereotypes, but they also contribute to a culture of violence against women. It's time for parents, families, and communities to change their views and embrace the value of all children, regardless of gender.</p>
    <h2>Practical Tips for Parents</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>Encourage your daughters to pursue their interests and dreams, whether that means playing sports or studying science.</li>
     <li>Avoid making negative comments about your daughter's appearance or personality. Focus on building her confidence and self-esteem.</li>
     <li>Stay involved in your daughter's life and support her in all of her endeavors. Let her know that you believe in her and her potential.</li>
