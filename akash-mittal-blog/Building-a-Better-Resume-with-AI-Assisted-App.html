   <p>As a recent college graduate, Sarah was excited to start her job search. She spent hours crafting and perfecting her resume, trying to highlight her education, experience, and skills. However, despite her efforts, she was not getting any responses from potential employers. She felt discouraged and frustrated, wondering what she was doing wrong.</p>
   <p>Then, Sarah discovered an AI-assisted app that helped her analyze her resume and identify areas for improvement. The app suggested specific keywords and phrases to include, as well as formatting and layout changes to make her resume more visually appealing. With the app's help, Sarah was able to create a stronger and more effective resume, which resulted in multiple job offers from top companies.</p>
   
   <p>According to a survey by CareerBuilder, 58% of employers reported that they have spotted a lie on a resume. Furthermore, 33% said they spend only a few seconds reviewing a resume before deciding if it belongs in the "yes" or "no" pile.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, using an AI-assisted app to improve your resume can increase your chances of getting hired by up to 50%, according to Zety. This is because the app can help you tailor your resume to the specific job and industry you are applying for, identify and correct errors or inconsistencies, and highlight your strengths and accomplishments.</p>
