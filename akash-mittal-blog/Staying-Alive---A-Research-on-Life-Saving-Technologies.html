   <h2>An Unexpected Encounter</h2>
   <p>It was a beautiful day for hiking in the mountains. I had packed my backpack with all the necessary gears and set out early in the morning. As I was trekking through a forest path, I suddenly heard someone screaming for help. I instinctively rushed towards the scream and found a hiker clinging to a cliff. It was a life threatening situation as the hiker was losing grip and slipping down. Fortunately, I had my smartphone with me and quickly called for help. The emergency responders arrived promptly, equipped with life saving technologies such as GPS, oxygen masks and first aid kits. They were able to rescue the hiker using a rope system and the life saving technologies.</p>

   <h2>Real Life Examples</h2>
   <p>Life saving technologies are not just limited to emergency responders. There are many companies that are developing and using innovative technologies to save lives. One such example is Tesla, which has introduced many safety features in their electric cars such as Autopilot, which can automatically steer a car on the highway, reduce speed and apply brakes in emergency situations. Another example is the smartwatch manufacturer, Apple, which includes a heart rate monitor and an ECG feature in their watches.</p>
   <p>Medical technologies are also playing a significant role in saving lives. Companies such as Medtronic, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Philips are developing medical devices such as implants, pacemakers, defibrillators and monitors which are helping doctors to diagnose and treat diseases more effectively.</p>
