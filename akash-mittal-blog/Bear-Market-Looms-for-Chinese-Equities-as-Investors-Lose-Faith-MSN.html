    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>It was early morning on a Monday when the news hit the headlines- the Chinese stock market is heading towards a bear market as investors lose faith in the Equities. The Shanghai Composite index fell to a new low as tech giants listed in the exchange, like Tencent and Alibaba, lost significant ground in the last few weeks. While the government is trying to ease concerns, investors are skeptical about the future of the Chinese economy.</p>
    
    <p>The Shanghai Composite index has fallen by more than 12.5% since the beginning of the year, wiping out more than $700 billion from the market capitalization of Chinese equities. In comparison, the S&amp;P500 index in the US has only lost 2.4% during the same period. Additionally, major tech companies like Tencent and Alibaba have lost more than 20% of their value, while smaller companies have suffered even more significant losses.</p>
