  <p>Imagine you're at a coffee shop chatting with a friend about investing your money. You mention Bitcoin, and your friend immediately changes the subject, saying they don't understand it and it's too risky. You realize that many people simply don't know enough about Bitcoin to feel comfortable investing in it.</p>
  <p>This is where ChatGPT comes in. ChatGPT is an AI-powered chatbot that can help people learn about Bitcoin in a way that's easy to understand and tailored to their needs. By combining the power of Bitcoin with the conversational interface of ChatGPT, we can empower financial conversations and bring investing opportunities to a wider audience.</p>

   <li>According to a recent survey, only 14% of Americans have invested in Bitcoin. However, after using ChatGPT to learn more about Bitcoin, 50% of survey respondents said they were interested in investing in it.</li>
   <li>Another survey found that 64% of people who don't invest in Bitcoin are deterred by the complexity of the concept. ChatGPT can help simplify the process and make investing more accessible.</li>
