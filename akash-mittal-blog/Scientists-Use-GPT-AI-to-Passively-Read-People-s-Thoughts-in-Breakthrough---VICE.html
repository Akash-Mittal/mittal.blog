    <p>Have you ever wanted to know what someone else is thinking? Well, now scientists have developed an AI that can do just that.</p>
    <p>According to a recent article by <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7jjeq/scientists-use-gpt-ai-to-passively-read-peoples-thoughts-in-breakthrough" target="_blank">VICE</a>, researchers from the University of Helsinki, Finland and the University of Copenhagen, Denmark have developed an AI system GPT-3 that can passively read people's thoughts based on electroencephalography (EEG) readings.</p>
    <p>Through this breakthrough development, the AI can analyze the magnetic activity of a person's brain, decode it into meaningful language and interpret it as comprehensible text. The scientists have emphasized the non-invasive nature of the system since it can passively read the person's thoughts without their knowledge or consent.</p>

    <h2>Real Life Examples</h2>
    <p>This technological advancement has significant implications in various fields that require monitoring of people's thoughts and emotions. For instance, in the mental health sector, doctors can use the AI to identify the mood patterns of patients with conditions such as depression or anxiety. In the marketing industry, the AI can ascertain the reactions of consumers to advertisements or products to tailor them accordingly. In the education sector, educators could use the AI to measure the engagement levels of students during class.</p>
    <p>Finnish software company, Valossa, is one of the companies interested in using this technology. They seek to apply the AI system to the entertainment industry by providing analytics on the audience's reactions to movies and television shows.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion &amp; Critical Comments</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>This AI system is a significant breakthrough in the field of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, and the possibilities are endless.</li>
     <li>The use of such technology also raises ethical concerns, particularly on the privacy of individuals whose thoughts could be passively read without their knowledge or consent. It is essential to enforce strict laws and regulations on the use and storage of the data collected.</li>
     <li>Companies and industries interested in using this technology should work with the scientific and legal communities to ensure ethical and appropriate use and prevent potential abuses of the system.</li>
