  <p> Parenting Phases: How a Holy Missionary and 4 Words Can Help You Navigate</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Introduction:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Parenting isn't easy; it comes with a plethora of stages and phases that demand constant attention, patience, and love. As much as we all adore our children, it can be overwhelming to navigate through routines, emotions, and new challenges that arise with each passing day. When things get tough, we often look for guidance to find our way back to the right track - and when it comes to parenting, a holy missionary and four words can be a lifesaver. Let's dive in!</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Story:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>I first heard about the four words from Father Andrew, a missionary who helped start a school in a rural community in Tanzania. The school was run by the local community and provided education, meals, and a safe haven for children who otherwise wouldn't have had these opportunities. He shared the four words he often used with parents and caregivers when they felt lost, overwhelmed, or stuck: "It's just a phase".</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>At first, I didn't think much of it, but over the years, I realized how powerful these four words can be. Whether we're dealing with sleepless nights, tantrums, picky eaters, or teenage rebellion, it's essential to remember that every phase does pass, and as parents, we can help our children navigate through these stages with love, patience, and understanding.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable Examples:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>According to a survey conducted by The National Child Traumatic Stress Network, nearly 60% of children aged 8-16 reported experiencing a traumatic event, such as the death of a loved one, a divorce, or a severe illness. These events can have a significant impact on a child's emotional well-being, so it's crucial to recognize when our child needs professional help. However, in most cases, when children act out, show signs of anxiety, or other behavioral issues, it's just a phase. As parents, we can provide a safe and loving environment, help our children express their feelings, and seek out support if needed.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another quantifiable example is the increase in screen time and digital use among children. According to research by the American Academy of Pediatrics, children spend an average of 7 hours a day in front of screens. This can have adverse effects on their physical and mental health and development. As parents, we can set healthy boundaries, encourage outdoor activities, and provide alternatives that promote creativity and socialization instead of passive entertainment.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, parenting is a journey full of ups and downs, twists and turns, and new challenges that demand our constant attention and love. However, with the help of a holy missionary and the four words "It's just a phase," we can approach each experience with a sense of perspective and calmness, knowing that every stage does pass. As parents, we can provide a loving and supportive environment, seek out resources and support when needed, and be compassionate and patient with ourselves and our children.</p>

  <p>:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>When my son was going through a phase of waking up multiple times during the night, the four words "It's just a phase" helped me stay calm and remind myself that this too shall pass. Instead of feeling frustrated or overwhelmed, I approached each wake-up as an opportunity to soothe and comfort him, knowing that he would eventually grow out of this phase.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Case Studies:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Maria, a single mother of two, struggled with her son's angry outbursts and defiance. She felt helpless and didn't know where to turn for help. After hearing the four words "It's just a phase" from a friend, Maria approached each incident with more patience and understanding. She also sought out counseling and therapy, which helped both her and her son develop tools to manage his emotions and behavior.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Practical Tips:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>- Create a routine: Establish a predictable and consistent routine that includes regular sleep, meal, and play times.</p>
  <p>- Practice empathy: Try to see things from your child's perspective and show compassion and understanding when they're struggling.</p>
  <p>- Seek out support: Whether it's a trusted friend, therapist, or parenting support group, don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it.</p>
