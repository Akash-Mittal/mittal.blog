He decides to invest $100 each in Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, and Stellar. CoinSwitch also offers a portfolio management service, which allows John to track his investments and see how they perform.</p>
     <p>Another example is Sarah, who has a lot of crypto coins but doesn't know what to do with them. She wants to earn some passive income, so she turns to CoinSwitch's lending service. She can lend her coins to other traders who need them, earning interest on her loans.</p>
