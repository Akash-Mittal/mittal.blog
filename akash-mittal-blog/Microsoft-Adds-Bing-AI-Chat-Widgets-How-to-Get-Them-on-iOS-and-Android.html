    <h2>How it Works</h2>
    <p>The Bing AI chat widget is available for iOS and Android users in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, India, and New Zealand. To get started, you simply need to open up your chat app (which supports the Bing AI chat widget) and start a conversation.

Once you have found the answer that you were looking for, you can then share it with your chat partner by tapping on the share icon.</p>
    <p>The Bing AI chat widget incorporates not just web search, but also image search and video search, which gives users a wide range of options for finding the information they need. And with the chat window still active, you can quickly switch back to the conversation and share your findings with your chat partner. Additionally, Microsoft's chat widgets are designed to work seamlessly on the lock screen, which allows users to access the chat feature without having to unlock their device or navigate away from their current task.</p>
