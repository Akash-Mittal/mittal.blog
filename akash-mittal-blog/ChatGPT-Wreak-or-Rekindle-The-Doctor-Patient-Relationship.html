     <p>It's 7 pm and John, a 30-year-old software engineer, is feeling uneasy. He's experiencing blurred vision and severe headache. However, he knows that it's impossible to book an appointment with his family doctor at this hour.</p>
     <p>That's when he remembers an app his friend told him about --- ChatGPT. He downloads the app and within minutes, he's connected to a licensed doctor through the app's chat feature. The doctor recommends some immediate medicinal remedies and schedules John's visit to the clinic.</p>
     <p>ChatGPT is slowly but surely changing the dynamics of the doctor-patient relationship. The platform facilitates a virtual consultation with a medical professional through its app. With only a few clicks, patients are connected to an experienced doctor who provides medical consultation for a fee.</p>
     <p>However, the virtual consultation platform has sparked heated debates among medical professionals with some arguing that the digital interface will significantly affect the medical industry's fundamental values.</p>
     <h2>Real-Life Applications</h2>
     <p>Companies in the telemedicine industry have been booming since the COVID-19 pandemic. Teladoc Health is a prime example of a company capitalizing on the pandemic's restriction on human interaction. Teladoc offers a similar service to ChatGPT, providing patients access to medical professionals through a digital interface.</p>
     <p>Another company that has recently entered the telemedicine space is Amazon. The multinational e-commerce platform launched Amazon Care, which provides virtual medical consultation to employees in the Seattle area. Amazon aims to make health care service more accessible to working individuals.</p>
     <h2>Conclusion</h2>
     <p>The virtual consultation industry is growing rapidly, and so is the debate around its benefit to the medical industry. ChatGPT, Teladoc, and Amazon Care are only a few examples of companies disrupting the traditional mode of medical care. Nevertheless, it is essential to understand the industry's impact on the doctor-patient relationship and overall medical ethics.</p>
     <h3>Critical Comments:</h3>
     <ol>
      <li>While virtual consultations are convenient, medical professionals must tackle the ethical concerns regarding online prescriptions.</li>
      <li>Medical professionals must also address the digital divide that may prevent low-income patients from accessing these virtual consultation platforms.</li>
      <li>The virtual consultation space is a booming industry; however, patients must be aware of the limitations of online medical consultation and learn when a personal visit is necessary.</li>
