   <p>The lack of oversight poses a threat to privacy and security</p>
  </header>
  <main class="main">
   <p>It was a typical Tuesday morning when Sophie got a call from her bank informing her of some unusual activity on her account. "Did you authorize a payment of $1,000 to a travel agency in Greece?" the representative asked. Sophie was confused. She had never been to Greece and certainly hadn't made any travel arrangements. She quickly realized that her online banking password had been hacked and the thief had used artificial intelligence to replicate her online behavior and make the transaction appear legitimate.</p>
   <p>Stories like Sophie's are becoming increasingly common as artificial intelligence continues to advance and threaten our privacy and security. Yet, unlike many other countries, Canada has been slow to regulate the use of AI.</p>
   <h2>The Urgency for Action</h2>
   <p>According to a recent study by the Brookfield Institute for Innovation + Entrepreneurship, Canada is falling behind in AI development, especially in areas of governance and ethics. The lack of regulatory oversight means that companies are free to use AI in any way they see fit, potentially endangering individuals and society as a whole.</p>
   <p>But it's not just a question of safety. The unregulated development of AI also has economic consequences. Without proper governance, Canada risks losing its competitive edge in the global marketplace.</p>
   <p>Already, some foreign investors are hesitant to do business in Canada due to the lack of clarity around AI regulation. In order to attract and retain AI talent and investment, Canada must take swift action to put a regulatory framework in place.</p>
   <h2>Examples of the Impacts of AI</h2>
   <p>The lack of AI regulation in Canada is not just a theoretical concern. There have already been cases where AI has been used to harm individuals and violate their privacy.</p>
   <p>For example, in 2018, the Toronto Police Service was found to be using a controversial AI-powered technology called "PredPol" to predict and target crime. However, the tool was found to be biased against certain communities, and the police department was forced to apologize and abandon its use of the technology.</p>
   <p>Similarly, in 2019, the Canadian government was forced to suspend the use of an AI algorithm in its immigration system after it was found to discriminate against certain groups of people, including women and minorities.</p>
   <p>These examples show the urgent need for regulatory oversight of AI in Canada. Without proper guidelines in place, there is no guarantee that AI will be used in a fair and ethical manner.</p>
   <h2>What Needs to Happen Now</h2>
   <p>Experts agree that Canada must move quickly to establish a regulatory framework for AI. However, the process of creating such a framework is complicated and requires a collaborative approach.</p>
   <p>One possible solution is to establish a national AI council made up of representatives from government, academia, industry, and civil society. The council could work together to develop guidelines and best practices for the use of AI in Canada.</p>
   <p>In addition, the government should invest in AI research and development, both to foster innovation and to ensure that Canada has the necessary expertise to oversee the technology. This investment could also help attract and retain AI talent in Canada.</p>
   <p>Finally, there needs to be greater public education and awareness around the risks and benefits of AI. This will require collaboration between government, industry, and civil society to ensure that Canadians are informed and engaged in the process of AI regulation.</p>
