   <p>Westpac, one of the leading Australian banks, has been exploring the applications of Generative AI. Recently, the bank revealed that it is experimenting with various Generative AI techniques to stimulate technological innovation within the organization.</p>
   <p>Traditionally, Westpac was relying on Open AI's ChatGPT for its AI experiments, but now it is looking to expand its horizons to other Generative AI frameworks as well. In this article, we will explore Westpac's ongoing experiments with Generative AI and its possible implications for the banking industry.</p>
   <h2>The Story Behind Westpacâs Generative AI Experiments</h2>
   <p>It all started when Westpac realized that it needed to accelerate its machine learning initiatives. Being a banking giant, Westpac always looks for ways to leverage customer data to offer personalized services, enhance risk management, and empower its employees. However, the company realized that it was falling behind in the AI race.</p>
   <p>When Westpac analyzed its AI landscape, it found out that it was heavily relying on ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) system developed by Open AI. While ChatGPT was working correctly, the bank was missing out on the vast potential of other Generative AI frameworks.</p>
   <p>With that realization, Westpac decided to experiment with other Generative AI systems, including GPT-3, DeepDreams, and Variational Autoencoder (VAE). The experiments are still ongoing, but the early results have been promising.</p>
