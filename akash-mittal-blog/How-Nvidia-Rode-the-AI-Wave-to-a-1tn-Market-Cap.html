    <h2>The Rise of Nvidia</h2>
    <p>In 1993, a group of young engineers and computer scientists founded a company in California with the goal of creating cutting-edge graphics chips. No one could have predicted that this company, Nvidia, would become one of the most valuable and influential tech companies in the world.</p>
    <p>Nvidia's journey has been marked by a series of strategic pivots, from graphics and gaming to high-performance computing and finally, to artificial intelligence. By embracing the AI wave early on, Nvidia has managed to ride it to a 1tn market cap.</p>

    <p>I've been following Nvidia's journey for years, and what always impresses me is their willingness to take risks and pivot when necessary. When I first heard that they were moving into AI, I was skeptical. But it's clear now that they made the right decision, and their success is proof of that.</p>
    <p>I also had the opportunity to speak with a data scientist who works for an AI startup that uses Nvidia's chips. He told me that Nvidia's technology has been essential to their success, allowing them to process huge amounts of data quickly and accurately.</p>
