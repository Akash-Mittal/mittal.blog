    <h2>The Story of AI Tools in the Workplace</h2>
    <p>Imagine you're a hiring manager trying to sift through hundreds of resumes for a new job opening. It's an overwhelming task, but with the help of an AI tool like ChatGPT, the process becomes much easier. ChatGPT can quickly scan resumes and pull out relevant information, such as a candidate's education, work experience, and skills. It can even rank candidates based on how well they match the job requirements.</p>
    <p>AI tools like ChatGPT are becoming increasingly popular in the workplace. They can automate repetitive tasks, improve decision-making, and reduce errors. But as these tools become more prevalent, it's important for employees to understand their capabilities and limitations.</p>
   </section>
   <section id="examples">
    
    <p>One example of an AI tool that is transforming the workplace is IBM's Watson. Watson is a cognitive computing platform that can analyze large amounts of data and provide insights that can help organizations make better decisions. For example, Watson has helped doctors diagnose medical conditions, retailers predict sales trends, and banks detect fraudulent activity.</p>
    <p>Another example is Google's AutoML. AutoML is a machine learning tool that can create custom AI models with minimal input from human programmers. The tool has been used to improve the accuracy of image and speech recognition systems, among other applications.</p>
    <p>These examples demonstrate how AI tools can improve efficiency and productivity in the workplace. They can save time, reduce costs, and even improve customer satisfaction. However, it's important to remember that these tools are not perfect. They can still make mistakes and require human oversight.</p>
