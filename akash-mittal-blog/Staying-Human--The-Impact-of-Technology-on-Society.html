   <p>Imagine a world where everything is automated. Where robots have taken over most of the jobs that humans used to do. Where artificial intelligence controls our daily lives. Sounds like something straight out of a science fiction movie, right? Well, that reality is not too far away.</p>
   <p>While technology has brought us countless benefits and improved our lives in many ways, it has also raised some serious concerns about the future of humanity. As we become more dependent on machines and algorithms, we risk losing our sense of humanity and the values that make us who we are.</p>
   <p>Take the case of Uber, for example. The ride-hailing giant has revolutionized the transportation industry, making it easier and more convenient for people to get around. But at what cost? By relying on a system of algorithms, Uber has created a culture of exploitation and put the lives of its drivers and passengers at risk.</p>

    <li><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50558949">BBC - Uber to introduce audio recording</a></li>
   </ul>
   <p>Another example is Amazon, the e-commerce giant that has disrupted the retail industry with its fast and efficient delivery system. But at what cost? By relying on a vast network of warehouses and delivery drivers, Amazon has created a system that is taking a toll on the environment and the workers who make it possible.</p>
   <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/17/18681845/amazon-warehouse-employee-injury-rates-robot-delivery-drone">The Verge - Amazon warehouse injury rates are so much higher than the industry standard</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47715174">BBC - Amazon's carbon footprint: 'We have a lot of work to do'</a></li>
   </ul>
   <p>These examples highlight the urgent need for us to re-evaluate the role of technology in our lives and the values that guide our decisions. As we embrace automation and AI, we must also stay true to our humanity and the principles of ethics, compassion, and social responsibility.</p>
   <p>To do so, we need to hold technology companies accountable for their actions and demand transparency in their operations. We also need to educate ourselves and our communities about the risks and benefits of technology and empower individuals to make informed choices.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, while technology may be changing the world at an unprecedented rate, we must never lose sight of our humanity and the values that make us human. By staying true to ourselves and our principles, we can ensure a future where technology serves us, rather than the other way around.</p>
