   <p>As the tension between Beijing and the rest of the world continue to rise, it is important to understand the reasons behind the belligerence that many countries are showing towards China. One interesting story to look at is the recent ban imposed by the Indian government on 59 Chinese apps including TikTok, WeChat and Helo. The ban came after clashes between the Indian and Chinese soldiers in the Galwan Valley which killed 20 Indian soldiers. Many Indians saw the ban as a way of hitting back at China and showing their disapproval of their aggressive behavior towards India.</p>
   <p>But India is not the only country that has been taking a tougher stance towards China. The United States has also been ramping up its rhetoric against Beijing by criticizing their handling of the Coronavirus pandemic, accusing them of human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, and imposing sanctions on Chinese officials. Similarly, Australia has been calling for an independent inquiry into the origins of the virus which has led to a diplomatic spat between the two countries. These examples show that China's behavior is not just worrying its neighbors but also countries that have had close economic ties with them.</p>
   
   <p>The trade war between the US and China has led to both countries imposing tariffs on each other's goods. In 2018, the US imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods and China retaliated with tariffs on $110 billion worth of US goods. This has had a significant impact on both countries' economies with the IMF estimating that the trade tensions could reduce global GDP by 0.8% in 2020.</p>
   <p>China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has also been a cause of concern for some countries. The initiative, which aims to invest in infrastructure projects in over 70 countries across Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, has led to accusations of debt-trap diplomacy and concerns over China's growing influence in these countries. For example, Sri Lanka, which took a loan from China to build a port, was unable to repay the loan and had to give the port to China for 99 years.</p>
   <h2>The Magnetic Title</h2>
   <p>The title of this article, "A Belligerence towards Beijing that is Unsettling" is meant to capture the feeling that many countries are feeling towards China's behavior. The word "Belligerence" implies aggression, hostility, and war-like behavior which is what many countries are accusing China of displaying.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion in 3 points</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>China's aggressive behavior towards its neighbors and the rest of the world is causing concern.</li>
    <li>Many countries are taking a tougher stance towards China by imposing sanctions, banning Chinese apps, and criticizing their behavior.</li>
    <li>The tension between China and the rest of the world is likely to continue unless China changes its behavior.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
   <p>A personal anecdote that illustrates the tensions between China and India is the story of my neighbor who is from India. He told me how disgusted he was with China's behavior towards India and how he supported the ban on Chinese apps. He also mentioned how difficult it was for him to boycott Chinese products since they were so ubiquitous.</p>
   <p>A case study that demonstrates the impact of China's BRI is the story of Sri Lanka. The country's inability to repay its loan to China has resulted in China taking control of a strategic port and has raised concerns about China's growing influence in the region.</p>
