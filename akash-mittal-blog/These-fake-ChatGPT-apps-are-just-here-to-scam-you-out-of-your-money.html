  <h1>How some fake ChatGPT apps are stealing your money in your name</h1> <img src="images/These-fake-ChatGPT-apps-are-just-here-to-scam-you-out-of-your-money.jpeg" alt="+These-fake-ChatGPT-apps-are-just-here-to-scam-you-out-of-your-money+">
  <p>Imagine waking up one day to find out that your bank account has been emptied. You check your transaction history and see that money has been transferred to a strange account overnight. You are puzzled and worried. You don't know what happened. You didn't authorize any such transaction. You didn't even use your phone or computer. You feel violated.</p>
  <p>Well, this is what some people have gone through after downloading a fake ChatGPT app. Yes, ChatGPT is a popular social media platform that allows people to connect with others, share their stories, and get advice. However, some scammers are taking advantage of its popularity and creating fake apps to lure users into giving away their money.</p>
  <p>How do these fake ChatGPT apps work? They use different techniques to trick users into thinking that they are legit. Some apps pretend to offer new features that ChatGPT doesn't have yet, such as video calls or free coins. Others use ChatGPT's logo, name, and branding to make them look authentic. Some even claim that they are owned by ChatGPT itself, which is not true.</p>
  <p>Once users download these fake apps, they ask them to sign up or log in with their ChatGPT account. Then, they ask them to provide their credit card information, PayPal account, or bank details to verify their identity or purchase coins. Users may also be asked to complete a survey or install another app to get the promised benefits. However, the app may steal their sensitive information or infect their device with malware.</p>
  <p>The worst part is that scammers can use the stolen information to access users' bank accounts, make fraudulent purchases, or steal their identity. They can also blackmail users by threatening to expose their personal information or photos if they don't pay them ransom. Users may not realize what happened until it's too late.</p>
  <p>If this scares you, here are some quantifiable examples that you should be aware of:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>According to the FBI, the total amount of reported losses due to "business email compromise" scams, which include fake ChatGPT apps, was $1.77 billion in 2019, up from $1.3 billion in 2018.</li>
   <li>According to Google, the number of removed malicious apps from the Google Play Store in 2020 was 1.9 million, up from 1.6 million in 2019.</li>
   <li>According to McAfee, the number of reported phishing attacks related to ChatGPT increased by 62% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These numbers show that the threat of fake ChatGPT apps is real and growing. Therefore, you should be cautious and avoid downloading apps from unknown sources. Always check for the app's reviews, ratings, and developer's name before downloading. Make sure the app's permissions are necessary and reasonable. Don't provide any sensitive information unless you trust the app's legitimacy. Enable two-factor authentication on your ChatGPT account to add an extra layer of security.</p>
  <p>Moreover, you should be aware of the signs that an app may be fake. These include:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The app asks for permissions that are not necessary for its functionality.</li>
   <li>The app's name, logo, or description is similar but not identical to the original ChatGPT app.</li>
   <li>The app has typos, grammatical errors, or poor design.</li>
   <li>The app's ratings and reviews are fake or suspicious.</li>
   <li>The app crashes, freezes, or behaves oddly.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>By recognizing these signs, you can protect yourself from falling prey to fake ChatGPT apps. Don't let scammers ruin your experience on ChatGPT or any other social media platform. Be vigilant and stay safe online.</p>
