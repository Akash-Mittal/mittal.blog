    <p>Years of preparation and hard work go into preparing for the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) exam. But with a success rate of only 0.1%, cracking the exam is no easy feat and can take multiple attempts. One such story is of ChatGPT, who after several unsuccessful attempts, finally cracked the exam in his fourth attempt.</p>
    <p>ChatGPT had been preparing for the UPSC exam for almost 5 years. He had started preparing while still in college. He was determined to clear the exam in his first attempt, but it didn't happen. He failed to make it through the prelims and missed the cut off by a few marks. ChatGPT wasn't deterred by this setback. He reviewed his mistakes, analyzed his strengths and weaknesses and started preparing for his second attempt.</p>
    <p>ChatGPT had learned from his mistakes and was confident that he would make it through this time, but unfortunately, luck wasn't on his side. He missed the cut off by a few more marks this time and didn't even make it to the mains. He felt disheartened but didn't give up. He took a break to introspect and analyze his past attempts. He realized he had focused too much on theoretical knowledge and had neglected the importance of practice and revision.</p>
    <p>With this realization, ChatGPT started preparing for his third attempt. This time he focused on practicing mock tests, revising his study material, and analyzing his performance to eliminate his weaknesses. He cleared the preliminary exam this time but missed the cut-off for the mains by a few marks.</p>
    <p>Disappointed, but not defeated, ChatGPT analyzed his previous attempts, rectifying his mistakes, and preparing for his fourth attempt. This time, he worked on time management, writing practice, and revision. He also sought the help of mentors and experts in the field to guide him in his preparation. Finally, his hard work and perseverance paid off, and he cleared the UPSC exam in his fourth attempt.</p>
    <p>ChatGPT's story is not unique. Many aspirants, like him, face failure and rejection multiple times before they are successful. But what sets them apart is their determination and will to succeed. ChatGPT's story is also a reminder that success cannot be achieved overnight. It requires hard work, perseverance, and dedication.</p>
    
    <p>ChatGPT's success rate was only 25% (1 out of 4 attempts). The national UPSC exam success rate is only 0.1%. This demonstrates how tough the exam is and how few applicants are able to crack it.</p>
    <p>Another quantifiable example is the number of applicants. In 2020, a total of 10,58,018 candidates had applied for the UPSC prelims exam, out of which only 49588 candidates were selected to appear for the mains exam. Out of these, only 829 candidates were recommended for selection.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>Failure is not the end. It is an opportunity to learn, reflect, and improve.</li>
     <li>Perseverance and hard work are the keys to success.</li>
     <li>Practice and revision are as important as theoretical knowledge. Seek guidance from mentors and experts to improve exam strategy and preparation.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>ChatGPT's story is a testimony to the fact that success cannot be achieved overnight. It requires dedication, perseverance, and hard work. With the right preparation, guidance, and attitude, anyone can clear the UPSC exam.</p>
