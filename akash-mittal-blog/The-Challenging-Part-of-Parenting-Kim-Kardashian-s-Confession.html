      <p class="my-3">Parenting is one of the most rewarding experiences a person can have, but it is also one of the most challenging. Celebrity mom, Kim Kardashian, recently made headlines when she opened up about the struggles she faces while raising her four kids on social media.</p><!-- Article Body: First Paragraph -->
      <p>Kim admitted that she often cries herself to sleep at night as a result of the pressure and stress that come with parenting. She spoke candidly about how challenging it is to balance her career, her marriage, and her role as a mother. It was a refreshing confession that resonated with thousands of other parents who struggle to keep it all together.</p><!-- Article Body: Second Paragraph -->
      <p>So what are some of the challenges that come with parenting? Let's take a look at some quantifiable examples:</p><!-- Article Content: Bullet Points -->
      <ul>
       <li>According to a study by the American Psychological Association, 60% of parents report feeling exhausted, overwhelmed, and stressed most of the time.</li>
       <li>Another study found that mothers who reported higher levels of stress also reported more behavior problems in their children.</li>
       <li>Parents of children with special needs also face unique challenges, such as managing appointments, navigating complex systems, and advocating for their child's needs.</li>
       <li>Lastly, parents are also worried about their child's mental health. According to a recent survey, 86% of parents reported that they were very or somewhat concerned about their child's emotional and mental well-being.</li>
      </ul><!-- Article Body: Third Paragraph -->
      <p>As you can see, parenting can be a lot to handle. However, it is important to remember that you are not alone. There are plenty of resources and support systems out there that can help you overcome these challenges and find balance in your life.</p><!-- Article Body: Fourth Paragraph -->
      <p>Here are three important points to keep in mind:</p><!-- Article Content: Numbered Points -->
      <ol>
       <li><strong>Self-Care is Essential:</strong> You cannot pour from an empty cup. Take the time to prioritize your own physical and mental health. This can be as simple as a daily walk or as complex as therapy. Whatever it is, make sure you are taking care of yourself first.</li>
       <li><strong>Lean on Your Support System:</strong> Reach out to friends, family, or a professional for help when you need it. It can be hard to ask for assistance, but it is important to remember that everyone needs help sometimes. Additionally, connecting with other parents who share similar challenges can be incredibly helpful.</li>
       <li><strong>Be Kind to Yourself:</strong> Parenting is hard and no one is perfect. Remember that mistakes happen, and you are doing the best you can.</li>
      </ol><!-- Article Body: Fifth Paragraph -->
