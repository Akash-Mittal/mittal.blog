    <p>In 2020, when the world was grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, India's diplomatic efforts in cyberspace were gaining momentum. The Indian Embassy in Tokyo organized a virtual hackathon in collaboration with the University of Tokyo and the Indian tech firm Wipro. The hackathon aimed to find innovative solutions to common challenges faced by India, Japan and the world in the post-COVID era.</p>
    
    <p>India's cyber diplomacy has been successful in achieving concrete objectives. For example, in 2019, India played a key role in the adoption of the "Global Conference on Cyberspace (GCCS) 2017 Framework for Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace" at the United Nations. The framework, which aims to provide a common understanding of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, was adopted by 25 countries and is now being used as a basis for international discussions on cyber norms. India's efforts have also led to the establishment of the "Digital India Internship Scheme", which provides internship opportunities to foreign students in Indian companies specializing in digital technologies.</p>
