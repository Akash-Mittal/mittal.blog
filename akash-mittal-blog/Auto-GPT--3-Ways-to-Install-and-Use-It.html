    <ol>
     <li><a href="https://www.openai.com/blog/openai-api/">OpenAI API</a></li>
     <p>The easiest way to start using Auto-GPT is through OpenAI's API. OpenAI has created a powerful, yet easy-to-use API that allows developers to integrate Auto-GPT into their applications. OpenAI provides detailed documentation and a robust community to help users get started. There are several pricing options available, depending on how much you use the service.</p>
     <li><a href="https://github.com/samirjain861/Auto-GPT">Github Repository</a></li>
     <p>The open-source community has also created a GitHub repository for Auto-GPT. This repository contains all the necessary code and instructions for developers to set up Auto-GPT on their local machines. While this option requires a bit of technical know-how, it is entirely free and provides a lot of flexibility in terms of customization and control.</p>
     <li><a href="https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/text-generator">Deep AI</a></li>
     <p>Deep AI is another online platform that offers Auto-GPT and other AI-powered tools for text analysis, generation, and translation. It provides an easy-to-use web interface, allowing users to input their text and get instant responses. Deep AI is more expensive than OpenAI, but it offers more features and customization options.</p>
