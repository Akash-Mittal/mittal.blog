    <h3>Story</h3>
    <p>It all started when 12 year old Jordan from the Bay Area was introduced to ChatGPT by his older sister. ChatGPT is a platform that allows users to chat with a chatbot powered by artificial intelligence. Jordan, who had an interest in programming and technology, quickly became fascinated with ChatGPT and spent hours chatting with the bot.</p>
    <p>However, Jordan noticed that many of his older family members and friends were hesitant to use ChatGPT, either due to lack of interest or lack of understanding about how to use it. Jordan saw an opportunity to help his peers and began training them on how to use ChatGPT effectively.</p>

    <p>One of the adults that Jordan trained was his own grandfather. His grandfather had always been skeptical of technology and never really understood how to use it. However, after just a few training sessions with Jordan, his grandfather was able to use ChatGPT with ease.</p>
