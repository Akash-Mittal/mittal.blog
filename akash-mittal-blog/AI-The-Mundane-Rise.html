  <p>It's 5:00 PM and you're getting ready to leave work. You're tired and hungry and can't wait to get home. As you're shutting down your computer, you get a notification from your boss. There's a report that needs to be finished by tomorrow morning. You groan and reluctantly turn your computer back on.</p>
  <p>But what if there was a way to automate that report? What if you could simply tell your computer what you need and it would produce the report for you? That's the promise of artificial intelligence (AI) â€“ to take care of the mundane tasks that consume our time and energy.</p><!-- Add quantifiable examples -->

   <li>According to a study by Accenture, AI has the potential to increase productivity by up to 40%.</li>
   <li>IBM's Watson is able to diagnose certain types of cancer with 90% accuracy, compared to 50% accuracy for human doctors.</li>
   <li>Amazon's recommendation engine uses AI to suggest products to customers. This has led to a 29% increase in sales.</li>

She no longer has to spend time inputting data, and can instead focus on designing and creating new pieces.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>A hotel in Japan uses an AI system to check in and check out guests, as well as provide recommendations for local restaurants and attractions. This has allowed their staff to focus on more personalized interactions with guests, leading to higher guest satisfaction ratings.</p>
