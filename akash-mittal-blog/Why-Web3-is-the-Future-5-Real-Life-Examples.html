    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>Web3 has been gaining traction in recent years, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic showed the importance of digital communication and security. But this technology is not only useful in crises.</p>
    <p>Imagine being able to send and receive data, money, and even entire applications without fear of censorship, hacking, or centralized control. That's the power of Web3.</p>
    <p>Take Karissa McKelvey, for example. As a designer and developer, she was frustrated with the limitations of Web2 technology and the risks of centralization. That's why she decided to become a Web3 developer and co-founded a company called Okra to help others do the same.</p>

    <h2>Real Life Examples</h2>
    <ul>
     <li><a href="https://ethereum.org/" target="_blank">Ethereum</a> - This blockchain-based platform allows developers to create decentralized apps (dapps) that can run on the network without intermediaries. Companies like Microsoft, JP Morgan, and IBM are already using Ethereum for various purposes, from supply chain management to identity verification.</li>
     <li><a href="https://ipfs.io/" target="_blank">IPFS</a> - This distributed file system allows users to store and share content without relying on centralized servers or HTTP protocols. IPFS can also be used as a backbone for other Web3 applications, such as decentralized social networks and marketplaces.</li>
     <li><a href="https://filecoin.io/" target="_blank">Filecoin</a> - This decentralized storage network uses blockchain and cryptography to incentivize the storage and retrieval of data by anyone in the world. Users can earn rewards by renting their storage space or contributing to the network's security.</li>
     <li><a href="https://opensea.io/" target="_blank">OpenSea</a> - This NFT marketplace allows creators and collectors to buy, sell, and trade unique digital assets, such as artwork, music, and even tweets. OpenSea uses blockchain technology to ensure the authenticity and ownership of each item.</li>
     <li><a href="https://arweave.org/" target="_blank">Arweave</a> - This permanent data storage network uses blockchain and consensus algorithms to guarantee the longevity and accessibility of data, even after centuries. Arweave can be used for archiving scientific research, preserving historical records, and creating trustless archives.</li>
    </ul>
