    <h3>What is Globe Thrivers?</h3>
    <p>Globe Thrivers is a blockchain-based platform that aims to revolutionize the travel industry by providing travelers with a wide range of services, including booking and planning tools, travel insurance, and payment solutions.</p>
    <h3>What is Unlock Protocol?</h3>
    <p>Unlock Protocol is a decentralized protocol that enables creators to monetize their creations beyond traditional subscription and advertising models. This technology has been adapted to enable travelers to use digital passports.</p>
    <h3>How does the Digital Passport Work?</h3>
    <p>The digital passport works by using blockchain technology to create a secure and tamper-proof record of a traveler's identity. The traveler's identity is verified through a series of biometric markers, such as facial recognition or fingerprints, and recorded on the blockchain.</p>
    <p>Once the traveler's identity is confirmed, the digital passport can be used to gain access to various services, such as transportation, accommodation, and even border control. The digital passport can be accessed through a mobile app on the traveler's smartphone, making it more convenient and easier to carry around.</p>
    <h3>Why is the Digital Passport Important?</h3>
    <p>Traveling with physical passports and other IDs can be inconvenient and risky as these documents can get lost or stolen. Furthermore, the process of verification at various checkpoints can be time-consuming and cumbersome.</p>
    <p>The digital passport provides a faster and more secure way for travelers to verify their identity and access various services. This technology can also help prevent identity theft and fraud, as the digital passport is verified through a secure and tamper-proof blockchain.</p>
    <h3>Quantifiable Examples</h3>
    <p>According to a survey by IATA, the majority of travelers are willing to use digital passports for travel. The survey found that:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>74% of travelers are willing to share biometric data such as fingerprints or facial recognition to speed up travel processes</li>
     <li>57% are willing to replace their passports with a digital passport</li>
     <li>33% are willing to pay for expedited border clearance using biometrics</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>The partnership between Globe Thrivers and Unlock Protocol is a game-changer for the travel industry. The digital passport provides a fast and secure way for travelers to verify their identity, making travel easier and more convenient. Here are the key takeaways from this article:</p>
