  <p></p>
  <p>Once upon a time, people used to gather at a market to pick their favorite products, haggle with the vendors, and make their purchases. That was the only way to shop until the 21st century when e-commerce emerged, giving people the chance to buy goods online without leaving home. However, this shopping experience lacked the human touch that comes with traditional markets. Enter Live Shopping, the emerging trend that is revolutionizing e-commerce.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Live Shopping is a real-time shopping experience where businesses broadcast their products live on social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube. It enables businesses to showcase their products to a larger audience while engaging with their customers in real-time.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Rakuten Intelligence revealed that Live Sales increased by 40% in the first half of 2020, indicating significant growth. But what makes Live Shopping so engaging and effective in boosting sales? The answer is simple - the human interaction in the Live Shopping experience.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>How Live Shopping Works</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The setup is straightforward - brands or businesses host a Live Shopping event on social media, where their followers can tune in to view the products and make a purchase. The broadcasts often involve a host, who will showcase the products in real-time, answer questions from viewers, and explain the features and benefits of each product.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>When viewers tune in, they can interact with the host and other viewers in real-time. This creates a sense of community around the product, as users share their opinions and ask questions, leading to a more engaging and personal shopping experience.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable Examples</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The impact of Live Shopping on e-commerce sales is visible from a few examples by businesses. In June 2021, QVC experienced a 10% lift in sales using Facebook Live, and Alibaba achieved $15.1 billion sales in a single day through its Live Shopping event.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Tips to Maximize the Benefits</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Here are some tips to help businesses make the most of the Live Shopping experience:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Promote in Advance: Promoting the event is essential to attract the maximum audience. Social media platforms like Instagram provide a feature to notify users 24 hours before the Live begins.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Engage with the audience: Engage with the audience and offer discounts or incentives to encourage sales. This is a great way to increase the sense of community and create a loyal customer base.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Use professional equipment: High-quality audio and video equipment are critical for delivering a great user experience. Poor-quality audio or video can turn off viewers.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Live Shopping has lowered the barriers of e-commerce shopping, offering a more personable and interactive experience over traditional online shopping. Businesses have a chance to show their human side while bringing their products to life using Live Shopping. This emerging trend is not just a trend - it is a paradigm shift in the world of e-commerce shopping.</p>
