  <p>Once upon a time, I met a couple who had a newborn baby. They were overjoyed with their little bundle of joy, but they were also worried about providing for their child. They lived in San Francisco, one of the most expensive cities in the US, and they were struggling to make ends meet. The cost of living was so high that they had to sacrifice many luxuries, including eating out at restaurants, going on vacations, and buying new clothes.</p>
  <p></p>
