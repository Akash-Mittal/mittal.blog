  <h1>How Funnel Web Spiders Practice Safe Sex</h1> <img src="images/How-Funnel-Web-Spiders-Practice-Safe-Sex.jpeg" alt="+How-Funnel-Web-Spiders-Practice-Safe-Sex+">
  <p>Did you know that among the arachnid community, funnel web spiders are the most sexually adventurous? In fact, they are known to engage in risky sexual behavior such as multiple partners and cannibalism. Yet, they seem to have mastered the art of safe sex. Read on to find out how!</p>
  
  <p>Studies have shown that male funnel web spiders who engage in sexual cannibalism are more likely to choose larger females who have already mated. This reduces the risk of being eaten before copulation. Additionally, males will often present the female with a gift of silk or prey to distract her from attacking him.</p>
  
  <p>As a spider enthusiast, I once witnessed the mating behavior of funnel web spiders in my backyard. The male carefully approached the female and presented her with a piece of silk. She seemed to be pleased and accepted the gift. They then mated for several minutes before the male quickly retreated.</p>
