  <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
  <p>It is said that technology has taken over the world. Artificial Intelligence research since its inception has brought to us numerous advantages in various fields. With the aid of AI, we can accomplish many tasks easier and faster than we used to. AI has been transformative and has led to significant progress in fields like medicine, transportation, and entertainment. However, AI has the potential for misuse, and its increasing sophistication and prevalence are raising concerns among some of the most influential people in Silicon Valley and beyond.</p>
  <p><strong>Story</strong></p>
  <p>The CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman, testified before the Senate on Artificial Intelligence (AI). During the session, he addressed the potential dangers that AI could pose to humanity; dangers such as job displacement, misinformation, and data breaches. Furthermore, he noted that the most significant danger lies in the potential for AI to surpass humanity's cognitive capabilities.</p>
  <p>Senators, as well as tech leaders, have started to voice their concerns over the topic. They worry about what would happen if we become too reliant on Artificial intelligence as machines could replace humans and the consequences that follow it.</p>
  <p><strong>Quantifiable examples</strong></p>
  <p>AI has made substantial progress in the past decade. For example, AI-powered facial recognition technology is now being used to fight crime. However, the technology can recognize faces incorrectly, leading to wrongful arrests.</p>
  <p>Another example is the use of machine learning algorithms by financial institutions to predict creditworthiness, customer churn, and fraud detection. In 2018, it was reported that a Chinese lender was using facial recognition technology to identify fraudulent applicants. The company claimed to be able to identify fraudulent patterns in loan applications with 98.6% accuracy. However, this technology can also lead to privacy concerns and leave some sections of the population unbanked.</p>
  <p><strong>Personal anecdotes or case studies</strong></p>
  <p>Last year, a Boeing 737 MAX plane crashed, killing all 157 people on board. The plane relied heavily on automated systems to fly and navigate. It later emerged that the plane software, which relied heavily on AI technology, malfunctioned, leading to the tragic accident.</p>
  <p>The incident highlights the potential harm that AI-powered systems can cause in our daily lives. If we become too reliant on AI and automated technologies, we could be setting ourselves up for similar catastrophic events in the future.</p>
  <p><strong>Conclusion in 3 points</strong></p>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>The development of AI has many advantages for society.</strong> AI is transforming fields such as medicine, transportation, and entertainment.</li>
   <li><strong>There are potential dangers in the increasing use of AI.</strong> Job displacement, privacy invasion, and the use of AI in autonomous military systems are among the concerns. In addition, AI has the potential to surpass human cognitive capabilities, leading to an existential threat to humanity.</li>
   <li><strong>We must carefully manage the development and use of AI.</strong> Stricter regulations, increased scrutiny, and ethical considerations must be taken into account when developing and implementing AI-powered technologies.</li>
