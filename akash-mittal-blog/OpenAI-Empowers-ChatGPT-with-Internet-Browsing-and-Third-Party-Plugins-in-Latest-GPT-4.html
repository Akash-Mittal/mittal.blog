    <p>Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Lily who loved to chat with her friends on social media. She would spend hours online, talking about everything from school to fashion to music. But as much as she loved chatting, there was one thing that always frustrated her - the limitations of the chat interface itself.</p>
    <p>She would often find herself wishing that she could do more than just type messages - she wanted to be able to open links, listen to music, and even play games, all within the chat window. But alas, this was not possible.</p>
