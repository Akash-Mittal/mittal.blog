  <h2>How Juniper MIST Works</h2>
  <p>Juniper MIST is an AI-driven security solution that operates in three main stages:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>Pre-Connection:</strong> Before a device or user is allowed to join the network, Juniper MIST authenticates the credentials and checks for compliance with security policies. Non-compliant devices are blocked from the network.</li>
   <li><strong>Post-Connection:</strong> Once a device or user is connected to the network, Juniper MIST continuously monitors network activities to identify potential security threats. If a threat is detected, the infected device is isolated from the network to prevent further damage.</li>
   <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> Juniper MIST provides detailed analytics on network activities, enabling organizations to identify potential security threats and trends. This information can be used to improve security policies and prevent future incidents.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Juniper MIST operates seamlessly with ChatGPT Zoom and NAC security service, providing a comprehensive security solution for organizations. Let's look at some practical tips for implementing Juniper MIST.</p>
