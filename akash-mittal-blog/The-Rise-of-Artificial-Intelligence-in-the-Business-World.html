   <p>Imagine that you are in a shopping mall looking for a perfect outfit for a special occasion. You wander around the stores aimlessly, and then you see a store with a window display that catches your eye. When you enter the store, a friendly AI-powered bot greets you and asks about your preference and size. You tell the bot what you are looking for and the bot recommends some dresses. You try them on in the fitting room and the bot suggests the best one based on your preference, size, and body type. You leave the store with a perfect outfit in the shortest time possible.</p>
   <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
   <p>The scenario described earlier is not a concept of a sci-fi movie but is a reality. AI-powered bots have already been implemented in various industries, revolutionizing business operations, and customer experiences. For instance:</p>

    <li>Amazon uses AI algorithms to predict customer's buying patterns and make personalized recommendations.</li>
