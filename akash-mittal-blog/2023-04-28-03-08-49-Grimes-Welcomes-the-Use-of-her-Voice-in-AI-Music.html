    <h2>Real Life Examples</h2>
    <p>Grimes is not the only artist who has welcomed the use of AI in music. In fact, several music companies are using AI to create new songs, remixes, and even entire albums. One such example is Amper Music, an AI platform that allows users to create custom music using their vast library of samples and loops.</p>
    <p>Another company, Jukedeck, uses AI to create original music based on certain parameters such as genre, mood, and tempo. Their software has been used in various advertisements and even in a short film called "Zone Out".</p>
    <p>These examples showcase how AI is not only changing the music industry but also how it is becoming an integral part of the creative process.</p>
