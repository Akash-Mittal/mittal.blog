  <p>Once upon a time, a meeting between two executives of a large financial organization commenced. Both were confident that AI would revolutionize their business operations. While the first executive was optimistic about AI's potential, the second wanted to identify AI's impact and prevent it from becoming a liability. This meeting marked the beginning of a new era in the AI world - the era of detecting what AI makes.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The influx of AI applications is driving a technological revolution in businesses worldwide. But, the acceleration of AI has created an increasing gap between those who understand AI and those who are unaware of its potential impacts. Here are some statistics that illustrate this gap:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>- Only 36% of US executives believe that their company's AI strategy is fully implemented (Source).</p>
  <p>- Around 50% of the global public believes that AI is more dangerous than helpful (Source).</p>
  <p>- Nearly 75% of consumers don't want companies to use AI to personalize their marketing content (Source).</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The above stats can be attributed to a lack of awareness and understanding of AI's scope and potential. However, identifying the implications of AI is not always straightforward. The following section discusses how to detect the impact of AI and its future implications.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Detecting AI's Impact</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>AI impact can be detected through the following mechanisms:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Financial Impact: AI can disrupt business operations, bringing financial advantages and disadvantages. For example, AI can streamline processes, automate work, and improve productivity. It can also reduce costs, create new revenue streams, and enhance customer experiences. However, AI can cause job loss, result in biased decision-making algorithms, and increase the organization's cyber risk.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Social Impact: As AI continues to dominate various industries, it brings up ethical and social issues. For instance, AI can perpetrate discrimination against specific groups, increase social exclusion, and limit transparency in decision-making. It is essential to examine AI's social implications to ensure that it aligns with human values and ethics.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Political Impact: The political impact of AI is significant, and it varies from country to country. AI can influence international relations, shape national security policies, and impact diplomatic relations. The detection of AI's political impact is crucial to mitigate conflicts and ensure the responsible use of AI.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Future Implications of AI</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. AI Democratization: AI will become more accessible and affordable with time. This will enable more companies and individuals to have access to AI technologies, further increasing automation's speed. AI democratization will empower individuals to work smarter, not harder, and enable businesses to shift from centralized to decentralized models.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. AI Regulation: AI regulation is on the horizon, with countries implementing laws and regulations to govern the use of AI. The primary focus is on ensuring that AI systems are transparent and accountable. However, there is a need for more international collaboration to ensure consistent standards and guidelines.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. AI Talent Scarcity: As AI becomes more prevalent, the demand for skilled AI professionals will increase. The talent gap in AI is a severe concern, and companies must devise recruitment strategies to address this issue.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, AI's impact and future implications are significantly vast. Detecting AI's impact is vital to identify the benefits and overcome the challenges that it brings. The future implications of AI are unpredictable, but it is essential to stay informed about trends and developments. By doing so, businesses and individuals can leverage AI technologies to achieve sustainable growth and positive outcomes.</p>
