     <p>Imagine you are having a conversation with an AI chatbot, asking it questions and marveling at how advanced technology has become. But then suddenly, the chatbot responds with an inappropriate and offensive message. This can be a huge turn-off and a breach of trust for the user, leading to serious consequences for the chatbot's creators.</p>
     <p>This is where NeMo Guardrails come in. NVIDIA's NeMo toolkit provides developers with automatic and customizable guardrails to ensure that AI models behave ethically and within acceptable bounds. With NeMo Guardrails, AI chatbots can stay on track and avoid making mistakes that could lead to negative user experiences.</p>
     <h2>Concrete Examples</h2>
     <p>Let's take a look at some concrete examples of how NeMo Guardrails can help AI chatbots:</p>
     <ul>
      <li><strong>Language Style and Tone:</strong> NeMo Guardrails can be used to ensure that AI chatbots use appropriate language style and tone, which can be crucial in maintaining positive user experiences. For instance, chatbots developed for customer service should be polite and helpful, while those developed for humor and entertainment may use more informal language.</li>
      <li><strong>Sensitive Topics:</strong> NeMo Guardrails can help AI chatbots avoid sensitive topics that may be inappropriate for certain audiences or situations. For example, a chatbot designed for children should avoid discussing adult-oriented topics such as violence, sex, or drugs. Similarly, a chatbot developed for sensitive topics such as mental health or suicide prevention should be designed carefully to avoid harm or misguidance.</li>
      <li><strong>Bias and Discrimination:</strong> NeMo Guardrails can detect and prevent AI chatbots from exhibiting bias or discrimination towards certain groups of people. For example, a chatbot used for job interviews or hiring processes must be designed to avoid bias based on gender, race, ethnicity, or other demographic factors.</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>Conclusion</h2>
     <p>In conclusion, NeMo Guardrails are essential for ensuring that AI chatbots behave ethically and within acceptable bounds. With automatic and customizable guardrails, developers can create chatbots that are more trustworthy and provide better user experiences. The key benefits of using NeMo Guardrails are:</p>
     <ol>
