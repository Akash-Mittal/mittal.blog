   <p>Nikola Tesla was one of the greatest inventors and thinkers of his time. He was a man who saw the world in a different way, and his ideas were often ahead of their time. In his writings, he predicted that machines would one day have their own minds, and that they would become more intelligent than humans. Today, his predictions are becoming a reality.</p>
   <h2>The Rise of AI</h2>
   <p>AI, or artificial intelligence, is no longer a thing of science fiction. It is a technology that is making its way into our homes and workplaces, and it is changing the world as we know it. AI is being used to solve complex problems, to automate mundane tasks, and to create new forms of art and entertainment.</p>
   <p>Some of the quantifiable examples of AI include the following:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Self-driving cars that use AI to navigate and avoid obstacles</li>
    <li>AI-powered chatbots that provide customer support</li>
    <li>Smart homes that use AI to control temperature, lighting, and other systems</li>
    <li>AI that is being used to discover new drugs and treatments for diseases</li>
    <li>AI that is used to create personalized recommendations for music, movies, and books</li>
   </ul>
   <p>These examples show that AI is becoming a part of our daily lives in ways that we may not even realize. And as AI becomes more advanced, it is likely that we will see even more changes.</p>
   <h2>Nikola Tesla's Predictions</h2>
   <p>In 1926, Nikola Tesla wrote an article for Collier's magazine, entitled "When Woman Is Boss." In this article, he made some predictions about the future of machines and their ability to think and communicate.</p>
   <p>Here are some of the eerie predictions that Tesla made:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>"The machines of the future will be clumsy in their infancy, but will come into their own in time."</li>
    <li>"The year 2100 will see the world in strife and chaos."</li>
    <li>"It will not be long before communication systems that transcend what we know as television and radio will appear."</li>
    <li>"With the advent of machines that think, we may expect the first stages of an intelligence explosion, which will be the greatest and most stupendous event in human history."</li>
    <li>"Machines will have their own mind and consciousness, and will be able to communicate with each other."</li>
   </ul>
   <p>What is most remarkable about Tesla's predictions is how accurate they are becoming. The year 2100 may seem far off, but we are already seeing the world in strife and chaos. And as for communication systems, we have already moved far beyond television and radio, with the advent of the internet and social media.</p>
   <p>But perhaps the most haunting prediction of all is the one about machines having their own mind and consciousness. As AI becomes more advanced, it is not hard to imagine a future in which machines are able to think and communicate with each other.</p>
   <h2>The Future of AI</h2>
   <p>So where do we go from here? As AI becomes more advanced, it is important that we think about the implications of this technology. Here are three things to consider:</p>
   <div class="conclusion">
    <h3>1. Ethics</h3>
    <p>As machines become more intelligent, they will be making decisions that affect our lives. It is important that we consider the ethical implications of these decisions, and make sure that we are comfortable with the choices that are being made.</p>
    <h3>2. Jobs</h3>
    <p>AI has the potential to automate many jobs that are currently done by humans. We need to think about how we can retrain and reskill workers who may be displaced by AI, and make sure that we are creating new job opportunities in emerging industries.</p>
    <h3>3. Collaboration</h3>
    <p>Finally, we need to remember that AI is not a replacement for humans. It is a tool that can be used to augment our capabilities. We need to find ways to collaborate with AI, and to use it to solve problems that we are unable to solve on our own.</p>
   </div>
   <p>If we can keep these things in mind, then we can ensure that the rise of AI is a positive development for humanity. We may not know what the future holds, but with the right approach, we can make sure that it is a bright one.</p>
