   <p>My interest in computer science started when I was just a child. My father worked in IT and brought home a computer for us to use. I loved figuring out how it worked and exploring all the things we could do with it.</p>
   <p>As I grew up, I realized that computer science was not only a hobby but a valuable skill that could shape my future. So, I decided to take computer science as a Leaving Cert subject.</p>
   <h2> the Impact of Computer Science</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Computer science careers have grown by 45% since 2019 (source: <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm" target="_blank">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>)</li>
    <li>Robots have boosted productivity by 22% (source: <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/economy/global-manufacturing-survey.html" target="_blank">PwC's 2016 Global Industry 4.0 Survey</a>)</li>
    <li>Mobile apps have had a revenue growth of 23% from 2019 to 2020 (source: <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/app-revenues/" target="_blank">Business of Apps</a>)</li>
   </ul>
   <p>These are just a few examples of how computer science has revolutionized the world. From making businesses more efficient to improving healthcare and communication, the possibilities are endless.</p>
   <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
   <p>When I graduated from college, I landed a job at a tech company as a software engineer. I was thrilled to be working in such an innovative environment and putting my skills to use.</p>
   <p>One of my projects involved creating an app that helped doctors monitor patients in real-time. It was amazing to see how something I had created could have such a positive impact on healthcare. The app increased patient safety and improved communication between doctors and their teams.</p>
   <p>Another anecdote comes from a friend of mine who used computer science to pivot her career. She had been working as a nurse for many years but became interested in medical research. By learning how to code and analyze data, she was able to transition into a research role and become a valuable asset to her team.</p>
   <h2>Practical Tips for Success in Computer Science</h2>
   <p>Here are a few tips for anyone interested in pursuing a career in computer science:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Start learning to code as early as possible</li>
