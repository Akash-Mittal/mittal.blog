    <p>Like many startup companies in the cryptocurrency market, Coinbase has faced its fair share of challenges. However, thanks to its willingness to adapt, the exchange has managed to weather the storm and emerge stronger than ever.</p>
    <p>One of the most significant achievements for Coinbase in recent years has been its ability to cut costs while expanding its revenue streams. By streamlining its operations and focusing on its core competencies, the company has managed to reduce its losses and generate more revenue than ever before.</p>
    <p>How did Coinbase achieve this? Let's take a closer look.</p>

   <section id="examples">
    <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
    <p>One example of Coinbase's cost-cutting strategy is its decision to move its customer support operations from its San Francisco headquarters to a cheaper location in New Mexico. By doing so, the company was able to save money on rent and other expenses while still providing high-quality customer service to its users.</p>
    <p>Another way Coinbase has expanded its revenue streams is by offering more cryptocurrency trading pairs on its exchange. In the past, the company only supported a few major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, by adding dozens of new digital assets to its platform, Coinbase has been able to attract more traders and generate more trading fees.</p>
    <p>Finally, Coinbase has also launched new products like Coinbase Pro and Coinbase Commerce that offer additional services to its users. With Coinbase Pro, traders can access advanced trading tools and features, while Coinbase Commerce enables merchants to accept cryptocurrency payments from customers.</p>
