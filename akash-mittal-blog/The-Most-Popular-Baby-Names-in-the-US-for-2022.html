   <p>As we can see, the top baby names of 2022 in the US are dominated by short and sweet names with timeless appeal. Strong biblical names are still popular, but there is also a surge in modern and exotic names that reflect diversity and creativity. Interestingly, gender-neutral names are also gaining momentum, as parents seek to break free from traditional expectations and let their child's personality shine beyond their sex.</p>
   <h2>The Impact of Pop Culture and Social Media</h2>
   <p>While classic names will always remain a favorite, we cannot ignore the influence of pop culture and social media on baby naming trends. For instance, the name Khai, which means "crowned" in Arabic, has jumped 476 spots on the US charts due to the popularity of model Gigi Hadid and singer Zayn Malik's daughter. Social media platforms like TikTok have also contributed to the rise of unique and innovative names, such as Charli, Evolet, and Kulture.</p>
   <h2>The Importance of Personal Choice and Meaning</h2>
   <p>Despite the external factors that may influence baby name choices, it's essential to remember that the ultimate decision should come from the heart of the parents. After all, they are the ones who will call out their child's name hundreds of times a day, sing lullabies with it, and watch it evolve throughout life. Therefore, it's important to choose a name that resonates with you and your partner's values, culture, and dreams, and that carries a meaningful story.</p>
