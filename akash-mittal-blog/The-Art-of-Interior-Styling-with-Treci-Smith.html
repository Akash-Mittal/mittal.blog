  <p>It was a beautiful day in San Diego when I met Treci Smith, an interior stylist who has helped transform countless homes into beautiful masterpieces. During our conversation, Treci shared with me the key principles that she follows when creating a stylish and functional living space.</p>
  <h2>1. Use Colors that Complement Each Other</h2>
  <p>One of the first things Treci does when styling a room is to select a color palette that complements each other. She explains that colors can set the tone for a space, and it's important to choose carefully. For example, if you're going for a calming and serene feel, cool colors like blues and grays are a great choice. On the other hand, if you want a space to feel more energetic and lively, warm colors like yellows and reds can be ideal.</p>
  <p>Treci also explains that it's important to consider the lighting in a room when choosing colors. Natural light can make colors look different than artificial light, so it's important to test different colors in the lighting that the room will be used in.</p>
  <h2>2. Add Personal Touches</h2>
  <p>Treci emphasizes that adding personal touches to a space is essential to making it feel like a home. She suggests incorporating family photos, souvenirs from trips, or other meaningful items into your décor. Not only does this help personalize your space, but it can also be a great conversation starter when guests visit.</p>
  <p>When adding these personal touches, Treci advises keeping balance in mind. For example, if you have a lot of family photos, consider choosing a mix of large and small frames and displaying them on different walls and surfaces throughout your space.</p>
  <h2>3. Focus on Functionality</h2>
  <p>While creating a beautiful space is important, Treci also emphasizes the need for functionality. She suggests considering the flow of the room and how the furniture will be used. For example, if you have a small living room, consider choosing furniture that can serve multiple purposes, such as a daybed with a trundle or a coffee table with storage.</p>
  <p>Treci also advises considering the needs of everyone who will be using the space. If you have young children, for example, you may want to choose furniture with durable and easy-to-clean fabrics. If you have pets, you may want to consider using stain-resistant upholstery.</p>
  <p>Overall, Treci's approach to interior styling is focused on creating beautiful, functional spaces that feel personal and inviting. By following these key principles, you can transform any room in your home into a beautiful masterpiece.</p>
