  <h1>In Kashmir, Tourists Return but Tensions Simmer</h1> <img src="images/In-Kashmir-Tourists-Return-but-Tensions-Simmer-The-Wall-Street-Journal.jpeg" alt="+In-Kashmir-Tourists-Return-but-Tensions-Simmer-The-Wall-Street-Journal+">
  <p>Tourists have started to return to the picturesque valley of Kashmir, but tensions between India and Pakistan continue to simmer in the region.</p>
  <p>In recent years, the disputed Himalayan territory has seen a surge in violence, with militants targeting Indian security forces and civilians in the predominantly Muslim area.</p>
  <p>While the Indian government has tightened security measures to counter the insurgency, the situation remains volatile, with regular clashes between protesters and the authorities.</p>
  
  <p>During a recent trip to the region, we met a group of tourists who had come to Kashmir to experience its natural beauty and culture.</p>
  <p>One of them, a woman from Germany, told us that she was initially hesitant to visit the region due to the security concerns, but was eventually convinced by the positive feedback from other foreigners who had visited the area.</p>
  <p>Despite some minor incidents, the group felt safe and enjoyed their stay in Kashmir, saying that they were impressed by the hospitality of the locals and the stunning landscapes.</p>
  
  <ul>
   <li>Tourism is a major industry in Kashmir, accounting for over 10% of the region's GDP.</li>
   <li>Since the easing of travel restrictions in 2011, there has been a steady increase in the number of tourists visiting the valley.</li>
   <li>According to official figures, over 600,000 tourists visited the region in 2019, up from around 400,000 in 2011.</li>
   <li>However, the ongoing tensions and occasional violence in the region have led to a decline in tourist arrivals in recent years.</li>
