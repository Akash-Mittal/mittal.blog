   <p>Artificial intelligence is transforming the way we live and work, but it's also threatening some of the most common jobs – many of which are held by women. According to a recent study, up to 25% of all jobs are at risk of being automated by AI, and many of these jobs are in sectors that are predominantly female.</p>
   <h2>The Problem</h2>
   <p>As the study shows, industries such as retail, hospitality, and healthcare are among the most at risk of job losses due to AI. These industries have historically employed a high number of women, who are now facing the prospect of unemployment or underemployment as artificial intelligence technology continues to advance.</p>
   <p>For example, AI-powered chatbots and voice assistants are already being used to replace human customer service representatives and receptionists. As these technologies improve, they may soon be able to perform more complex tasks that were previously the domain of human workers, such as diagnosing medical conditions or even performing surgery.</p>
   <h2>The Quantifiable Examples</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>According to a report by the World Economic Forum, 58% of the jobs at highest risk of being automated are currently held by women.</li>
    <li>In the UK, women hold 70% of the jobs that are most at risk of automation, while men hold 73% of the jobs that are least at risk.</li>
    <li>Research by the McKinsey Global Institute estimates that 20% of administrative and support roles, which are often held by women, could be automated by 2030.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>The Solution</h2>
   <p>While the future of work in an AI-driven world may seem bleak for women, there are steps that can be taken to mitigate the impact. Here are three ways we can help women prepare for the jobs of the future:</p>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>Invest in retraining and upskilling programs:</strong> Governments and businesses should work together to provide training and education programs that help women transition into new, AI-driven roles.</li>
    <li><strong>Encourage girls to pursue STEM fields:</strong> Women are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and math fields. By encouraging girls to study STEM subjects and pursue careers in these fields, we can help ensure that women are represented in the jobs of the future.</li>
    <li><strong>Create more opportunities for women in AI:</strong> Women are also underrepresented in the field of artificial intelligence. By creating more opportunities for women to work in AI research, development, and implementation, we can help ensure that AI technologies are designed with a diverse set of perspectives and use cases in mind.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>Artificial intelligence technology is already changing the way we work, but it's also highlighting some of the systemic issues facing women in the workplace. By taking steps to ensure that women are included in the development and implementation of AI technologies, we can help ensure a more equitable future of work.</p>
