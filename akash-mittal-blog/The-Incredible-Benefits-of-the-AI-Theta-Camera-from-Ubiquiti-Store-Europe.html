  <h2> about AI Theta Camera</h2>
  <p>During my testing of the AI Theta Camera, I was particularly impressed with its ability to recognize and track individuals in real-time. I set the camera up in a busy shopping area, and within minutes, it had identified and started to track three separate individuals. The camera's AI algorithms were able to identify each person based on their unique features, such as their clothing or facial features, and then track them as they moved throughout the area.</p>
  <p>Another impressive feature of the AI Theta Camera is its two-way audio feature. During my tests, I was able to use the feature to communicate with people directly from the camera. This allowed me to speak to people before letting them into a secured area and provided an extra layer of security.</p>
