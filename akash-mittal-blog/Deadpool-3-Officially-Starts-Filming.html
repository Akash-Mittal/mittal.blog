    <p>It's been three long years since the release of <em>Deadpool 2</em>, and fans have been eagerly anticipating news of a third installment in the irreverent superhero franchise. Finally, on August 3, 2021, star Ryan Reynolds announced on social media that <strong>Deadpool 3 had officially started filming</strong>. The announcement was accompanied by a photo of Deadpool in front of a chalkboard, with the words "Deadpool 3" written on it in colorful chalk.</p>

    <p>While details about the film are still under wraps, fans can expect more of the over-the-top humor and action that has made the first two movies box office hits. The sequel is also expected to be the first <strong>Deadpool film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe</strong>, as Disney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox has allowed for the character's integration into the larger Marvel universe.</p>
    <p>So what can fans expect from <em>Deadpool 3</em>? Here are three possibilities:</p>
    <ul>
     <li><strong>More Meta References</strong>: One of the hallmarks of the <em>Deadpool</em> franchise is its self-awareness, with the titular character frequently breaking the fourth wall and referencing other movies and pop culture. With the character now firmly established in the Marvel universe, there are even more possibilities for meta jokes and references, especially with the introduction of new characters and storylines.</li>
     <li><strong>Bigger and Better Action</strong>: The <em>Deadpool</em> movies are known for their over-the-top action sequences, and fans can expect more of the same in the third installment. With the budget likely being even higher this time around, the filmmakers will have even more room to create epic set pieces and stunts for the Merc with a Mouth.</li>
     <li><strong>New Characters</strong>: With the film now part of the Marvel universe, there are a plethora of new characters that the <em>Deadpool</em> franchise can introduce. Whether it's other mutants, heroes, or villains, there are endless possibilities for new characters to populate the world of <em>Deadpool 3</em>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Whatever the filmmakers decide to do with <em>Deadpool 3</em>, one thing is for sure: fans are excited to see Ryan Reynolds don the red spandex once again and bring his unique brand of comedy and action to the screen.</p>
