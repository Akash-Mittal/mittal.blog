  <h1>New York Lawyer Caught Using ChatGPT After Citing Cases That Don't Exist</h1> <img src="images/New-York-Lawyer-Caught-Using-ChatGPT-After-Citing-Cases-That-Don-t-Exist.jpeg" alt="+New-York-Lawyer-Caught-Using-ChatGPT-After-Citing-Cases-That-Don-t-Exist+">
  <p>Being a lawyer is not an easy profession, and it involves a lot of hard work and dedication. Lawyers deal with complex legal issues and have to be well-versed with the law to win their cases in court. However, some lawyers are not as diligent as they should be and try to take shortcuts to win cases.</p>
  <p>A recent incident in New York has highlighted this issue, where a lawyer was caught using ChatGPT to cite cases that don't exist during a trial. ChatGPT is an AI-based software that generates plausible text based on a given input. The lawyer used ChatGPT to generate fake cases and quoted them during a trial to strengthen his argument.</p>
  <p>The lawyer's unethical behavior was exposed when the opposing counsel tried to look up the cases that the lawyer had cited, but they couldn't find them. The opposing counsel then confronted the lawyer, and he confessed to using ChatGPT to create fake cases.</p>
  <p>This incident shows that you cannot take shortcuts in the legal profession, and lawyers have to do their due diligence to avoid ethical violations.</p>
