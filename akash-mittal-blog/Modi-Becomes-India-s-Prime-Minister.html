    <p>It was the year 2014. India was gearing up for its general election and the world was watching closely. Narendra Modi, the Chief Minister of the state of Gujarat, was running for the post of Prime Minister as the candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The campaign was intense, with Modi travelling across the country to connect with voters.</p>
    <p>One incident that stands out from the campaign trail was a speech given by Modi in the city of Kanpur. As he was speaking, a strong gust of wind blew away his turban. Without missing a beat, Modi caught the turban mid-air and continued with his speech, earning him the admiration of his supporters.</p>
