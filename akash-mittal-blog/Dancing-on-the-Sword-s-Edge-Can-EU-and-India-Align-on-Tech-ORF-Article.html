    <h2 class="subtitle">The Story of Two Tech Worlds</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time, India was known for its expertise in information technology, particularly in software development and services. On the other side of the world, the European Union was renowned for its advanced technological advancements, particularly in manufacturing, aerospace, and automobile sectors. However, with the rise of tech giants from Silicon Valley and China, the tech landscape has changed dramatically in recent years.</p>
    <p>Today, both India and the EU are struggling to keep up with the rapid pace of innovation. While India is still struggling to establish its presence in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain, the EU faces the challenge of catching up with the US and China in terms of 5G deployment and other futuristic technologies.</p>
    <p>So the question arises - can the EU and India find common ground and collaborate on technology to bridge the gap?</p>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Quantifiable Examples</h2>
    <p>Let's look at some numbers to understand the current state of the tech environment in both India and the EU:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>The Indian IT industry is worth $191 billion, but only a small portion of it comes from developing cutting-edge software.</li>
     <li>The EU's digital market was valued at €583 billion in 2019, and it is expected to grow to €720 billion by 2022, but it is still far behind the US and China.</li>
     <li>India is home to the world's second-largest internet user base, with over 600 million internet users, but only 22% of the population uses smartphones.</li>
     <li>The EU has the highest number of patent applications in the world, but it trails behind the US and China in terms of artificial intelligence research and development.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Can EU and India Align on Tech?</h2>
    <p>The answer to this question is not a simple yes or no. There are several factors that need to be taken into consideration when it comes to aligning the interests of the EU and India on technology:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Policy Alignment: Both the EU and India need to have a common policy framework that fosters innovation and digital transformation. This includes initiatives such as smart city projects, open data policies, and regulations that protect intellectual property rights.</li>
     <li>Research and Development: Both regions need to invest in research and development in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and quantum computing. This will require collaboration between academia, industry, and government.</li>
     <li>Talent Pool: Both regions need to develop a pool of skilled workers who are equipped to deal with the changing technological landscape. This requires investment in education and training programs.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="subtitle"> and Case Studies</h2>
    <p>Let's take a look at some real-world examples of how the EU and India are working together to bridge the gap in technology:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Wipro, an Indian IT services company, has partnered with the Austrian software company, Sasha, to develop an AI-powered procurement platform for the automotive industry.</li>
     <li>The EU and India are collaborating on the Next Generation Internet initiative, which aims to develop secure and trustworthy internet services using emerging technologies.</li>
     <li>The Indian government has launched the Digital India initiative, which aims to transform the country into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy. The EU has also launched similar initiatives such as the Digital Single Market initiative.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, the EU and India have a lot to gain from aligning their interests and collaborating on technology. However, this will require a lot of effort and investment from both sides. By focusing on policy alignment, research and development, and talent pool development, the EU and India can work towards a more inclusive and sustainable digital future.</p>
