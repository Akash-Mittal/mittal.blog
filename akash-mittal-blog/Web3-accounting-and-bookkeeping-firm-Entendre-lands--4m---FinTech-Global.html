   <p>The world of accounting and bookkeeping is swiftly changing with the advent of Web3 technology. The decentralization and transparency of the blockchain technology have opened new doors for businesses to manage their financial records more efficiently and securely.</p>
   <p>One of the pioneering firms in this field is Entendre. The firm has recently raised $4M in its latest funding round led by Blockchain Capital. The San Francisco-based startup uses Web3 technologies to provide accounting, bookkeeping, and tax services to businesses of all sizes.</p>
   <h2>An Interesting Story About Entendre's Success</h2>
   <p>One of Entendre's clients, a small coffee shop in San Francisco, was struggling with maintaining their financial records. They were using an outdated accounting software that was prone to errors and hacks. Moreover, they had to pay a hefty fee to a third-party accounting firm to manage their books.</p>
   <p>After switching to Entendre's blockchain-based accounting solution, the coffee shop owner was able to access accurate and up-to-date financial records in real-time. The owner could also monitor the transactions on the blockchain ledger, ensuring transparency and security. With Entendre's help, the coffee shop could streamline their accounting process and save money on costly fees.</p>
