    <h2>An Interesting Story on ChatBots</h2>
    <p>Recently, I had a conversation with a chatbot that was designed to provide legal advice. The chatbot's name was ChatGPT and it claimed to be able to answer any legal question I had. Intrigued by this, I decided to test it out with a question that I thought would stump it. I asked, "What is the legal definition of tort negligence?" To my surprise, the chatbot responded in a matter of seconds with a concise and accurate definition. Impressed, I continued to test the chatbot with more complex legal scenarios. While it was able to provide me with some basic information, I quickly realized that ChatGPT was not quite ready to be my lawyer.</p>

    <h2> ChatBot Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>Chatbots lack empathy and personalization. While they may provide a quick response, they cannot understand the emotional nature of legal issues. This means that a chatbot cannot offer support or guidance to someone going through a difficult legal situation.</li>
     <li>Chatbots are limited in their ability to provide legal advice. While they may offer a general understanding of legal concepts, they cannot provide tailored advice to a specific situation. This is because every legal scenario is unique and requires a personalized approach.</li>
     <li>Chatbots cannot replace human insight and judgment. Legal issues require a human touch, as every situation involves unique circumstances that may require a nuanced approach. A chatbot cannot provide the same level of judgement and insight that a human lawyer can.</li>
    </ul>
