   <p>Khabib Nurmagomedov isn't just a reigning UFC Lightweight Champion, he's also a shrewd businessman. In a recent Forbes interview, Nurmagomedov discussed how he's following in the footsteps of fellow fighter, Conor McGregor, when it comes to business ventures.</p>
   <p>McGregor is famously successful outside of the octagon, with a clothing line, whiskey brand, and a stint as a boxing champion among his many accomplishments. It seems that Nurmagomedov is keen to emulate this success.</p>
   <p>One of Nurmagomedov's ventures is an energy drink called Eagle Energy, which he co-founded with his cousins. The drink, which offers caffeine and vitamins without sugar, is marketed towards athletes and anyone needing a boost during the day. The company has even secured partnerships with UFC and MMA organizations.</p>
   <p>But Eagle Energy isn't the only business Nurmagomedov is involved in. He also has a stake in Fitroo, a Russian gym equipment manufacturer, and has expressed interest in opening his own gym franchise in the future.</p>
   <p>Nurmagomedov isn't the only fighter looking to capitalize on his success in the octagon. George St-Pierre has launched an app called GSP RUSHFIT that offers customized workouts and nutrition plans. Meanwhile, retired fighter Urijah Faber has his own gym franchise, Team Alpha Male, which has locations across the US.</p>
   <p>It's clear that fighters like Nurmagomedov and McGregor are taking a leaf out of the business playbook of successful athletes like Michael Jordan and LeBron James. By branching out into other industries and creating their own brands, they can secure financial stability long after their fighting careers are over.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>1. UFC fighters are increasingly looking to the world of business to secure their financial futures.<br>
     2. Khabib Nurmagomedov is following in the footsteps of Conor McGregor, with ventures such as Eagle Energy and Fitroo.<br>
     3. By extending their brands outside of UFC, fighters can continue to profit long after their retirement from the octagon.<br></p>
