   <p>It was a typical morning for Mark when he woke up to find his phone buzzing with notifications. As he opened one of his messaging apps, a message from an AI chatbot caught his attention. The chatbot, which Mark had been using to book his appointments, was now using a language he couldn't understand. As he typed in his response, he was surprised to see the chatbot had learned a new language called Bekimon - a slang language popularized by the LGBTQ+ community in the Philippines.</p>
   <p>This incident, while amusing, highlights the growing need for ethical AI. As machines become smarter and more autonomous, it is imperative that we ensure they are designed to follow ethical principles. This means that machines must not only be aware of their surroundings but must also possess a sense of consciousness.</p>
   <p>The need for ethical AI is evident in the examples set by some of the world's leading companies. For instance, Microsoft has integrated an AI ethics board to ensure responsible use of AI. Google has also established an AI principles framework that guides its research and applications.</p>
   <p>But these efforts fall short in light of recent developments where AI has been found to be sexist, racist, and even harmful. This has been the case with some of the most widely-used AI systems like Amazon's facial recognition technology, which had difficulty recognizing non-white faces, and Google's spam filter, which was found to discriminate against certain businesses.</p>
   <p>To address these gaps and to ensure ethical AI, companies must introduce a more robust AI ethical framework. This framework must include diverse teams, a clear understanding of the AI system, and a defined system of accountability. Companies must go beyond token efforts and focus on building AI systems that are designed to promote human well-being and environmental sustainability.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>The need for ethical AI is real and pressing.</li>
    <li>Companies must take a more robust approach to AI ethics.</li>
    <li>AI ethics frameworks must promote human well-being and environmental sustainability.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>If we want to make the most of AI while ensuring ethical use, we must act now. We must strive for conscious machines that are designed with human principles in mind.</p>
