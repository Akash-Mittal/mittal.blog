  <h2>An interesting Story</h2> Mary had always dreamed of having a family, but when her son was born, she felt overwhelmed with anxiety and guilt. She tried to hide her feelings but felt she was failing as a mother. She reached out to NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) for support and found a community of parents who had experienced similar challenges. They helped Mary understand that mental health challenges are common, and seeking help is a sign of strength. Mary now feels more confident and equipped to support her son's mental health needs. 
   According to the National Institute of Mental Health, 1 in 5 children experience a mental health disorder, and 50% of all lifetime mental illnesses begin by age 14. Despite these statistics, many parents struggle to identify and address their children's mental health needs. Only 20% of children with mental health disorders receive the proper treatment and support they need. NAMI's Parenting Mental Health Event aims to change this by providing parents with resources and strategies to support their children's mental wellness. In 2020, NAMI hosted events in 42 states, reaching over 11,000 parents and caregivers.
