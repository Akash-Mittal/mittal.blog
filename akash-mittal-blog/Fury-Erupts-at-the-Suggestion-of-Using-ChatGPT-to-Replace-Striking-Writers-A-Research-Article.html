   <p>It was supposed to be just a suggestion, but it sparked a controversy that went viral.</p>
   <p>The suggestion was made by a tech expert at a major media company. He proposed using ChatGPT, an AI language model developed by OpenAI, to replace the striking writers. The idea was to have the AI generate news stories, articles, and even scripts for TV shows and movies.</p>
   <p>The reaction was swift and furious. Writers' unions and their supporters took to social media to express their outrage. They argued that using AI to replace human writers would be a betrayal of the creative process and would lead to a decline in quality.</p>
   <p>But the tech expert and his supporters fired back. They argued that AI could actually improve quality by eliminating bias, increasing speed, and enabling new forms of creativity. They pointed to real-life examples of AI-generated content that had already been successful, such as The Washington Post's Heliograf and the AI-written movie script "Sunspring."</p>
   <p>The debate raged on for days, with both sides making compelling arguments and citing academic research to support their positions. But in the end, the writers' unions prevailed. The media company decided not to use ChatGPT or any other AI model to replace the striking writers.</p>
   <p>The controversy, however, raised important questions about the future of AI in media and entertainment. Will AI eventually replace human writers? Or will they find a way to coexist and collaborate?</p>
