   <p>It is no longer news that the world is fast transitioning from the physical to the digital. Even big players in the automobile industry have caught the bug, with Mercedes Benz launching their Web3 Arm that seeks to connect their digital offering to the blockchain. In a bid to imprint their name in the history of the burgeoning blockchain industry, Mercedes Benz is collaborating with the digital art community Fingerprints DAO to launch an NFT collection that would feature astounding artwork from top-tier artists.</p>
   <p>The Mercedes Benz Web3 Arm NFT Collection would be a major shakeup to the blockchain industry. The collection boasts of some of the world's most illustrious artists, who have been tasked with creating artwork that visually represents the Mercedes Benz brand. These works of art would be released on the blockchain for potential buyers to bid on and accumulate. As usual with NFT collections, the pieces would be exclusive and scarce, making it a unique opportunity for buyers who can afford it. This article provides insight into the Mercedes Benz Web3 Arm NFT Collection and why everyone needs to be a part of it.</p>
   <h2>Impeccable curation of NFTs</h2>
   <p>The Mercedes Benz Web3 Arm NFT Collection is curated by Fingerprints DAO, a digital art community that has created phenomenal works of NFT for renowned brands. Fingerprints DAO is a partner that has shown immense interest in the Mercedes Benz brand and would ensure that the NFT collection transcends the expectations of the blockchain community. It is essential to have a reputable name handling the curation of this collection, and Fingerprints DAO has been outstanding in recent years, raising over $2.5 million in investments from top-tier venture capitalists. It shows that they have a bit of experience and financial heft, which goes a long way in boosting interest in the collection.</p>
   <p>The Mercedes Benz Web3 Arm NFT Collection would showcase the uniqueness of art in the digital space. The works of art would not be typical of the automaker's branding; it is more of an interpretation of the brand's essence. The NFT collection would feature various mediums ranging from video installations to music. In essence, the NFT collection is artistically refreshing and would attract interest from collectors who seek to buy and collect engaging art. Given the quality of work, it is expected that the Mercedes Benz Web3 Arm NFT Collection could set new price records, especially if some of the most expensive NFTs get scooped up by high net worth buyers.</p>
   <h2>Buying into the Mercedes Benz NFT collection</h2>
   <p>The idea of owning an NFT that features Mercedes Benz branding is enough motivation for crypto enthusiasts to consider buying into the collection. However, owning an NFT does not entirely rest on a desire to own a piece of digital art. It involves making sure you're not acquiring a worthless piece of work. To minimize such risks, buyers need to conduct due diligence before going all-in on the Mercedes Benz Web3 Arm NFT Collection. For instance, buyers should check the artist's reputation and sales history to estimate the potential resale value of the NFT. It is an essential step to take as it does not bode well when you purchase an artwork that hardly commands a fraction of its value months after buying.</p>
   <p>It's worth noting that owning Mercedes Benz Web3 Arm NFT Collection is not only a medium to appreciate art but also an investment opportunity primarily if you acquire more than one NFT. The NFT market is volatile, and prices can fluctuate just as it does in the crypto market. For instance, the CryptoPunk 5293 was acquired for $67,000 in 2020, and a year later, it sold for $7.5 million. It's all in the anticipation of the NFT's value in the near or distant future.</p>
