  </header>
  <main>
   <p>Kim Kardashian is no stranger to the spotlight. As one of the most recognizable people in the world, her every move is scrutinized by fans and critics alike. But behind the glamorous facade, Kim is just like any other parent - dealing with the ups and downs of raising children in the modern world.</p>
   <h3>A Personal Story</h3>
   <p>Kim recently shared a personal story about one of the challenges she faces as a parent - managing her children's screen time. "It's tough, because as a working mom, I need to be able to take conference calls and answer emails throughout the day, but I also want to make sure my kids aren't glued to their devices all the time," she said.</p>
   <p>To help strike a balance, Kim has implemented a set of rules in her household. "We have designated times when the kids can play on their tablets or watch TV, but we try to keep it to a minimum," she explained. "We also encourage them to do more hands-on activities like playing outside or doing arts and crafts."</p>
   <h3>Quantifiable Examples</h3>
   <p>Kim's struggle with screen time is just one example of the parenting challenges many celebrities face. But there are others, like dealing with paparazzi and managing a hectic schedule. Here are a few quantifiable examples:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>According to a survey by the American Academy of Pediatrics, children under the age of 2 spend an average of 42 minutes per day on mobile devices. For children between 2 and 5, that number jumps to over 2 hours per day.</li>
    <li>A study by the University of Sussex found that the constant bombardment of paparazzi cameras can have a significant negative impact on a child's mental health.</li>
    <li>Research by the American Psychological Association shows that children of working mothers often experience higher levels of stress and anxiety than children of stay-at-home mothers.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Practical Tips</h3>
   <p>So how do Kim and other celebrity parents manage these challenges? Here are some practical tips:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Set clear boundaries around screen time, including designated times when devices are allowed and ensuring children are not using devices before bed.</li>
    <li>Work with security teams or law enforcement to ensure paparazzi do not trespass on private property or violate any laws.</li>
    <li>Delegate tasks and responsibilities to trusted family members, friends or assistants to help manage a hectic schedule.</li>
    <li>Be open and honest with your children about the realities of fame and privacy, and work with them to navigate any negative effects that may arise.</li>
    <li>Make time for self-care and prioritize mental health, both for yourself and your children.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Conclusion</h3>
   <p>Being a parent is never easy, but for celebrities like Kim Kardashian, the challenges can be even greater. When it comes to screen time, paparazzi, and busy schedules, there are steps you can take to manage the ups and downs. By setting clear boundaries, delegating tasks, and prioritizing mental health, celebrity parents can navigate the challenges of modern parenthood with grace and poise.</p>
