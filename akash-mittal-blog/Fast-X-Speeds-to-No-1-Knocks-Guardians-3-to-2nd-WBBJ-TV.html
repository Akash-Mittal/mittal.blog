   <p>It was another weekend of fierce competition at the box office as the highly anticipated release of 'Fast X Speeds to No.1' knocked 'Guardians 3' from its spot at the top of the charts, bringing in an impressive $125 million in its opening weekend.</p>
   <p>The franchise has come a long way since its first film in 2001, with each subsequent movie outdoing the last in terms of action, stunts, and star power. But what is it about 'Fast X Speeds to No.1' that made it such a resounding success?</p>
   <h2>The Formula for Success</h2>
   <p>One reason for the movie's success is the sheer number of big-name stars it boasts, from Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson to Charlize Theron and Helen Mirren. Fans of the franchise have grown attached to these characters over the years and eagerly anticipate each new installment to see what they'll be up to next.</p>
   <p>Another notable factor is the action-packed sequences that keep audiences on the edge of their seats. From high-speed car chases to jaw-dropping fight scenes, 'Fast X Speeds to No.1' delivers the adrenaline-fueled thrills that fans of the franchise have come to expect.</p>
   <p>But it's not just the action that keeps fans coming back for more. At its core, the franchise is about family, loyalty, and the power of friendship. Despite their past conflicts, the characters in 'Fast X Speeds to No.1' always have each other's backs, and audiences respond to that sense of camaraderie and solidarity.</p>
   <h2>The Impact on the Box Office</h2>
   <p>The success of 'Fast X Speeds to No.1' has been phenomenal, not just in terms of its opening weekend box office numbers, but also in terms of its global reach. The movie has already grossed over $400 million worldwide, and is showing no signs of slowing down anytime soon.</p>
   <p>Another notable impact is the knock-on effect it has had on other movies competing for box office dollars. 'Guardians 3', which had been sitting atop the charts for weeks, was knocked down to second place, bringing in a mere $25 million in its most recent weekend. Other movies, such as 'A Quiet Place 2' and 'Cruella', also saw a drop in ticket sales as audiences flocked to see 'Fast X Speeds to No.1' instead.</p>
   <h2>What's Next for the Franchise?</h2>
   <p>With the success of 'Fast X Speeds to No.1', it's no surprise that plans are already in the works for the next installment in the franchise. 'Fast and Furious 10' is set to hit theaters in 2022, and is sure to be another action-packed adventure that fans won't want to miss.</p>
   <p>One thing that's for certain is that the franchise shows no signs of slowing down. With each new movie, audiences continue to be captivated by the high-octane action, lovable characters, and themes of family and friendship. It's a formula for success that will likely continue to keep 'Fast X' at the top of the charts for years to come.</p>
