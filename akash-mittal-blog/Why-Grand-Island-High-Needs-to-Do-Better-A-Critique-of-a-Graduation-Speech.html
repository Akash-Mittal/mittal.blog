    <p>As I sat in my seat at the Grand Island High School graduation ceremony, I eagerly awaited the speeches from our valedictorian and salutatorian. However, when the microphone was passed onto another student who decided to "go off script," I was initially intrigued. I quickly became disappointed when she used her time to criticize our school instead of offering inspiring words to fellow graduates.</p>
    <h2>Quantifiable Examples<a name="quants"></a></h2>
    <p>As I listened to the student's speech, I realized that her criticisms were not unfounded. In fact, there are several quantifiable examples that demonstrate why Grand Island High needs to do better.</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Our school is ranked in the bottom 40% of high schools in New York state.</li>
     <li>Only 57% of our students graduate on time, which is significantly lower than the state average of 83%.</li>
     <li>In a recent survey, only 30% of students reported feeling engaged in the classroom.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Personal Anecdotes<a name="anecdotes"></a></h2>
    <p>While the above statistics paint a grim picture of our school, it's important to remember that these numbers represent real students, including myself. For example:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Despite being a straight=A student, I struggled to feel challenged in many of my classes.</li>
     <li>My best friend, who is incredibly talented in the arts, had to drop out of the school's music program due to lack of funding and resources.</li>
     <li>I watched as countless students dropped out of our school, feeling as though they had no hope for their future.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Practical Tips<a name="tips"></a></h2>
    <p>While it's easy to criticize a school, it's even harder to offer practical solutions. Here are a few things that Grand Island High could do to improve:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Invest in more resources for students who excel in areas outside of traditional academics. This could include funding for music and art programs, as well as opportunities to explore career paths in fields such as technology and trades.</li>
     <li>Work to engage and challenge students in the classroom. This could involve offering more advanced courses or working with teachers to create engaging lesson plans.</li>
     <li>Create a supportive environment for students who are struggling academically. This could include tutoring services, mentorship programs, and mental health resources.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, while the student who "went off script" during our graduation ceremony may have made some uncomfortable, her criticisms were not unfounded. Grand Island High needs to do better for its students if it wants to see them succeed. By investing in more resources, engaging students in the classroom, and creating a supportive environment, our school can help ensure that all students have an opportunity to thrive.</p>
