   <h2>What is ChatGPT?</h2>
   <p>ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence language model created by OpenAI. It can answer questions, generate text, and even have conversations with people. And now, thanks to a new integration, ChatGPT can also help you with your Excel spreadsheets.</p>
   <h2>How Does ChatGPT Work with Excel?</h2>
   <p>Using ChatGPT with Excel is easy. You simply type your question or problem into the chat window, and ChatGPT will generate a response. For example, if you're having trouble with a formula, you can ask ChatGPT for help. It will provide you with an explanation of how the formula works and even give you an example.</p>
   <p>ChatGPT can also help you with more complex tasks, such as data analysis. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to generate a chart or graph based on your data, and it will do so automatically.</p>
   <h2>Quantifiable Examples</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Users who integrated ChatGPT with Excel reported a 25% increase in productivity.</li>

But when I started using ChatGPT, I felt much more confident. I knew that if I had a question or wasn't sure about something, I could just ask ChatGPT for help. And it always provided me with a clear and concise response.</p>
   <p>My friend Melanie runs a small business, and she was struggling to keep track of her finances using Excel.
