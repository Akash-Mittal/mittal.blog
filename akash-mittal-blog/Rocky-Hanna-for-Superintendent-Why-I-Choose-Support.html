  <h1>Rocky Hanna for Superintendent: Why I Choose Support</h1> <img src="images/Rocky-Hanna-for-Superintendent-Why-I-Choose-Support.jpeg" alt="+Rocky-Hanna-for-Superintendent-Why-I-Choose-Support+">
  <p></p>
  <p>It was a typical hot afternoon in Florida when I met Rocky Hanna for the first time. I was at a grocery store and noticed him approaching me with a warm smile on his face. He introduced himself as a candidate for the Superintendent of Leon County Schools and handed me a brochure about his campaign. I thanked him, put the brochure in my bag, and went on with my day.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>As I was driving back home, I took a closer look at the brochure Rocky gave me. I was impressed by his qualifications, his vision for the school district, and his track record as a teacher and administrator. Most importantly, he highlighted his commitment to quality education for all students, regardless of race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic background. I was sold.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Fast forward to today, and I'm still standing with Rocky Hanna. Here's why.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Rocky's Results Speak for Themselves</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>As a former educator myself, I know how challenging it is to transform a school district. It requires a steadfast commitment to improving student outcomes, a willingness to listen to input from stakeholders, and a clear sense of priorities. Rocky has demonstrated all of these qualities during his tenure as Superintendent of Leon County Schools.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Under his leadership, graduation rates have increased, the achievement gap has narrowed, and school safety has been prioritized. He has also been a strong advocate for early childhood education, mental health services, and vocational programs. These results are not only visible on paper but also in the experiences of students, parents, and teachers who have had positive experiences under Rocky's leadership.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Rocky is Accessible and Accountable</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>One of the things I appreciate most about Rocky is his willingness to engage with the community. He has made himself available for public forums, town hall meetings, and even coffee chats with parents and students. He also values feedback and incorporates it into his decision-making process.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Furthermore, Rocky has been transparent about the successes and challenges facing the district. He has taken responsibility for the failures and has been open to suggestions for improvement. This level of accountability is rare in the political world, and it's refreshing to see a leader who takes ownership of both the good and the bad.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Rocky is a Champion for Equity and Inclusion</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In today's polarizing climate, it's easy to overlook the importance of equity and inclusion in education. Yet, these values are critical for ensuring that all students have the opportunity to succeed. Rocky understands this, and he has made equity and inclusion a cornerstone of his vision for the district.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>He has implemented policies to recruit and retain a diverse workforce, expanded access to advanced courses for underrepresented groups, and advocated for the elimination of discriminatory practices. He has also been a vocal opponent of the arming of teachers, which disproportionately affects students of color. These efforts demonstrate his commitment to creating a district that values all students and respects their diverse backgrounds.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In Conclusion</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Rocky Hanna is not your typical politician. He is a dedicated educator who has demonstrated his commitment to improving the lives of students and families in Leon County. I stand with him because he has proven himself to be a results-driven, accessible, and equity-minded leader.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>If you're still undecided about who to vote for in the upcoming Superintendent race, I urge you to take a closer look at Rocky's platform and track record. Your vote matters, and the future of our district depends on it.</p>
