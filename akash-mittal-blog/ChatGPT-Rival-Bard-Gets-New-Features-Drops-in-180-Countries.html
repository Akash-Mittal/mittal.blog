    <h2>New Features</h2>
    <p>Bard has recently rolled out a host of new features that make the app even more user-friendly. For example, now you can invite team members to join a conversation without having to create a new one. Additionally, they've added custom notifications so that you receive alerts when specific keywords are mentioned, making it easy to stay on top of important topics. They've also improved their search function, so you can quickly find specific messages or conversations, and added the ability to react to messages, similar to Facebook's emojis.</p>
    <p>Another significant improvement that Bard has made is the ability to integrate with third-party apps. You can now add links to other apps within your Bard conversations, allowing you to share documents and other relevant information without having to switch between platforms. This is a great time saver, and we all know how valuable time is in today's fast-paced world. With these new additions, Bard is quickly becoming the messaging app of choice for businesses.</p>

    <h2>Drops Waitlist in 180 Countries</h2>
    <p>One of the biggest challenges with new messaging apps is building a user base. However, Bard has found a way around this by creating a waitlist and generating a high demand for their app. But, once word got out about the new features and functionality, they knew they had to open up their doors to everyone. And they did just that - removing their waitlist in 180 countries. This meant the app was now available to everyone, and as a result, they saw massive growth in user numbers. The success of Bard demonstrates the power of hype and buzz in generating excitement around new apps.</p>
    <p>In a recent interview with Bard CEO, Rishi Sharma, he explained how the company was able to drop the waitlist and generate such excitement. "We focused on building a product that people would love using, and once we had built that product, we started reaching out to press and influencers to help spread the word. We also offered early access to those who signed up for our waitlist, which created a sense of exclusivity and urgency around our app."</p>
