     <p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. has applied for a patent on a new technology that uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to provide investment advice to clients. The technology, called "ChatGPT" (short for "Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer"), is similar to the chatbots and virtual assistants that many people have become familiar with in their daily lives.</p>
     <p>According to the patent application, ChatGPT is designed to "provide investment advice or other information to users based on conversational exchanges with the users." The technology uses NLP to parse user input and generate responses that are relevant and helpful.</p>
     <p>For example, a user might ask ChatGPT about a particular stock or investment strategy, and the system would respond with relevant information and analysis. The system might also provide personalized recommendations based on the user's financial goals and risk tolerance.</p>
     <blockquote>
      "With ChatGPT, JPMorgan is hoping to provide a more personalized and engaging experience for clients, while also increasing efficiency and reducing costs."
     </blockquote>
     <p>ChatGPT is just one example of how machine learning and artificial intelligence are transforming the financial industry. Other banks and financial institutions are also investing heavily in these technologies, in an effort to stay competitive and meet the evolving needs of their clients.</p>
