  </blockquote>
  <p>It's a miracle, some would say. The Lord has blessed the Mwenda family from Alabama with not one, but two sets of identical twins. The chances of having identical twins are rare enough, but the chances of that happening twice to the same parents are almost unimaginable.</p>
  <p>The first set of twins, Zuriel and Zion, was born in June 2019. The second set, Amara and Anaya, was born in August 2021. Both sets of twins were born prematurely and had to spend some time in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) before being discharged.</p>
  <h2>Quantifiable Examples</h2>
  <p>According to the National Organization of Rare Disorders (NORD), the incidence of identical twins is about 3.5 per 1,000 births worldwide, or about 0.35%. In contrast, the incidence of fraternal twins is about 13 per 1,000 births, or about 1.3%. The incidence of having two sets of identical twins is even rarer, with estimates ranging from 1 in 70,000 to 1 in a million.</p>
  <p>Identical twins occur when a fertilized egg splits into two embryos that share the same genetic material. This happens randomly and is not influenced by genetics or environmental factors. Fraternal twins, on the other hand, result from the fertilization of two separate eggs by two separate sperm cells, and may run in families.</p>
  <p>Multiple births, including twins, are associated with increased risk of complications during pregnancy and delivery, as well as increased risk of health problems for the babies, such as prematurity, low birth weight, and developmental delays. However, with proper prenatal care and medical intervention when necessary, many twins and multiples thrive and lead healthy lives.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>The birth of two sets of identical twins to the same parents is a rare and remarkable event that defies statistical odds and underscores the mystery and wonder of life.</li>
   <li>With proper medical care and support, twins and multiples can overcome the challenges associated with their birth and thrive as unique individuals.</li>
   <li>The Mwenda family's faith in God and gratitude for His blessings can inspire us to appreciate the miracles in our own lives and trust in the providence of the Divine.</li>
  </ul>
