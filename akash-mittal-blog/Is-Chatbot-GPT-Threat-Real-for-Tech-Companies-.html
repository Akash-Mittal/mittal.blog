    <p>It was a casual conversation between Dan Rosensweig, CEO of Chegg and a ChatGPT AI bot, hosted by Reuters on their video platform. But a single remark from Rosensweig turned the tables for Chegg, as well as for other tech companies relying on chatbots for their services.</p>
    <p>The remark in question was when Rosensweig said, "As AI gets better and the ability to really personalize and individualize the interaction between a student and an expert, what value does a tutor really have?" He then went on to praise the efficiency and effectiveness of chatbots over human tutors.</p>
    <p>The clip went viral within hours, and the investors' reaction was swift. Chegg's stock price plunged by 38%, wiping off millions of dollars from the company's value.</p>
    <p>The debate around the threat of ChatGPT and other AI chatbots to human jobs has been ongoing for a while. But this incident brought the issue to mainstream attention and sparked a wider discussion.</p>

    <ul>
     <li><a href="https://www.sephora.com/chatbot" target="_blank">Sephora</a> - A beauty company with a chatbot that can help customers find the right shade of lipstick and recommend products based on their skin type.</li>
     <li><a href="https://www.flo.health/" target="_blank">Flo.Health</a> - An app that helps women track their menstrual cycle, with a chatbot that can answer questions related to women's health.</li>
     <li><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" target="_blank">Duolingo</a> - A language learning platform with a chatbot that can converse with learners in the language they are trying to master and provide feedback on their progress.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>While chatbots have their advantages, they are not without their limitations. One of the biggest concerns is their potential to replace human jobs. As the technology improves and becomes more sophisticated, the debate on the chatbot threat will only become more prominent.</p>
    <p>Some argue that chatbots can enhance human capabilities and provide more efficient and personalized services, while others fear that it will lead to widespread job loss and digital exclusion for those who cannot adapt to the changing landscape.</p>
    <p>Regardless of which side of the debate one falls on, it is clear that the chatbot revolution is here to stay and will continue to reshape the service industry as we know it.</p>
