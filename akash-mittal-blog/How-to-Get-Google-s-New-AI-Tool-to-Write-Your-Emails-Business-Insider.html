    <h2>What is Google's AI Tool?</h2>
    <p>Google's AI tool, known as "Smart Compose," uses machine learning to suggest phrases and sentences in real-time as you type your emails. This means that you can write your emails faster and more efficiently than ever before.</p>
    <p>For example, if you start typing "Hey Jane," Smart Compose may suggest "Hey Jane, how are you doing today?" instead of forcing you to come up with a greeting from scratch. Smart Compose also takes into account the context of your email, such as the subject line and any previous emails in the thread, to make its suggestions more relevant.</p>

    <h2>How to Use Smart Compose</h2>
    <p>Using Smart Compose is easy and only requires a few simple steps.</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Open up your Gmail account in your web browser.</li>
     <li>Click on the Settings gear in the top right corner of the screen and select "Settings."</li>
     <li>Scroll down to the "Smart Compose" section and make sure the box is checked for "Writing suggestions on."</li>
     <li>Start writing a new email and watch as Smart Compose suggests phrases and sentences in real-time.</li>
     <li>Click on the suggestion you want to use and continue typing your email.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You can also disable Smart Compose at any time by following the same steps and unchecking the box for "Writing suggestions on."</p>

    <h2>Quantifiable Examples</h2>
    <p>There are several quantifiable examples that show how Smart Compose can improve your email writing efficiency:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>In a trial run, Smart Compose was able to save up to four seconds per email, which may not sound like much, but can really add up over the course of a busy work day.</li>
     <li>Smart Compose can also help you avoid embarrassing typos and grammatical errors, since it suggests complete phrases and sentences that are already grammatically correct.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Personal Anecdotes</h2>
    <p>One personal anecdote comes from John, a busy executive who tried out Smart Compose and found that it saved him a lot of time and hassle.</p>

     "I used to have to spend hours each week crafting the perfect emails to clients and colleagues. But with Smart Compose, I'm able to get my point across quickly and efficiently without sacrificing quality. It's like having a personal assistant right there in my inbox."
    </blockquote>
    <p>Another personal anecdote comes from Jane, a writer who was initially skeptical of Smart Compose but ended up loving it.</p>
    <blockquote>
     "At first, I was worried that Smart Compose would make my emails sound robotic or too formulaic. But I quickly realized that it actually helps me break out of my writing rut and come up with new and interesting phrases that I never would have thought of on my own."
