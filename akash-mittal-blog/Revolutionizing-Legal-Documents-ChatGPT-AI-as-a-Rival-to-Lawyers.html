It also needs to consider the human aspect of the agreement. AI may not be able to address these social and ethical issues that a human lawyer can represent.</li>

Human lawyers are still required to ensure that every clause and provision of the contract covers all aspects of the agreement.</li>
   <li>Legal industry disruption. ChatGPT AI has the potential to change the legal industry as we know it. It may reduce the need for human lawyers and lower the lawyer's salary range. It may affect the traditional law firms' business model and push them to adapt to the new technological paradigm.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The introduction of ChatGPT AI technology marks a significant milestone in the legal industry's evolution. It opens up a new way of generating legal documents that can save time and reduce costs.
