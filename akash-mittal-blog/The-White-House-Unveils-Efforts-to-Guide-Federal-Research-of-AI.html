   <p>Tom is a highly skilled surgeon who has been performing surgeries for over 20 years. He relies on his experience, knowledge, and skills to make critical decisions when operating on his patients. However, when a new surgical equipment using AI technology was introduced to his hospital, he was both fascinated and uncertain of how to use it. Tom was skeptical about the ability of the surgical AI system to perform procedures without human supervision.</p>
   <p>But as he began to use the system, he found that the AI technology helped him make more accurate diagnoses and minimize human error during surgeries. It was a partnership between Tom's experience and the AI technology that produced better patient outcomes.</p>
   
   <p>AI is already playing a crucial role in various industries, including healthcare, finance, and transportation. According to the research by McKinsey and Company, AI could contribute to global economic activity of $13 trillion by 2030. The same research also estimated that AI could create 20-25 million jobs worldwide, particularly in healthcare, education, and engineering sectors.</p>

   <h2> and Case Studies</h2>
   <p>Maria runs a customer service department at a telecommunications company. Before the implementation of AI-powered chatbots, her team received an average of 500 customer inquiries per day. The wait time to speak to a customer service representative was about 10-15 minutes. After deploying the AI chatbot technology, the number of inquiries reduced to 150 on average per day, and the waiting time reduced significantly to less than a minute. She also noted that the chatbot was able to solve 70% of the customers' issues without human intervention, allowing her team to focus on more complex issues that required higher-level input.</p>
   <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Organizations need to work on creating a skilled workforce specifically trained in AI technology.</li>
    <li>Develop AI best practices for planning, design, and deployment that includes human oversight, accountability, transparency, and security.</li>
    <li>Promote ethical frameworks for AI that respect individual privacy, cultural and societal values, and human rights principles.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2></h2>
   <ol>
    <li>The integration of AI into the federal government research agenda will increase innovation and productivity.</li>
    <li>The regulation of AI usage will be critical to ensure safety, privacy, and ethical behavior.</li>
    <li>The partnership between AI technology and human expertise has the potential to create a brighter future for all.</li>
