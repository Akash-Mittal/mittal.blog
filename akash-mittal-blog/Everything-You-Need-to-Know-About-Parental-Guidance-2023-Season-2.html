    <h2>The Story Behind Parental Guidance</h2>
    <p>It all started when executive producer Jane Smithson had a conversation with her daughter about raising a family in today's world. They talked about the challenges facing parents, from social media and screen time to marriage and family dynamics. Smithson realized there was a need for a TV show that tackled these issues head-on. With her years of experience in the entertainment industry, she knew she could make it happen.</p>
    <p>So, she gathered a team of experts in family therapy, child psychology, and parenting strategies, and created Parental Guidance. The show, which premiered in 2021, quickly gained a devoted following. Viewers loved the honest, practical advice and the real-life stories of families struggling with the same issues they faced.</p>
