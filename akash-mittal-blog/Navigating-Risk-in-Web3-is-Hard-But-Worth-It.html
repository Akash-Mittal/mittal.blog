    <p>Imagine you are an investor who has been closely following the developments of the Web3 ecosystem. You have seen the explosive growth of decentralized finance, the emergence of non-fungible tokens, and the promise of a decentralized internet. You are excited about the potential of these technologies to disrupt traditional industries and create new opportunities for innovation.</p>
    <p>However, as you begin to explore these opportunities, you quickly realize that navigating the risks inherent in this new and rapidly evolving field can be incredibly challenging.
