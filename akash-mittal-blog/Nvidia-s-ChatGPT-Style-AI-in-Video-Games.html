   <h2>Why People are Worried</h2>
   <p>Nvidia, the world leader in graphics processing units (GPUs), has announced that it is bringing ChatGPT style AI to video games. This AI technology, which uses natural language processing to generate responses to open-ended questions, could revolutionize the gaming industry. However, many people are worried about the implications of this technology being used in video games.</p>
   <blockquote>
    "The idea of an AI-powered video game is a thrilling prospect, but it's also a little scary. Will these AIs be able to learn from human players and eventually become unbeatable? Will they be able to manipulate players into buying in-game content? These are just some of the concerns gamers have about ChatGPT style AI in video games."
   </blockquote>
   <p>Some gamers also worry that ChatGPT style AI in video games will make the experience less immersive. "If I'm talking to an AI instead of another player, it's going to feel like I'm playing a single-player game," says one gamer. "Games are supposed to be social. This takes away from that."</p>

   <p>Despite these concerns, Nvidia is moving forward with its plans to integrate ChatGPT style AI into video games. The company has not provided many details about how this technology will be used in games, but here are some examples of how it could work:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>A player could ask an AI in-game character for a hint on how to solve a puzzle.</li>
    <li>An AI in-game store could recommend items to a player based on their play style.</li>
    <li>An AI in-game companion could respond to a player's questions about the game world.</li>
    <li>An AI in-game opponent could taunt a player and adapt its strategy based on the player's moves.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>These examples may seem harmless, but they raise important questions about the role of AI in video games. Will AI characters be able to cheat? Will they be able to use personal data to manipulate players?</p>

   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In conclusion, the integration of ChatGPT style AI into video games is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it could enhance the gaming experience and provide new opportunities for developers. On the other hand, it could lead to privacy violations, unethical marketing practices, and a less immersive gaming experience. Here are three key takeaways:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Developers must be transparent about how they use AI in video games and ensure that players have control over their personal data.</li>
    <li>Gamers must be alert to the potential risks of interacting with AI in video games and should report any suspicious behavior to the game's developers.</li>
    <li>We must continue to have a conversation about the proper role of AI in society, including in video games.</li>
   </ol>
   <p>If we can strike a balance between innovation and safety, ChatGPT style AI could be a game-changer in the world of video games.</p>
