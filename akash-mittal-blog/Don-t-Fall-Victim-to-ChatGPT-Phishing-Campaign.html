  <h1>Don't Fall Victim to ChatGPT Phishing Campaign</h1> <img src="images/Don-t-Fall-Victim-to-ChatGPT-Phishing-Campaign.jpeg" alt="+Don-t-Fall-Victim-to-ChatGPT-Phishing-Campaign+">
  <p>Online communication platforms have become an integral part of our lives. We use them for work, socializing, and even maintaining long-distance relationships. One of the popular platforms in recent years has been ChatGPT, which caters to individuals and businesses alike. However, as with any online service, there is always the risk of cyber attacks, including phishing campaigns.</p>

    <h2>What is a Phishing Campaign?</h2>
    <p><img src="https://img.icons8.com/material/24/000000/security-checked--v1.png">Security</p>
   </div>
   <p>A phishing campaign is an attempt by cybercriminals to gain access to sensitive information such as banking and login credentials, personal information, or even money. The attackers use various methods to trick individuals into clicking on a malicious link or providing their information to the hackers. These methods include sending emails that appear to be from legitimate sources, creating fake websites that mimic legitimate ones, and even using social engineering tactics to gain trust.</p>
   <p>Phishing campaigns can be very effective, and their success rate continues to grow because of the use of increasingly sophisticated techniques. The attackers prey on human psychology by creating a sense of urgency or using a believable pretext to make the victim feel comfortable enough to provide their information. For instance, the ChatGPT phishing campaign targets ChatGPT users where the scammer poses as a ChatGPT representative and asks the user to verify their account details to avoid being locked out of their account. The attackers use this technique to trick users into sharing their login credentials, which the hackers can use to gain access to their account.</p>
