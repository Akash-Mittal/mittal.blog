   <p>Web 3.0 is not just limited to finance. It is also transforming the healthcare sector. One company that is using blockchain technology to revolutionize healthcare in India is Shivom. It is a platform that allows users to securely store their genetic data on the blockchain. This data can be used for research purposes and can help advance medical research.</p>
   <p>Web 3.0 is going to be a game-changer for India. It is going to create new opportunities and unlock new markets. India has the talent and the resources to lead the Web 3.0 revolution and become a blockchain superpower.</p>
