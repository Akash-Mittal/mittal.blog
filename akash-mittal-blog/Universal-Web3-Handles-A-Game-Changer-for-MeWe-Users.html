     <h3>The Struggle of Managing Multiple Social Media Accounts</h3>
     <p>It was becoming overwhelming for Lisa to manage her multiple social media accounts. She had a Facebook account for her personal interactions, a Twitter account to join conversations of her favorite topics, an Instagram account to share pictures with her friends, and a LinkedIn account for her professional networking. She had to remember different usernames, passwords, and security questions for each platform, and often found herself logging in and out several times a day to check notifications.</p>
     <p>This is where Universal Web3 Handles come in. They provide an all-in-one solution where users can access all their social media accounts with just one handle. MeWe users can create their Universal Web3 Handle and connect their different accounts to it. This eliminates the need to remember different usernames and passwords for each account, and switching between accounts is just as easy as flipping a switch.</p>
