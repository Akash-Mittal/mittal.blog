  <p>From the moment we become parents, we face an endless stream of responsibilities and challenges. Trying to raise successful and happy children can seem overwhelming at times, but we are not alone on this journey. There are countless resources available to us, including expert advice from experienced parents like Mathew Knowles.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Mathew Knowles is a highly successful music executive, being the former manager of Destiny's Child and his daughter Beyoncé's career. However, what some people might not know is that he is also a devoted father and grandfather. Recently, he shared some valuable insights and tips on parenting during a virtual event hosted by LBS (Lagos Business School) Alumni Association.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Here's what Mathew had to say.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>An Interesting Story</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Mathew shared an interesting story about his daughter Beyoncé when she was a young girl. One day, she asked him to buy her a pair of shoes that were on trend at the time. Mathew said no and instead bought her a pair of shoes that were more practical and sturdy. Beyoncé was upset in the moment, but she eventually came to appreciate her father's decision. Mathew's message is clear: sometimes it's up to parents to make tough decisions and say no, even if it's not the most popular choice in the moment.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable Examples</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Mathew shared some quantifiable examples that parents could use to gauge their children's success. For example, he believes that if your child is not reading at grade level by the end of third grade, it's cause for concern. The same goes for math— if they are not proficient in math by the end of ninth grade, it may be an indicator of struggles down the line. Mathew emphasized the role of education in shaping a child's future opportunities and encouraged parents to prioritize their children's learning.</p>
