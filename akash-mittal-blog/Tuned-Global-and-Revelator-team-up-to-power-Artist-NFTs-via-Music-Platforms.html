  <h1>Tuned Global and Revelator team up to power Artist NFTs via Music Platforms</h1> <img src="images/Tuned-Global-and-Revelator-team-up-to-power-Artist-NFTs-via-Music-Platforms.jpeg" alt="+Tuned-Global-and-Revelator-team-up-to-power-Artist-NFTs-via-Music-Platforms+">
  <p>Once upon a time, musicians relied on record sales to make a living. But as the music industry evolved, so did the revenue streams of artists. With the emergence of live performances, merchandise sales, and streaming services, artists now have more ways to monetize their craft. And with the rise of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), artists now have a new avenue for generating revenue.</p>
  <p>For those unfamiliar, NFTs are a type of digital asset (often tied to art, music or other creative works) that are verified on a blockchain. This means that they are one-of-a-kind and cannot be replicated or forged.</p>
  <p>Recognizing the potential power of NFTs, Tuned Global and Revelator have teamed up to help artists sell NFTs via music platforms.</p>
  <h2>The Power of NFTs for Artists</h2>
  <p>NFTs offer several benefits for artists:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Unique: Each NFT is one-of-a-kind, making it a rare collectible that fans can't get anywhere else.</li>
   <li>Smart Contracts: NFTs are verified on a blockchain, which allows for automated royalty payments and other smart contract-based transactions.</li>
   <li>Ownership: Fans who buy NFTs own a piece of the digital asset, which can then be sold or traded on a secondary market.</li>
   <li>Revenue: Selling NFTs can help artists generate additional revenue streams beyond traditional music sales and touring.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>However, selling NFTs is not without its challenges. For one, the process can be complex and technical, which may deter some artists. Additionally, there is a learning curve for both artists and fans who may not be familiar with NFTs or blockchain technology.</p>
  <h2>The Solution: Tuned Global and Revelator Team Up</h2>
  <p>Tuned Global is a music streaming and technology company that provides white-label streaming services to businesses. Revelator is a blockchain-based platform for managing digital assets, including NFTs.</p>
  <p>Together, Tuned and Revelator are partnering to help artists sell NFTs via music platforms. The goal is to make the process as simple and user-friendly as possible for both artists and fans.</p>
  <p>According to Tuned, the process will be as follows:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>An artist signs up with Tuned and Revelator to create and sell NFTs.</li>
   <li>The artist creates an NFT for one of their songs or other creative work.</li>
   <li>Tuned and Revelator handle the technical aspects of creating and verifying the NFT on a blockchain.</li>
   <li>The NFT is sold to a fan via a music platform (powered by Tuned).</li>
   <li>The fan now owns a piece of the digital asset and can sell or trade it on a secondary market.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>With this partnership, Tuned and Revelator aim to make it easy for artists to sell NFTs, while also providing fans with a new way to support their favorite artists.</p>
  
  <p>While the partnership between Tuned and Revelator is still in its early stages, there are already several examples of artists successfully selling NFTs.</p>
  <p>For example, electronic musician 3LAU recently sold an album's worth of NFTs for $11.6 million. Each NFT was tied to a specific song and included exclusive bonus content, such as unreleased tracks and access to VIP experiences.</p>
  <p>In another example, musician and producer Deadmau5 sold an NFT for $6,000 that included exclusive rights to a one-of-a-kind digital art piece and a VIP experience at one of his shows.</p>
  <p>These are just two examples of the potential revenue-generating power of NFTs for artists. With the partnership between Tuned and Revelator, even more artists will be able to tap into this new revenue stream.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Here are three key takeaways from Tuned and Revelator's partnership:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>NFTs offer a new revenue stream for artists beyond traditional music sales and touring.</li>
   <li>While the technical aspects of creating and selling NFTs can be complex, Tuned and Revelator aim to simplify the process for artists and fans.</li>
   <li>The success of artists like 3LAU and Deadmau5 show that there is real potential for NFTs in the music industry.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>As the music industry continues to evolve, it's clear that artists need to be creative in finding new ways to monetize their craft. With NFTs, artists have an opportunity to offer fans something truly unique that cannot be replicated. And with Tuned and Revelator's partnership, the process of creating and selling NFTs is becoming more accessible than ever.</p>
