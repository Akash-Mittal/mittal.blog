   <p>Are we really ready for AI-led classrooms?</p>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>As a teacher, I was initially skeptical of the idea of incorporating artificial intelligence, or "teaching bots," into classrooms. But then I experienced a single moment that made me comprehend how advanced this disruptive technology has become – I saw my eight-year-old daughter working on her math homework with the help of an AI-powered robot.</p>
   <p>Despite my initial reservations, I came to realize that AI-led teaching has the potential to revolutionize education by tailoring to the needs of individual students and automating routine tasks for teachers.</p>
   <p>However, as school leaders warn, AI also poses a real and present danger to education and the future of our youth. While AI technology has come a long way in the past few years, it is not yet perfect. There are both empirical and anecdotal cases highlighting AI technology's fallibility.</p>
   <h2> AI's impact on Education</h2>
   <p>Here are some of the quantifiable examples that highlight the impact AI is already having on education:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>AI is already being used in various capacities, such as grading systems, automated essay scoring, and even in the creation of entire lesson plans.</li>
    <li>According to the Pew Research Center, "Experts anticipate that robotics and AI will permeate wide segments of daily life by 2025, with huge implications for a range of industries such as health care, transport and logistics, customer service, and home maintenance."</li>
    <li>At present, AI tools are being implemented on a limited scale, with several studies indicating that the technology has increased learning and retention rates for certain academic subjects.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>The Threats Posed by AI to Education</h2>
   <p>Despite the obvious benefits of AI, there are several possible threats that it poses to education:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>AI lacks the emotional intelligence required to effectively teach social skills and ethical decision-making skills. Qualities such as empathy, creativity, and critical thinking are difficult, if not impossible, to be replicated by an algorithm.</li>
    <li>AI has the potential to perpetuate inequalities through data bias. The algorithms developed by AI software are only as good as the data fed into it. Therefore, if the data used to train an AI is biased, the resulting algorithms will be biased. This bias could perpetuate long-standing systems of inequality and discrimination.</li>
    <li>AI-led classrooms may lead to the depersonalization of education – turning students into mere numbers and data points rather than individuals with unique learning styles, preferences, and abilities.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>As with any disruptive technology, AI has its pros and cons. However, the dangers that currently exist must be addressed. It is essential that educators and policymakers engage in conversations to discuss the broader societal implications of AI, including its impact on our educational system.</p>
   <p>To avoid the risks and reap the benefits of AI-powered education, educators must be willing to evolve their teaching styles and embrace the new tools at their disposal. Students must be trained not just to use technology but to critique and understand it. Failure to prepare future generations for a future dominated by AI could render us all obsolete.</p>
