    <p>American taxpayers have been victims of a new type of scam that involves chatbots or AI-generated voices impersonating the IRS. These chatbots are designed to mislead people into giving away their personal information, such as Social Security numbers, in order to access their bank accounts or file fraudulent tax returns. This has become a problem for the IRS and the American people, as fraudsters have already stolen billions of dollars.</p>
    <h2>A Real-Life Example</h2>
    <p>One example of this is a case in which a woman received a call from someone claiming to be from the IRS. The caller informed her that she had back taxes and needed to pay immediately to avoid jail time. The woman was scared and didn't want to go to jail, so she complied and gave away her personal information.</p>
    <h2>The Main Companies Involved</h2>
    <ul>
     <li><a href="https://www.irs.gov/" target="_blank">IRS</a></li>
     <li><a href="https://www.chatgpt.com/" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a></li>
