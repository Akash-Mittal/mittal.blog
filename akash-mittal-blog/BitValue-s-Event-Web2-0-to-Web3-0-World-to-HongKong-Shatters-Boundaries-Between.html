    <p>It was a sunny day in HongKong, and I was attending BitValue's event on the transition from Web2.0 to Web3.0 world. There were some of the biggest names in the industry sharing their insights and opinions on the future of technology. But what caught my attention the most was a young couple sitting next to me.</p>
    <p>They looked like they were in their mid-twenties and were dressed casually. During the event, I noticed that they were paying close attention to every speaker and taking notes. After the event, I approached them and asked about their interest in the topic. They shared that they were early investors in several cryptocurrency projects and were here to learn more about the technology behind it.</p>
    <p>This made me realize that the audience for such events is not just limited to industry experts or professionals. It is a growing community of young people who are passionate about the future of technology and investing.</p>

    <p>The BitValue's event was filled with quantifiable examples of how the technology is shaping the world. One of the speakers, a blockchain expert, shared that the total market capitalization of the crypto space has reached over $2 trillion in just a few years. This showcases the exponential growth and the opportunity for innovation in the industry.</p>
    <p>Another quantifiable example shared was about the rise of decentralized applications (dApps). It was stated that there are currently over 3,500 dApps on the Ethereum network alone, and the numbers are growing at a rapid pace. This highlights the potential of blockchain technology to disrupt the current centralized systems.</p>
