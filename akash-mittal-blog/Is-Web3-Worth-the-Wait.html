  <p></p>
  <p>The year was 2017 and a new technology was making its way into the world. Ethereum and its blockchain technology had captured the attention of investors and developers alike. Many believed that Web3, the next generation of the internet, was on the horizon. It promised to revolutionize the way we interact with each other, our data, and our devices. However, four years have passed and Web3 has yet to fully materialize. So, is Web3 worth the wait?</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable Examples</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Before we can answer that question, let's take a look at some quantifiable examples of current Web3 projects.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Firstly, the NFT market. Non-Fungible Tokens, or NFTs, have taken the world by storm, with sales skyrocketing in 2021. According to DappRadar, the daily trading volume of NFTs on Ethereum reached an all-time high of $250 million in May 2021. This shows that people are willing to pay for unique and scarce digital assets.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Secondly, decentralized finance (DeFi) has grown tremendously in the past year. DeFi protocols on Ethereum now hold over $150 billion in total value locked, according to DeFi Pulse. This shows that people are willing to trust decentralized systems for financial services.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Lastly, the metaverse has gained significant attention recently. Facebook announced that they will rebrand as Meta and focus on building a metaverse. Decentraland, a virtual world built on Ethereum, recently sold a virtual plot of land for over $2.4 million. This shows that people are interested in immersive virtual experiences.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p>So, back to the question at hand. Is Web3 worth the wait? The answer is yes, but with a caveat.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Web3 has the potential to revolutionize many industries, but it will not happen overnight. It will take time and investment to build the necessary infrastructure and for people to adopt these new technologies.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Conclusion in 3 points</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Here are three reasons why Web3 is worth the wait:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Web3 can provide a more decentralized internet, giving users more control over their data and privacy.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Web3 can unlock new revenue streams for creators and businesses.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Web3 can create new immersive experiences for users, such as the metaverse.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p>To illustrate these points further, let's look at some personal anecdotes.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>As someone who has worked in social media marketing for several years, I have seen firsthand how centralized platforms can change their algorithms and policies overnight, leaving creators scrambling. Web3 can provide a more stable and decentralized platform for creators to earn revenue and build communities.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Another anecdote is from a friend who works in finance. They are excited about DeFi and the potential it has to disrupt the traditional financial system. The fact that these platforms are decentralized and transparent gives them more faith in the system.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Practical Tips</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>If you are interested in getting involved in Web3, here are some practical tips:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Start by learning about the technology and its potential use cases.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Join communities and forums to connect with others in the space.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Invest in projects you believe in, but do your due diligence.</p>
