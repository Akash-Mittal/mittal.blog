  </header>
  <main>
   <p>In December 2019, the former Nissan CEO, Carlos Ghosn, made an escape from Japan where he was facing financial misconduct charges. The escape was orchestrated by his team and involved hiding him in a double bass case and flying him out of Japan in a private jet. However, the escape involved a complex web of accomplices all over the world.</p>
   <p>In the latest development of the case, a Turkish court acquitted three people who were accused of assisting in Ghosn's escape. Mithat Ayan, Hakan Enson, and Ghosn's former driver, Omer Guner, were extradited from Romania in July 2020 and faced charges of illegal migrant smuggling and aiding and abetting a terrorist organization. They were acquitted of all charges in a retrial held in Istanbul.</p>
