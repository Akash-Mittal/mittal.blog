    <h2>The Story of ChatGPT</h2>
    <p>Imagine being in a remote area without internet access and needing to use a chatbot for assistance. This is a common scenario in many parts of the world, and it was the inspiration for ChatGPT, a new mobile app that can run AI chatbot natively on iPhones without requiring internet connectivity.</p>
    <p>ChatGPT was developed by a team of Indian engineers who wanted to make technology more accessible to people living in areas with poor internet connectivity. They believed that everyone should have access to the benefits of AI technology, regardless of their location or infrastructure limitations. With ChatGPT, users can interact with an AI chatbot for a variety of purposes, including customer service, personal assistance, and entertainment.</p>
