    <p>Imagine a world where robots can replace human interactions. It sounds like something out of a science fiction movie, but it's becoming a reality through Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI, or the ability of machines to mimic cognitive functions such as learning and problem solving, is now being used in various industries, from healthcare to finance, to make tasks faster and easier.</p>
    <p>However, the use of AI has raised ethical and moral issues. For instance, if robots can replace human interactions, what would happen to human jobs? In the healthcare industry, where AI is used to make diagnoses, what happens if the diagnosis is wrong?</p>
    <p>These are just some of the questions that have been raised because of the increasing use of AI. To address these concerns, the Group of Seven (G7) has made a call for the adoption of international technical standards for AI. Here's why this is crucial:</p>

    <p>The use of AI has increased immensely in recent years. In 2018, the global AI market was valued at $21.5 billion. By 2025, it's projected to reach $190 billion. As AI becomes more prevalent, it's important to have regulations in place to ensure its responsible use.</p>
    <p>One example of when AI went wrong is in the case of the self-driving Uber that killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona. The car's AI system failed to identify and avoid the pedestrian who was crossing the road. The incident brought to light the need for regulations in the development and deployment of self-driving cars.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, there are also positive examples of AI being used to improve society. In India, for example, AI is being used to improve crop yields and reduce crop damage. By analyzing data from sensors and satellites, farmers are able to make precise decisions on water and fertilizer usage, which has led to a 30% increase in crop yields.</p>

    <h2>The Need for International Technical Standards for AI</h2>
    <p>Currently, there are no international technical standards for AI. This means that there are no standardized guidelines and principles that developers and companies can follow to ensure the responsible use of AI. The lack of regulations has led to instances where AI has gone wrong, as seen in the case of the self-driving Uber.</p>
    <p>The G7's call for the adoption of international technical standards for AI is therefore crucial. These standards will ensure that AI is developed and used responsibly. They will cover various aspects of AI, from data protection to responsible design and deployment. With international technical standards in place, companies and developers will have a standard to follow, reducing the risk of AI errors and misuse.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>The use of AI has raised ethical and moral concerns, making the call for the adoption of international technical standards crucial.</li>
     <li>The lack of regulations has led to instances where AI has gone wrong, as seen in the case of the self-driving Uber.</li>
     <li>The adoption of international technical standards for AI will ensure the responsible development and deployment of AI, reducing the risk of errors and misuse.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The increasing use of AI has the potential to improve society, but only if it's done responsibly. With the adoption of international technical standards for AI, we can ensure that AI is developed and used in a way that benefits us all.</p>
