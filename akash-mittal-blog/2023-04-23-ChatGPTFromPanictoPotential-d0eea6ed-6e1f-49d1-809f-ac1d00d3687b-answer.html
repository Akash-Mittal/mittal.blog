   <p>Two years ago, ChatGPT was in the news for all the wrong reasons. The online chatbot, designed to assist students in their studies, was being used as a tool for cheating on tests and exams. Teachers and administrators were outraged, and there was even talk of banning ChatGPT from schools and universities altogether.</p>
   <p>However, something interesting began to happen. Some teachers and professors started to notice that their students were using ChatGPT not just to cheat, but also to learn. They saw the potential of the technology to assist in education in ways they had never predicted.</p>

    <li>A college math professor assigns ChatGPT as a supplemental resource for students who need extra help understanding concepts or working through problems.</li>
    <li>An adult learner uses ChatGPT to practice conversation skills in a new language, getting instant feedback and corrections from the chatbot.</li>
   </ul>
