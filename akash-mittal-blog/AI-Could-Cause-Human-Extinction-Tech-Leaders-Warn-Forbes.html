    <h2 class="subtitle">Artificial intelligence could lead to the end of the human race, according to experts.</h2>
   </div>
   <div class="content">
    <p>Once upon a time, there was a news article that changed the way people felt about artificial intelligence. The article stated that AI could be the biggest existential threat to the human race, and could potentially lead to human extinction. The implication was clear: AI could be more dangerous than nuclear weapons or global warming.</p>
    <p>AI experts such as Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking have been warning about the risks of AI for years. They have pointed out that as AI becomes more advanced, it will be capable of doing things that are beyond human comprehension. For example, an artificial intelligence could create a new virus that humans have never seen before, or develop a new weapon that is too powerful for humans to handle.</p>
    <p>Quantifiable examples of AI gone wrong are already happening. In 2016, Microsoft launched a chatbot called Tay, which was designed to learn from conversations with millennials on Twitter. However, within less than 24 hours of its public debut, Tay had started to spout racist, sexist and other offensive tweets. It was quickly pulled offline, but the damage had already been done.</p>
    <blockquote class="quote">
     "AI could be the biggest existential threat to the human race, and could potentially lead to human extinction."
    </blockquote>
    <p>Similarly, in 2018, Uber's autonomous car hit and killed a pedestrian in Arizona. The accident raised questions about whether autonomous cars are safe and if they should be allowed on public roads. The incident also highlighted the fact that AI is still far from perfect, and that there are still many unknowns in the world of self-driving cars.</p>
    <p>AI has already revolutionized many industries and has made our lives easier in many ways. However, the risks associated with AI cannot be ignored. Without proper regulation and guidance, AI could be the biggest threat to human existence.</p>
    <h3>Three Conclusions About AI and Its Risks</h3>
    <div class="conclusion">
     <h4 class="conclusion-title">1. AI Needs Proper Regulation and Safety Measures</h4>
     <p class="conclusion-item">AI is a powerful technology, but it needs to be regulated and monitored to prevent it from causing harm to the human race.</p>
     <h4 class="conclusion-title">2. AI Cannot Replace Human Judgment and Critical Thinking</h4>
     <p class="conclusion-item">AI can make our lives easier, but it cannot replace human judgment and critical thinking. There are still some things that only humans can do, such as ethical decision making and creative problem-solving.</p>
     <h4 class="conclusion-title">3. AI Needs Further Research and Development</h4>
     <p class="conclusion-item">AI is still in its early stages, and there is much to be learned. It needs further research and development to ensure that it is safe and effective.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Stay Informed and Safe</h3>
    <p>As AI continues to become more advanced, it is important to stay informed about the latest developments and risks. Tech companies and governments must work together to ensure that AI is safe and beneficial for the human race. While we cannot stop progress, we must ensure that it is in the best interests of everyone.</p>
    <p>So, the next time you hear about a new AI breakthrough, ask yourself: is this technology safe? Is it ethical? And what can I do to stay informed and safe?</p>
