    <h2>The Employee Evaluation that Changed Everything</h2>
    <p>It was a typical day at work for Sarah, a 30-something sales manager at a mid-sized marketing agency. But when she received a notification that her annual performance review was ready, she was not prepared for what was about to happen.</p>
    <p>Using an artificial intelligence software that had been recently implemented by the company to evaluate employee performance, Sarah's review showed that her sales numbers, though adequate, were not as impressive as those of her colleagues. What really shocked her, however, was that the algorithm had also assessed her attitude, behavior, and communication skills. The verdict was clear: she was not a "team player".</p>
    <p>Despite Sarah's protests, her boss informed her that the company was downsizing and that, as a result of the evaluation, she would have to be let go.</p>
    <p>Sarah's story is just one example of how AI is being used to make decisions about who stays and who goes in the workforce.</p>

    <h2>Real-Life Examples of AI-driven Layoffs</h2>
    <p>While Sarah's story is fictional, the reality is that more and more companies are turning to AI to augment or replace traditional HR practices in order to determine which employees are expendable.</p>
    <p>For example, IBM has used its own AI software to identify which employees are at the greatest risk of leaving the company. By analyzing various data sets, such as job tenure, pay raises, and job performance, the algorithm can predict when a worker might be considering quitting. IBM then uses this information to intervene and try to retain the employee.</p>
    <p>Conversely, Fidelity Investments has turned to an AI platform called "HERO" (an acronym for "holistic employee recognition and optimization") to guide company layoffs. The software analyzes employee data to determine which workers are the most valuable to the company. Those who are deemed dispensable, based on factors such as job performance, pay level, and skill set, are the ones who are let go.</p>

    <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>Employers are increasingly using AI to evaluate and make decisions about employees, including who to lay off.</li>
     <li>While companies argue that AI makes these decisions more objective and fair, critics express concern about potential biases in the algorithms and the lack of human oversight.</li>
     <li>In conclusion, while AI has the potential to dramatically transform the workforce, it is ultimately up to humans to determine how and when it is used.</li>
