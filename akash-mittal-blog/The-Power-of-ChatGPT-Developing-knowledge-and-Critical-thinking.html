    <h2>How ChatGPT Works</h2>
    <p>ChatGPT works by using a large amount of data to generate responses to user inquiries. It uses a technique called "deep learning," which involves analyzing patterns in data to make predictions and decisions.</p>
    <p>When you interact with ChatGPT, you can ask it questions or give it prompts related to a variety of topics. It will then use its AI capabilities to generate a response, which you can then analyze and use to expand your knowledge or further explore a particular topic.</p>
    <p>For example, if you were curious about the history of the Roman Empire, you could ask ChatGPT a question like "What were the major achievements of the Roman Empire?" It would then use its deep learning capabilities to generate a response that could include information on topics like politics, military conquests, and cultural achievements.</p>
