"2023-05-23 02:25 AM;","When Kate Middleton became a mother, she knew that raising her children in the public eye would come with unique challenges. One of these challenges was ensuring that her young children were well-behaved during important public events, such as the coronation of her husband's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II.
So, Kate came up with a savvy parenting trick to help keep her children well-behaved during the coronation. The trick was so effective that it quickly became a go-to strategy for other members of the royal family as well.
Kate's parenting trick involved giving her young children small, discreet snacks during long public events. By keeping her children's stomachs full and satisfied, she was able to prevent them from getting cranky or restless during the coronation and other important events.
But Kate didn't just give her children any old snacks. She carefully chose healthy, non-messy snacks that wouldn't stain their clothes or make a mess. Some of her go-to snacks included cereal bars, apple slices, and crackers.
Other members of the royal family quickly caught on to Kate's trick, and began incorporating small snacks into their own strategies for keeping young royals well-behaved during public events. Kate's parenting trick even became a media sensation, with parenting blogs and magazines hailing it as a genius strategy for keeping children happy and well-behaved during long outings.
