"2023-05-25 04:25 PM;","When my son was just a toddler, I used to read to him every night before bed. He loved it so much that I almost always had to read two or three books before he would even think of closing his eyes. It was a special time that we shared together, and it filled my heart with warmth every time he would snuggle up next to me and listen intently to each word.
As he's gotten older, however, I've noticed that he's less interested in having me read to him. While it makes me a little sad that our nightly reading routine doesn't bring him the same joy that it used to, I'm also proud that he's becoming an independent reader.
The truth is, as parents, we all want our children to be successful readers. Not only is it a critical life skill, but it's also a key component to academic success. However, it's not always easy to know how to encourage our children to become independent readers. That's why I've put together this guide, with tips and strategies for raising children who love to read.
One of the most important things you can do to encourage your child to become an independent reader is to make reading a daily habit. This means setting aside time every day for reading, whether it's reading together as a family, or having your child read independently. You can also create a reading nook or area in your home, with comfortable seating and good lighting, to make reading more enjoyable and inviting.
When my son was younger, we used to read together every night before bed. Now that he's older, we've changed things up a bit and he reads independently for at least 20 minutes every night before bed. We also make sure to take trips to the library on a regular basis so that he always has new and interesting books to read.
