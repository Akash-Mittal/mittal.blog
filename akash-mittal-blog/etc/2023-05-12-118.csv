"2023-05-22 06:25 AM;","Do you remember the last time you had to deal with a chatbot or virtual assistant that seemed clueless about your needs? Perhaps you felt frustrated or even angry, and wished you could just speak to a human being instead. Well, the good news is that with the advances in artificial intelligence, chatbots are becoming more sophisticated and responsive. The even better news is that you can learn how to prompt them like a pro, and improve your customer service interactions in the process.
Let me share a personal experience that illustrates the potential of chatbots and AI in customer service. A few weeks ago, I needed to book a flight for a business trip. As I was browsing the airline's website, I noticed a chatbot icon on the corner of the screen. I clicked on it, and a window opened with a friendly message: ""Hi, I'm Amy. How can I assist you?"".

She even asked if I needed any special assistance, such as a wheelchair or a specific meal, and offered to help with hotel reservations. I was impressed and grateful for her efficiency and empathy.
