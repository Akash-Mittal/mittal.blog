"2023-05-29 08:25 PM;","It was a beautiful day in May, and Jane, a promising senior at a well-respected university, was feeling the stress of impending finals. Her grades in her major were good, but she was struggling to keep up with the required general education courses. With the pressure mounting, she made a decision that would change her entire academic career: she paid a ghostwriter to write her final paper for her.
She was shocked at how easy it was to find someone online willing to do the work for her for a small fee. She was also thrilled with the results: she received an A+ on her paper and had more time to focus on her other classes. From that moment on, she never wrote another paper again.
Unfortunately, Jane's story is not unique. Contract cheating - the act of paying someone else to do your academic work - is on the rise, and it's leaving universities and educators scrambling for solutions. According to a recent study, contract cheating has increased by 15.7% since 2014. This is a significant problem for universities, as it undermines the integrity of academic degrees and makes it difficult to measure student learning.
ChatGPT is a new artificial intelligence tool that has the potential to help universities bust contract cheating. Here's how:
Universities can use ChatGPT as a preventative tool by integrating it into the assignment design process. For example, if a professor is designing a writing assignment, they could use ChatGPT to generate a list of potential topics and keywords. This would add an extra layer of security, as students would have a harder time finding pre-written papers that match the assignment. ChatGPT could also generate unique writing prompts that are tailored to a specific course, making it more difficult for ghostwriters to provide canned answers.
