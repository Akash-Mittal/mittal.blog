Curious about welding? Want to learn how to create metal sculptures or fix broken objects around the house? WSCC’s welding noncredit class offers an introduction to the basics of welding, including safety, equipment use, and techniques for different types of welding.
In just four classes, students will gain hands-on experience in welding and can create projects ranging from a simple metal cube to a metal sculpture.
