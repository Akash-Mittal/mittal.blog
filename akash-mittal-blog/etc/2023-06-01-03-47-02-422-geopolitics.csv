But with the increasing interconnectedness of nations, it has become even more important. In this article, we will look at how Australia and New Zealand are strengthening their economic ties with China and India.
One example of a successful partnership between New Zealand and China is in the export of kiwi fruits. New Zealand has been exporting kiwi fruits to China for over a decade. In 2019, New Zealand exported 59 million trays of kiwi fruits to China, worth NZD 1.18 billion. This was up from 19 million trays in 2010.
The Chinese market is particularly important for New Zealand's kiwi fruit exports, as it is the largest market for kiwi fruits in the world. This success can be attributed to the free trade agreement between New Zealand and China, which was signed in 2008. This agreement has helped to reduce tariffs on New Zealand kiwi fruits, making them more affordable for Chinese consumers.
In recent years, China's economic ties with India have also been growing. According to the Ministry of Commerce of China, bilateral trade between China and India exceeded USD 100 billion in 2018. This is a significant increase from the USD 73.9 billion in 2017. China is now India's largest trading partner, while India is China's 11th largest trading partner.
The two countries have been working together to increase bilateral trade even further. In 2019, the two countries held their first high-level mechanism to discuss trade and investment cooperation. They also agreed to set up a new mechanism to discuss trade issues and to establish a high-level economic and trade dialogue. India and China are also exploring the possibility of starting direct flights between their two countries to boost tourism.

Once upon a time, in a small village at the foothills of the Himalayas, there lived two neighbors, India and China. They were once friends, sharing food and culture, until one day, they had a misunderstanding about a piece of land that they both claimed as their own. The dispute escalated and turned into a conflict, with both sides deploying their troops at the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The tension grew, and the world watched with apprehension, fearing a full-scale war. However, after several rounds of talks, India and China agreed to hold military talks at LAC soon.
The India China border dispute has been ongoing for several decades now, with frequent skirmishes and transgressions. The LAC, which is the de facto border between India and China, has been a source of tension for both countries. The recent clash in Galwan Valley, where 20 Indian soldiers were martyred, and an unknown number of Chinese soldiers were killed, was a significant blow to the bilateral relationship. However, both nations realize the importance of maintaining peace and stability along the border, which is why they agreed to hold military talks at LAC soon.
The above examples show how closely intertwined the economies of India and China are and the importance of maintaining peace along the border. The talks at LAC are a step towards finding a peaceful resolution to the border dispute.
The India China border dispute is a complex issue that requires a multi-pronged approach to resolve. The talks at LAC are a positive step towards finding a peaceful solution to the conflict. The following are the three key takeaways from the military talks:

The data released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation on Tuesday showed that growth was driven by the manufacturing, construction and financial sectors, as well as by a surge in consumer spending.
India's GDP was hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic last year, contracting by a record 7.7% in the fiscal year 2020-21. The lockdowns and restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the virus severely disrupted economic activity and caused job losses and hardship for millions of people.
However, as the vaccination drive picked up pace and the government eased restrictions, economic activity started to recover. The manufacturing sector, which had been severely affected by the pandemic, resumed operations and started to produce goods for both domestic and export markets. The construction sector, which had been adversely affected by the halt in construction activities, also saw a rebound in demand as people started to invest in housing and infrastructure. The financial sector, too, showed signs of recovery as credit growth and capital inflows increased.
Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of India's GDP, also picked up as people started to spend on goods and services that they had put off during the pandemic. The festive season and the lifting of restrictions on travel and leisure activities further boosted consumer confidence and spending.
The government's stimulus measures, including tax cuts and subsidies, also played a role in supporting the recovery. The Reserve Bank of India's accommodative monetary policy, which kept interest rates low and provided liquidity to banks, also helped to ease financial conditions and support lending.

The two nations are looking to expand their partnership in a range of areas, including joint training exercises, exchange of information and technology, and increased procurement of defence equipment.
India and Cambodia have a rich history of cultural and economic ties dating back to ancient times. The two nations have long been connected through trade and commerce, with Indian traders visiting Cambodia as early as the 1st century AD. Today, India is one of the largest investors in Cambodia, with investments of over $1 billion in sectors such as agriculture, infrastructure, and manufacturing.
Now, India and Cambodia are set to take their partnership to the next level by deepening their defence trade ties. India has already been providing training and support to the Cambodian military, and the two nations are now exploring ways to enhance their cooperation in a range of areas, including joint training exercises, exchange of information and technology, and increased procurement of defence equipment.
The potential benefits of deepening India-Cambodia defence trade ties are significant. For example, India is one of the world's leading manufacturers of defence equipment, including aircraft, tanks, and missiles. By increasing its procurement of Indian-made defence equipment, Cambodia can strengthen its military capabilities and enhance its ability to defend its territorial sovereignty.
India, on the other hand, can benefit from Cambodia's strategic location at the crossroads of the Indo-Pacific region. With its deep-water ports and access to key shipping lanes, Cambodia can serve as a hub for India's maritime trade and logistics in the region.

The Chinese market is the largest electric vehicle market in the world, so it made perfect sense for Tesla to set up shop in the country. However, what many people do not know is that there were numerous challenges that Tesla faced when it first started operating in China.
After the factory's opening, the US-China trade war escalated and tensions were high between the two countries. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, was no stranger to this situation. In fact, he was in the middle of it all. He had to navigate the political situation, while trying to establish his new factory in a foreign country.
Musk realized that the situation was not ideal and he knew that something needed to be done to improve the US-China relationship. He was determined to make things better not just for Tesla, but for both countries. He urged for cooperation and collaboration between the two superpowers and made it clear that he believed in the potential of what both countries could accomplish together.
Musk's call for better Sino-US ties was not just a matter of political rhetoric. It had quantifiable benefits as well.
Since Tesla's China factory opened, the company's sales have skyrocketed. In the first half of 2021, Tesla sold 139,300 vehicles in China, a 129% increase from the same period last year. Tesla's popularity in China is evident from the fact that the country accounts for almost a third of its global sales.

The latest casualty of this rift is the communication channels between the nations.
Both India and China have frozen out journalists from reporting on the events that have transpired after the Galwan clash. This has affected their ability to report on the ground, and has left many questions unanswered.
The reasons behind this diplomatic freeze are manifold. But what is clear is that both nations suffer from a lack of transparency and trust, both in their communication with each other and with the rest of the world.
The following examples illustrate just how much the freeze out of journalists has affected the ability of media to report on this ongoing conflict:
The freeze out of journalists matters because it reduces transparency in a conflict that is already shrouded in secrecy. Without an independent and reliable source of information, it is difficult to separate fact from propaganda and understand what is really going on.
