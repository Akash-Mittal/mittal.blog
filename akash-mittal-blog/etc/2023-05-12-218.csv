"2023-05-30 02:25 PM;","Imagine you are watching a movie. Suddenly, the plot takes an unexpected twist, leaving you in awe. You try to figure out how the writers came up with such a brilliant idea, but then you realize it was all thanks to Artificial Intelligence (AI).
AI has become a valuable tool for filmmakers and TV producers to enhance their storytelling, production efficiency, and cost savings. However, not everyone is happy with AI's extensive usage. The Writer's Strike that started on November 4th, 2021, is an indication of this unhappiness. They are trying to push their demands for AI-free productions.
AI is revolutionizing the entertainment industry, and here are some real examples:
The Writer's Strike is not a new phenomenon. In 2007, the Writer's Guild of America went on strike for 100 days, fighting for better wages and residuals for their work when it was streamed or downloaded online.
However, this time around, they are protesting AI's incorporation into every aspect of the entertainment production process. Writers fear that AI poses a great threat to the quality of storytelling and challenges their creative rights. Furthermore, AI's predictive capabilities might lead to the development of repetitive, trope-driven, and uninventive productions designed solely to meet specific demographic demands.
