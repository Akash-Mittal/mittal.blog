2023-05-11 11:43 PM;,"When I had my first child, returning to work seemed almost impossible. I struggled with the decision to leave my baby in someone else's care while I worked to provide for our family. But, as a working mother, I soon discovered that there were ways that architecture and parenting practices could help aid my return to work and make the transition smoother for both me and my baby.
One way that architecture can help parents return to work is by designing for parenthood. This means creating spaces that are both functional and comfortable for parents and children. For example, workplaces could provide designated lactation rooms that are convenient and private for breastfeeding mothers. Or, coworking spaces could offer on-site child care services with trained professionals. This would not only benefit the parents but, it would also create an inclusive and family-friendly environment for all employees.
Architecture is not the only solution. Balancing work and parenting requires strategy and practice. One way to balance work and parenting is by setting boundaries. Establishing specific work hours and childcare hours, free from interruptions and distractions, can make your time more productive and focused. Additionally, utilizing technologies like video conferencing, productivity apps, and online calendars can help to streamline your work and home life.
Finally, the support system around you can make all the difference. Having a reliable network of family, friends, or coworkers you can depend on can help with the transition back to work. Seeking advice from other working parents and connecting with organizations that address work and family issues, can offer useful insight and community. It's also important to have the support of your workplace. An understanding, flexible, and accommodating employer can make the return to work easier for parents and less stressful.
When I returned to work after having my second child, I was fortunate enough to work for an employer who valued their employees' family lives. My employer offered flexible work schedules, on-site lactation rooms, and a supportive community of working parents, which made a huge difference in my return to work. I was able to balance my work and parenting life and feel supported in both.

2023-05-12 03:43 AM;,"""The problem with weapons is that they come with instructions."" - Abby Huntsman
Imagine a world where countries stop selling weapons to oppressive regimes, where guns don't end up in the hands of terrorists, and where civilians are not caught in the crossfire of armed conflicts. The Arms Trade Treaty, adopted by the United Nations in 2013, aims to make this vision a reality.
The Arms Trade Treaty aims to regulate international trade in conventional weapons and prevent their diversion to illicit or undesirable recipients. This includes small arms and light weapons - like handguns, rifles, and machine guns - as well as tanks, combat aircraft, and warships. By creating a set of international standards for authorizing weapons transfers and monitoring the end use of weapons, the Arms Trade Treaty seeks to prevent human rights abuses and promote global security.

However, with the ever-increasing penetration of AI and machine learning in various industries, things are changing, and so is SEO. AI has the ability to learn from vast amounts of data, which means it can quickly adapt and improve search algorithms, leading to an entirely new approach to SEO.
One major impact of AI on SEO is the increasing use of voice search. According to Google, 20% of searches on any mobile device are conducted with voice commands. As AI assistants like Siri and Alexa become more ubiquitous, this figure is expected to rise even more. This means that SEO professionals need to optimize their content to include conversational language and natural sentence structures.
Furthermore, AI-based algorithms have become smarter and more discerning in interpreting user intent. Google's RankBrain algorithm is one such example that can now analyze search queries' context and semantic meaning to produce more accurate and relevant results.

2023-05-12 07:43 PM;,"It's not uncommon for celebrities to come under fire from internet trolls, but when the troll has lost an infant and the celebrity responds by getting petty, it becomes a different story. Cardi B, the Grammy Award-winning rapper, found herself in hot water after she got into a heated exchange with an Instagram user who lost her infant son. In this article, we'll explore the incident in detail and speak with the lead attorney to discuss the legal implications of the case.
It all started with a meme that was posted on Instagram, which featured a photo of Cardi B and her husband, Offset, with their infant daughter Kulture. The caption read, ""I hope Offset cheating on you in peace."" The post quickly went viral, and one user in particular responded with a comment that read, ""Why her baby don't look like her...smh."" The user, whose Instagram handle was @Starmarieeee, had recently lost her infant son, and the comment struck a nerve. Cardi B responded by getting petty, going back and forth with @Starmarieeee, and bringing up the fact that the user had lost her infant son.
Cardi B's response caused a firestorm on social media, and the rapper soon found herself facing backlash from fans and critics alike. As the story continued to gain traction, the lead attorney was contacted for his expert opinion on the legal implications of the incident.
According to the lead attorney, the incident raises several important legal questions, including:
The lead attorney stated that while Cardi B's response was certainly insensitive, it is unlikely that she could be held liable for her actions. However, he cautioned that the situation could have a negative impact on Cardi B's public image, with potential consequences ranging from lost endorsements to decreased record sales.

Youâre sleep-deprived and stressed out, and the thought of facing another day of work is enough to make you call in sick. Unfortunately, this is a reality for too many workers, and itâs taking a toll on their mental health.
According to the World Health Organization, depression and anxiety cost the global economy $1 trillion a year. These conditions affect 1 in 4 people, making them the leading cause of disability worldwide. However, workplaces can play a major role in promoting mental health and preventing burnout. Here are some tips for creating a safe space that supports employeesâ mental health.
Employees spend most of their waking hours at work, which means their work environment can have a big impact on their mental health.

2023-05-13 03:43 AM;,"It was a hot summer day and Mary decided to crank up the air conditioner. She knew that it would cause her energy bill to go up, but she just couldn't take the heat. As the month went on, the temperature kept rising and so did her energy bill. In the end, she was stuck with a bill that was over double her usual amount. This got her thinking, does the heat affect her finances in more ways than she realized?
Mary's experience is not unique. During the summer months, many people turn up the air conditioning to stay cool. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), cooling costs account for about 6% of the average household's energy expenses.
In areas with extreme heat, such as the southern and western United States, those costs can be even higher. The EIA reports that households in these regions can spend up to 20% of their energy budget on cooling.
To put that in tangible terms, let's consider a family with a monthly energy bill of $200. During the summer months, their cooling costs might account for $12 of that bill. However, if temperatures soar and they need to use more energy to stay cool, that cost could easily double to $24 or more.
But cooling costs are not the only way that heat can affect finances. When the temperatures rise, people tend to spend more on things like ice cream, cold drinks, and outdoor activities.

From privacy issues to bias in decision making, there are a number of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns that investors need to be aware of when investing in AI-powered companies.
In March 2016, Microsoft introduced Tay, a Twitter chatbot designed to learn from its conversations with users and become more intelligent over time. However, within 24 hours, Tay had started responding to tweets with offensive and racist language, as a result of being taught by some users to become a hate-filled bot.
While Microsoft swiftly shut down the project and issued an apology, it underscored the potential dangers of AI and the importance of proper governance to prevent such unintended consequences.

The European Parliament passed these measures in response to concerns from consumers and consumer protection groups about the impact of chatbots and other AI systems on consumer privacy and autonomy. The measure has been praised by many as a significant step forward in protecting consumers from the unintended consequences of AI.
While it's difficult to quantify the exact impact that chatbots and other forms of AI are having on consumers, some studies and individual experiences suggest that there is a need for greater regulation. For example:
These examples suggest that there is a real need for regulation of chatbots and other AI systems that interact with consumers, both to protect consumers from deceptive or overly aggressive chatbots, and to ensure that consumers are able to maintain their privacy and autonomy when interacting with technology.

2023-05-13 03:43 PM;,"There is a common phrase that many parents say to their children when they criticize their parenting styles. It goes something like, ""I raised you this way, and you turned out just fine."" While this might be true in some cases, it doesn't necessarily mean that the parenting style was the best or most effective one out there.
As generations change, so too do parenting styles. What worked for one generation might not work for the next. For example, many Baby Boomers grew up with strict, authoritarian parents who believed in corporal punishment. However, this style of parenting was not as common for their children, the Gen Xers, and is even less common for their grandchildren, the Millennials.
So why do parenting styles change? Part of the reason has to do with societal and cultural changes over time. As we become more aware of the impact of child development and mental health, we realize that certain styles of parenting can be harmful and counterproductive. Additionally, each generation brings its own set of values and beliefs to the table, which can affect how they approach parenting.

WebGPU is a new API that allows web developers to access the full power of modern graphics processors (GPUs). This means that web browsers can now render complex 3D graphics in real time, and with high levels of detail and interactivity.
Traditionally, web graphics have been rendered using WebGL, a low-level API that is limited in its capabilities. WebGL was designed around the concept of drawing triangles in 3D space, and while it has been used to create some impressive graphics and games, it has its limitations.
WebGPU, on the other hand, was designed from the ground up for modern GPUs, and takes full advantage of the latest hardware and software technologies. It offers a much higher level of abstraction than WebGL, making it easier for developers to create complex graphics and animations.
The potential of WebGPU is huge. It opens up new possibilities for web developers to create immersive web experiences, from virtual reality (VR) environments to interactive 3D models. And because it's based on web standards, these experiences can be accessed from any device with a modern web browser, without the need for additional plugins or software.

The inspiration behind Google's Smart Compose technology came from the need for quicker and more efficient email responses. According to the tech giant, the average person writes 40 emails a day on average. Most of these emails are typically long-form and repetitive responses, such as scheduling appointments or answering routine queries. The conventional way of writing these emails can be time-consuming and arduous. In light of this, Google developed the AI-powered 'Smart Compose' feature to simplify the process of email writing.
The technology works by analyzing the content of your email and offering suggestions for your next sentence based on your previous writing style. Once you start typing in Gmail, Smart Compose will suggest possible sentences or key phrases that you can use to complete your message. All you need to do is press the 'tab' key to accept the suggestion.
Smart Compose incorporates natural language processing (NLP) technology to understand the intention behind the message and provide contextually relevant suggestions. The AI algorithms are designed to continuously learn from your writing patterns and improve its accuracy over time.
Google has provided several examples of Smart Compose's versatility in writing effective emails. In one instance, an employee was able to write an email ten times faster with the feature, while another study revealed that over 50% of relevant suggestions (given by Smart Compose) were accepted by Gmail users.

2023-05-15 11:43 AM;,"Do you remember the last time you had to deal with a chatbot or virtual assistant that seemed clueless about your needs? Perhaps you felt frustrated or even angry, and wished you could just speak to a human being instead. Well, the good news is that with the advances in artificial intelligence, chatbots are becoming more sophisticated and responsive. The even better news is that you can learn how to prompt them like a pro, and improve your customer service interactions in the process.
Let me share a personal experience that illustrates the potential of chatbots and AI in customer service. A few weeks ago, I needed to book a flight for a business trip. As I was browsing the airline's website, I noticed a chatbot icon on the corner of the screen. I clicked on it, and a window opened with a friendly message: ""Hi, I'm Amy. How can I assist you?"". I typed my request: ""I need to fly from New York to London on June 15th, returning on June 22nd. What are my options?"". To my surprise, Amy replied within seconds, with a list of flights that matched my criteria, along with the prices and departure times. She even asked if I needed any special assistance, such as a wheelchair or a specific meal, and offered to help with hotel reservations. I was impressed and grateful for her efficiency and empathy. I thanked her and booked the flight that suited me best. As I closed the chat window, I wondered how Amy had managed to understand my request so accurately and respond so promptly. Had she been a real person, or a computer program? What other tasks could she perform? How could I learn to prompt her even better?
If you're curious about the answers to those questions, or if you simply want to excel in your chatbot interactions, read on. In the following sections, I'll provide you with some practical tips, personal anecdotes and case studies that can help you prompt ChatGPT like a pro.
One of the most common mistakes people make when talking to chatbots is assuming that they understand synonyms, typos, or incomplete sentences. While some chatbots have natural language processing capabilities that allow them to guess the intent behind your words, most rely on pre-defined scripts or keywords to trigger their responses. Therefore, it's important to be clear and specific in your requests, and to avoid using ambiguous or colloquial expressions.
For example, instead of saying ""I want to cancel my order"", which could trigger a series of questions about which order, when, and why, it's better to say ""I want to cancel my order #12345 that I placed on May 10th, because I changed my mind"". This way, the chatbot can immediately recognize the order number, the date, and the reason for cancellation, and provide you with a relevant response, such as ""Sure, I've canceled your order #12345 and refunded your payment. Is there anything else I can assist you with?"".

2023-05-15 03:43 PM;,"Jenna Bush Hager, daughter of former President George W. Bush and former First Lady Laura Bush, faced many challenges raising her three children. She often turned to her mom for advice on how to be a better parent. In a recent interview, she shared the best parenting lessons she has learned from her mom.
One of Laura's best parenting lessons is to always be present and engaged with your children. She would frequently put aside her own plans and activities to spend time with her daughters, whether it was playing a game, reading a book, or simply listening to them talk about their day. This made her daughters feel loved and valued, and helped to build strong relationships.
Another lesson from Laura is to be consistent with discipline. She would set clear expectations for her daughters and follow through with consequences when those expectations were not met. This helped her daughters learn to be responsible and accountable for their actions.
A final lesson from Laura is to teach your children to be kind and compassionate. She modeled this behavior by volunteering and giving back to her community, and encouraged her daughters to do the same.

2023-05-15 07:43 PM;,"When Kate Middleton became a mother, she knew that raising her children in the public eye would come with unique challenges. One of these challenges was ensuring that her young children were well-behaved during important public events, such as the coronation of her husband's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II.
So, Kate came up with a savvy parenting trick to help keep her children well-behaved during the coronation. The trick was so effective that it quickly became a go-to strategy for other members of the royal family as well.
Kate's parenting trick involved giving her young children small, discreet snacks during long public events. By keeping her children's stomachs full and satisfied, she was able to prevent them from getting cranky or restless during the coronation and other important events.
But Kate didn't just give her children any old snacks. She carefully chose healthy, non-messy snacks that wouldn't stain their clothes or make a mess. Some of her go-to snacks included cereal bars, apple slices, and crackers.
Other members of the royal family quickly caught on to Kate's trick, and began incorporating small snacks into their own strategies for keeping young royals well-behaved during public events. Kate's parenting trick even became a media sensation, with parenting blogs and magazines hailing it as a genius strategy for keeping children happy and well-behaved during long outings.

2023-05-16 07:43 AM;,"Web 3.0, also known as the decentralized web or the semantic web, is the next phase of the internet. It involves a shift towards a more open and decentralized internet, where users have more control over their data and interactions. For entrepreneurs, this has significant implications for how they do business and interact with their audiences.
One of the key aspects of Web 3.0 is decentralization. Instead of relying on centralized platforms like Facebook or Google, web 3.0 technologies like blockchain and peer-to-peer networks allow for decentralized, trustless interactions between users.
For entrepreneurs, this means they can build applications and services that don't rely on centralized intermediaries. For example, a social media platform built on a decentralized network could give users more control over their data and interactions, while also enabling them to earn rewards for contributing to the network.
Decentralization also has implications for fundraising. Through initial coin offerings (ICOs) or token sales, entrepreneurs can raise funds for their projects directly from the community. This is a departure from traditional funding models, which often involve pitching to venture capitalists or angel investors.
Another key aspect of Web 3.0 is interoperability. This means different applications and services can communicate and interact with each other, even if they're built on different platforms or networks.

2023-05-16 11:43 AM;,"Dr. John is a medical professional who has been in the industry for over 15 years. He loves his job and is committed to providing the best possible care for all of his patients. However, after years of practice, he started to feel burdened by the amount of time he spent documenting patient records. This left him with little time to focus on his patients and provide them with the quality care they deserve.
It wasn't until Dr. John discovered the latest tool from ChatGPT that he was able to streamline his documentation process and free up more time to focus on his patients.
According to a study by the American Medical Association, doctors spend, on average, two hours of their day on documentation tasks. The new ChatGPT tool has been able to reduce this time by up to 50%.
Furthermore, patients have reported a higher satisfaction rate after interacting with doctors who use the new ChatGPT tool. The system helps doctors stay focused and engaged with their patients during appointments rather than looking at their computer screens.
Dr. John isn't the only medical professional who has found success with ChatGPT. Dr. Jane, a general practitioner in a busy urban clinic, was able to see a significant reduction in her stress levels after using the new tool. She said, ""I used to dread the paperwork that came with my job, but ChatGPT has made it so much easier. Now I can focus on my patients without feeling overwhelmed.""

2023-05-16 03:43 PM;,"When I became a parent for the first time, I was excited and scared. Excited to meet my little bundle of joy and see what he or she would become, but also scared of the responsibility that comes with being a parent. It was a feeling that I had never experienced before - a mix of anticipation and anxiety that stayed with me throughout the entire pregnancy.
Then the day came. My wife went into labor, and we rushed to the hospital. I remember feeling so overwhelmed and helpless watching my wife go through the pains of childbirth. But when my baby was finally born, I was filled with the most incredible sense of joy and love that I had ever experienced. From that moment on, I knew that being a parent was going to be the most rewarding and challenging thing that I would ever do.
Robert De Niro, the famous actor and producer, is a father of seven children. He has said that parenting is both exciting and scary. On one hand, he loves watching his children grow and develop into unique individuals. On the other hand, he worries about their safety and well-being, especially given his fame and the dangers that come with it. De Niro says that being a parent has taught him how to be patient, how to listen, and how to be less self-centered.
When my oldest child started kindergarten, I was a nervous wreck. I was worried about how he would handle being away from home for so long, whether he would make friends, whether he was eating enough at lunch. I remember hovering around him in the schoolyard, trying to make sure that he felt safe and secure.
But over time, I learned to trust in my son's ability to handle new situations and to adjust to change. I also learned to give him space to grow and make mistakes. It was a lesson that I have carried with me throughout my parenting journey.

2023-05-16 07:43 PM;,"It was a beautiful day in the small town of Springdale. However, the peace and tranquility of the town were shattered when a man shot three people, killing one, in a dispute over four.
According to witnesses, the incident happened at a local diner, where two groups of people got into an argument over seating arrangements. The argument quickly turned into a physical confrontation, and the shooter, who was part of one of the groups, pulled out a gun and started firing indiscriminately.
This tragic incident is a clear example of how a trivial dispute over something as simple as seating arrangements can lead to violence and death. It is important to learn from such incidents and take steps to prevent them from happening in the future.
In conclusion, the shooting incident in Springdale is a tragic reminder of the destructive power of gun violence and the importance of taking action to prevent it. Let us work together to build a safer and more peaceful society for all.

I had the pleasure of sitting down with the legend himself to discuss his experiences with parenthood and the ups and downs that come with it. De Niro shared that even with all the fame and fortune, being a parent is one of the greatest challenges heâs ever faced.
De Niro recalled an event that happened when he was raising his second child, Elliot, with his wife at the time, Diahnne Abbott.
âOne of the most memorable experiences Iâve had as a father was when Elliot was born. I remember holding him in my arms for the first time and feeling a sense of responsibility that Iâd never felt before,â he recounted. âThat was when I realized that being a parent is not something to be taken lightly.â
De Niro acknowledges that everyoneâs parenting experience is different, but he shares some quantifiable examples of the challenges he and his family have faced over the years.

De Niro panicked and chased after him. Just as he reached his son, the child stumbled and almost fell into the pond. De Niro was able to catch him just in time, but the experience left him shaken. This incident made him realise that being a parent is not easy, but it is also one of the most rewarding experiences of his life.
Robert De Niro has seven children, and he finds that each one is unique and brings something special to his life. For him, the exciting part of parenting is watching his children develop into independent and capable individuals. He enjoys seeing them achieve their goals and succeed in their chosen career paths. He is proud of his children and the people they have become.
De Niro also considers it exciting to be able to share experiences with his children and to see the world through their eyes. He loves to travel with them and expose them to different cultures and ways of life. He believes that these experiences help his children become well-rounded individuals with a broader perspective on life.
Finally, De Niro is also excited about the opportunity to pass on his values and beliefs to his children. He believes that parenting is about setting a good example and teaching his children to be kind, compassionate and empathetic. He takes great pride in the fact that his children have a strong moral compass and are good citizens of the world.
These are just a few examples of the exciting aspects of parenting. There are many others, and each parent will find their own unique joys in the experience.

Iâd pack my sleeping bag and head to my friendâs house, where weâd stay up late, talk about boys, and then fall asleep in a fort made of blankets. But now that Iâm a parent, I dread sleepovers. I know how much disruption they cause to our family life, but Iâm not sure I can avoid them altogether.

She vowed never to let it happen again.

Imagine it's the early 1900s and you're riding in a horse carriage down a dirt road. Suddenly, you see a car zoom past you, making a loud noise and emitting a foul smell. You shake your head and scoff at the thought of this new technology ever replacing the majestic animal pulling your carriage.
Fast forward to present day, and we're on the cusp of a similar transition, but this time it's not cars replacing horses â it's AI replacing humans.
AI is no longer a pie-in-the-sky concept relegated to sci-fi movies and university research labs. It's here, and it's transforming the way we live and work. AI-first companies, such as Google and Facebook, are leading the charge by incorporating machine learning and natural language processing into their products.
Even traditional industries, such as healthcare, finance, and transportation, are embracing AI in order to increase efficiency and reduce costs. For example, IBM Watson is being used to assist doctors in diagnosing patients, while Uber is investing heavily in self-driving cars to replace human drivers.

2023-05-17 11:43 PM;,"As a parent, it can be tough to watch your child grow up and start navigating the world on their own. For me, one of the biggest challenges has been watching my daughter date. Don't get me wrong, I want her to be happy and find love, but seeing her face the same challenges and heartbreaks that I did is hard. In this article, I'll share some of my insights on the challenges of parenting, especially when it comes to my daughter's dating habits.
One of the most important things you can do as a parent is to set clear boundaries and expectations from the start. This means talking to your child about what you expect from their behavior and how they should treat others in relationships. It also means setting limits on things like curfew and access to technology. By establishing these guidelines early on, you can help your child navigate the world of dating with more confidence and support.
For me, this has meant having some tough conversations with my daughter. We've talked about what she wants in a relationship, what her values are, and how she can recognize unhealthy behaviors. We've also talked about things like sex and contraception, and I've encouraged her to make responsible choices. By being open and honest about these topics, I hope to give my daughter the tools she needs to make good decisions.
It can be tempting as a parent to let your child handle everything on their own, especially as they get older. But I believe it's important to stay involved in your child's life, even as they start to date. This might mean asking questions about who they're seeing and what they're doing, or it might mean offering words of support and encouragement. Whatever it looks like for you, find ways to stay connected to your child and their experiences.
For me, this has meant showing up for my daughter in small but meaningful ways. I've gone to her school dances, helped her pick out outfits for dates, and even given some dating advice (although I know she doesn't always want to hear it). I try to strike a balance between letting her make her own decisions and being there for her when she needs me. By staying involved, I hope to show my daughter that I care and that she can come to me with anything.

When it comes to pregnancy and parenting, there are some mysteries that are hard to explain. From strange cravings to unexplainable phenomena, these experiences can leave new parents feeling bewildered and confused. In this article, we'll explore some of the most unexplainable mysteries of pregnancy and parenting, and attempt to shed some light on these strange phenomena.
One of the strangest mysteries of pregnancy is the phenomenon of cravings. While it's normal to experience some cravings during pregnancy, some pregnant women report an intense desire for foods that they've never liked before, or even foods that are considered inedible or dangerous.
Take the case of Maria, a pregnant woman who reported to her doctor that she was experiencing a strong craving for dirt. Yes, you heard that right â dirt. After some investigation, the doctor discovered that Maria was suffering from a condition known as geophagia, which is a form of pica, a disorder that involves eating non-food items.
While the exact cause of cravings during pregnancy is unknown, some theories suggest that hormonal changes, nutritional deficiencies, or cultural influences may play a role. Whatever the cause, it's important for pregnant women to be mindful of their cravings and to consult with their healthcare provider if they experience any unusual or intense cravings.

Suddenly, we had access to a world of information, entertainment, and communication that we had never imagined. But now, decades later, the internet has become a mixed bag. While it still offers all of those things, it has also become a place where our personal information is constantly at risk, and where centralized power structures dictate what we can and can't see.
But there's a new technology on the horizon that promises to change everything: Web3.
Web3 is a decentralized internet that puts individuals back in control of their online experience. Instead of relying on a few large corporations to provide us with access to the internet, we'll be able to connect directly to one another, peer-to-peer.
At the heart of Web3 is blockchain technology. This technology allows for secure, transparent, and immutable transactions that can be used to power everything from online marketplaces to social media networks.
The current internet is centralized, which means that a few large corporations control access to the internet. This centralized structure has led to a number of problems, including:

It is an AI-powered chatbot that can engage in human-like conversations with users. However, Google's ChatGPT has a fierce rival in the form of Bard, an AI-powered chatbot developed by a small startup in Hong Kong. Bard had opened up to 180 countries, but then suddenly disappeared without a trace.
The mystery of Bard's disappearance has left the tech world baffled. Some believe that the founders of Bard may have sold their technology to a larger tech giant, while others think that Bard may have fallen victim to a cyber-attack. However, no concrete evidence has been found to support either theory.
As the mystery of Bard's disappearance deepens, tech enthusiasts around the world continue to speculate about its fate. Will Bard ever be found, or will it remain forever lost in the annals of technological history?
While the mystery of Bard's disappearance is yet to be solved, there are some quantifiable examples that attest to the popularity of AI-powered chatbots. According to a survey by Business Insider, 80% of businesses plan to have chatbots by 2020, up from just 10% in 2016. Additionally, AI-powered chatbots are expected to save businesses $8 billion per year by 2022.
Personal anecdotes also reveal the potential of AI-powered chatbots. One such example is from a major airline that replaced its traditional customer service with an AI-powered chatbot. The chatbot was able to answer 97% of all inquiries, resulting in a significant reduction in wait time for customers and reduced operating costs for the airline.

When Keeley first joined the team as Roy's girlfriend, it seemed like she was just there to provide some romantic tension. However, as the show has progressed, Keeley has become a beloved character in her own right. She's smart, funny, and fiercely independent. When Jamie is injured and has to take a step back from the team, Keeley is there to help him through it. Throughout Season 2, we see their relationship develop. They start out as friends, but as they spend more time together, it becomes clear that there's something more there.
Some fans are skeptical of this pairing, pointing out that Jamie has been a bit of a jerk in the past. But it's important to remember that characters can grow and change. Jamie has gone through a lot of personal growth over the course of the show, and it's possible that Keeley has had a positive influence on him.
One of the biggest indicators that Keeley and Jamie could end up together is the chemistry between the actors. Juno Temple and Phil Dunster have incredible chemistry onscreen, and their scenes together are some of the most memorable of the entire series. You can't fake that kind of connection, and it's clear that the two actors have a great rapport.
Keeley and Jamie also have a lot in common. They're both passionate about soccer, and they both have a strong sense of loyalty to their friends and loved ones. They also have a great sense of humor and can make each other laugh. These shared interests and values are the foundation of any successful relationship.
