"2023-05-28 04:25 PM;","Jenna, the marketing head of a growing startup, wanted to improve her team's productivity and communication. She started evaluating various chatbot platforms and finally decided on ChatGPT. Jenna was excited to see the improvements in her team's workflow - faster responses, increased productivity, and better collaboration.
However, the use of ChatGPT started affecting productivity negatively. Employees became addicted to the conversational model and started treating it like a game, communicating excessively, and wasting time. Jenna's team was experiencing a real-time communication overload and couldn't distinguish important conversations from trivial ones.
This story depicts how the implementation of a new communication tool can have both positive and negative impacts on the workforce, and it's essential to have a policy in place that outlines its use in the workplace.
According to a survey conducted by TalentLyft, 57% of HR professionals believe that communication is the most significant problem in a company. The same survey found that 28% of employees prefer chatbots as their primary channel for communication.
As per Statista, 15.4 billion messages were sent globally in 2020, and the number is expected to exceed 17.7 billion by 2024. This data, in conjunction with the TalentLyft survey, indicates the growing importance of chatbots in the workplace and the need for policies and regulations to ensure their proper and productive use.
