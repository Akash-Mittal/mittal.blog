Once upon a time, Google had access to some of the most advanced AI technologies in the world. Their engineers were pioneers in fields like machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning, and they worked tirelessly to develop cutting-edge algorithms and neural networks. However, despite their success, they realized that they couldn't keep these technologies locked up in a lab forever. They needed to share their knowledge with the world, to create a community of experts, and to drive innovation and progress.
