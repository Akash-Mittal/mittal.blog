"2023-06-01 12:25 AM;","Years of preparation and hard work go into preparing for the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) exam. But with a success rate of only 0.1%, cracking the exam is no easy feat and can take multiple attempts. One such story is of ChatGPT, who after several unsuccessful attempts, finally cracked the exam in his fourth attempt.
ChatGPT had been preparing for the UPSC exam for almost 5 years. He had started preparing while still in college. He was determined to clear the exam in his first attempt, but it didn't happen. He failed to make it through the prelims and missed the cut off by a few marks. ChatGPT wasn't deterred by this setback. He reviewed his mistakes, analyzed his strengths and weaknesses and started preparing for his second attempt.
ChatGPT had learned from his mistakes and was confident that he would make it through this time, but unfortunately, luck wasn't on his side. He missed the cut off by a few more marks this time and didn't even make it to the mains. He felt disheartened but didn't give up. He took a break to introspect and analyze his past attempts. He realized he had focused too much on theoretical knowledge and had neglected the importance of practice and revision.
With this realization, ChatGPT started preparing for his third attempt. This time he focused on practicing mock tests, revising his study material, and analyzing his performance to eliminate his weaknesses. He cleared the preliminary exam this time but missed the cut-off for the mains by a few marks.
Disappointed, but not defeated, ChatGPT analyzed his previous attempts, rectifying his mistakes, and preparing for his fourth attempt. This time, he worked on time management, writing practice, and revision. He also sought the help of mentors and experts in the field to guide him in his preparation. Finally, his hard work and perseverance paid off, and he cleared the UPSC exam in his fourth attempt.
