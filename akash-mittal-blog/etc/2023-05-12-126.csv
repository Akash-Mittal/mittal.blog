"2023-05-22 10:25 PM;","Jenna Bush Hager, daughter of former President George W. Bush and former First Lady Laura Bush, faced many challenges raising her three children. She often turned to her mom for advice on how to be a better parent. In a recent interview, she shared the best parenting lessons she has learned from her mom.
One of Laura's best parenting lessons is to always be present and engaged with your children. She would frequently put aside her own plans and activities to spend time with her daughters, whether it was playing a game, reading a book, or simply listening to them talk about their day. This made her daughters feel loved and valued, and helped to build strong relationships.
Another lesson from Laura is to be consistent with discipline. She would set clear expectations for her daughters and follow through with consequences when those expectations were not met. This helped her daughters learn to be responsible and accountable for their actions.
A final lesson from Laura is to teach your children to be kind and compassionate. She modeled this behavior by volunteering and giving back to her community, and encouraged her daughters to do the same.
