     <p>It was a warm Monday morning when Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, arrived at Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos, Nigeria. He was on a tour of African countries to learn about the latest developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and meet with local entrepreneurs and innovators. His visit to Nigeria was highly anticipated, and the tech community was buzzing with excitement.</p>
     <p>Altman's first stop was at the Co-Creation Hub (CCHub), a leading Nigerian innovation center that has supported over 120 startups in its nine years of existence. He was welcomed by Bosun Tijani, the CEO, who gave him a tour of the facility. Altman was impressed by the level of creativity and innovation at CCHub, and he spent several hours meeting with startup founders and learning about their projects.</p>
     <p>Altman was particularly fascinated by a project that was using drones to deliver medical supplies to remote areas. The startup, called LifeBank, had a fleet of drones that were equipped with medical kits and could fly to hard-to-reach locations in under 30 minutes. Altman was amazed by the potential of this technology to save lives and improve healthcare access in Africa.</p>
     <p>Altman's next stop was at Andela, a company that trains African software developers and connects them with top employers around the world. Andela had recently become one of the first African companies to partner with OpenAI, and Altman was keen to see how they were using AI in their training programs.</p>
     <p>At Andela, Altman met with the company's co-founder, Christina Sass, and several of the trainees. They showed him how they were using AI to personalize the learning experience for each trainee, based on their strengths and weaknesses. They also demoed an AI-powered chatbot that was designed to help trainees with technical issues. Altman was impressed by the efficiency of the chatbot and the potential for scaling the technology to other training programs.</p>
     <p>Altman's final stop in Nigeria was at Flutterwave, a fintech company that had recently raised $35 million in funding. Flutterwave was using AI to improve their payment processing system and reduce fraud. Altman met with the CEO, Olugbenga Agboola, and several engineers who showed him how they were using machine learning to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions. Altman was impressed by the level of sophistication of the system and the potential for scaling it to other industries.</p>
     <p>Altman's visit to Nigeria was a game-changer for the AI industry in Africa. His interactions with local startups and innovators brought attention to the potential of AI in solving some of the continent's most pressing problems, such as healthcare access, education, and financial inclusion. Altman was also impressed by the level of talent and creativity in Nigeria's tech community and expressed his desire to continue working with them in the future.</p>
