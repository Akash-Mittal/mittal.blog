    <h2>How Our Online Experience is Being Ruined</h2>
    <p>Have you ever been scrolling through your social media feed or browsing a news website, only to be bombarded with clickbait articles, invasive ads, and sponsored content? It's enough to make you want to give up on the internet altogether.</p>
    <p>But it's not just annoying; it's dangerous. Fake news and misinformation run rampant, and our personal information is constantly being harvested and sold to the highest bidder. This is the result of what has been dubbed "enshittification" - the degradation of the internet by clickbait, propaganda, and other low-quality content.</p>
    <p>So how do we fight back?</p>

    <h2>The Toll of Enshittification</h2>
    <p>The effects of enshittification can be seen in every corner of the internet. It's easy to be fooled by misleading headlines and sensationalized stories, and it's not always clear who is behind them. One study found that in the 2016 election, fake news stories on social media were shared more than real news stories.</p>
    <p>But it's not just about politics. Enshittification affects our mental health as well. The constant barrage of negativity and sensationalism can lead to anxiety and depression, and the pressure to keep up with the latest trends and fads can contribute to a sense of inadequacy and FOMO (fear of missing out).</p>
    <p>And let's not forget about the financial toll. It's estimated that ad fraud costs businesses around $23 billion each year, and the average person now spends $1,000 a year on subscription services. That's not even taking into account the cost of data breaches and identity theft.</p>

    <h2>The Fight Against Enshittification</h2>
    <p>So what can we do to combat enshittification and reclaim the internet?</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Be skeptical of everything you read and see online. Fact-check, verify sources, and don't believe everything you see on social media.</li>
     <li>Use ad blockers and privacy extensions to protect your personal information and block invasive ads.</li>
     <li>Support high-quality journalism and content creators by subscribing to their websites and newsletters.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It's not going to be easy, but it's necessary. We need to work together to demand a better internet that's free from clickbait, propaganda, and other low-quality content. The future of the internet depends on it.</p>
