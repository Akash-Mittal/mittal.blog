  <p>Once upon a time, there was a teacher who always had a hard time in grading her students' exam papers. She can't seem to keep up with the workload and still find time to rest. So, she decided to give an artificial intelligence application called ChatGPT a try.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In no time, her life got easier. No more paper stacks on her desk, and she doesn't have to spend hours grading papers. ChatGPT did the trick, and she was able to appreciate her time more.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The use of artificial intelligence, like ChatGPT, is becoming more prevalent, but is it for everyone? Some Austin area school districts have banned the use of ChatGPT, while others are incorporating it into their systems. The reasons for these decisions are a mix of opinions and beliefs. Here are some quantifiable examples that may help you see the picture.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Banning ChatGPT:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Loss of personal touch – Using artificial intelligence can lead to the loss of a personal touch between students and educators. A teacher who uses ChatGPT most of the time may not pick up on nonverbal cues that students have to show distress.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Disadvantageous to special needs learners – Artificial intelligence may not always cater to the needs of special needs learners. Educators who use ChatGPT most of the time may not understand the learning needs of disabled students.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Bots don't replace competent teachers – Artificial intelligence may make grading easier, but it does not, in any way, replace the importance of having a competent teacher. Understanding the context of learning is a critical factor in an educator's role.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Incorporating ChatGPT:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Saves time – The use of ChatGPT can help teachers save time and allocate more time in engaging with students rather than grading papers.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Consistent grading – ChatGPT provides consistent grading, which can be helpful for educators who struggle with maintaining grading standards.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Helps in tracking student analytics – The data gathered by ChatGPT can be used to track student analytics, which can help educators identify early signs of problems and attend to them early on.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In conclusion, the decision to incorporate artificial intelligence like ChatGPT into classrooms is a mix of a personal approach and technological enhancement. While ChatGPT can offer a lot of benefits, it may not be for everyone, as it can lead to the loss of personal touch and disadvantageous to some learners. However, incorporating ChatGPT can help save time, provide consistent grading, and track student analytics.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Personal anecdotes and case studies help illustrate points by providing real-life scenarios, which can be relatable to the readers. So, if you're considering incorporating ChatGPT into your system, here are some practical tips:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Have a balance – Don't rely too much on ChatGPT, always have a balance, so you don't lose track of the personal touch of learning.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Understand your learners – Grading with ChatGPT doesn't excuse an educator from understanding learners' needs. Always keep in mind that ChatGPT is just a tool.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. The human teacher's role – The primary role of a teacher is to educate, and ChatGPT is just a tool to enhance the process. Don't rely solely on it.</p>
