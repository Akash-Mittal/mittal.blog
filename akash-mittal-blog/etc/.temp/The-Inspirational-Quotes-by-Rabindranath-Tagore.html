   <p>Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Shruti who lived in a small village in India. She was passionate about education but due to social and financial constraints, she couldn't pursue it. One day, she stumbled upon a book of poems by Rabindranath Tagore and was captivated by the wisdom and inspiration she found.</p>
   <p>Tagore, who was a prolific writer, philosopher, and social reformer, is known for his profound quotes that continue to inspire millions across the world. On his birth anniversary, let's revisit some of his most inspiring quotes and see how they can be applied in real life.</p>
   <h2>1. "Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high"</h2>
   <p>This quote reflects the importance of freedom and self-confidence. In today's world, many people face fear and discrimination due to their race, religion, gender, or sexuality. Companies such as Google and Microsoft are actively promoting diversity and inclusion in their workplaces to create a sense of belonging for all employees.</p>
   <p>Google, for instance, has a diversity and inclusion team that works on initiatives such as unconscious bias training, employee resource groups, and outreach programs. Microsoft has launched a Disability Answer Desk to provide technical support to customers with disabilities.</p>
   <h2>2. "You can't cross the sea merely by standing and staring at the water"</h2>
   <p>This quote emphasizes the importance of taking action and making bold choices. In entrepreneurship, risk-taking is essential for growth and innovation. Take the example of Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX and Tesla, who has taken risky decisions such as launching reusable rockets and building electric cars despite skepticism from the industry.</p>
   <p>Musk's bold moves have not only revolutionized the space and automotive industries but also inspired others to think outside the box and pursue their dreams.</p>
   <h2>3. "I slept and dreamt that life was joy. I awoke and saw that life was service. I acted and behold, service was joy"</h2>
   <p>This quote encapsulates the essence of service and giving back to society. Many people find meaning and fulfillment in volunteering and charity work. Companies such as Salesforce and TOMS have integrated social responsibility into their business models and are making a positive impact on the world.</p>
   <p>Salesforce's 1-1-1 model, which pledges 1% of their equity, product, and employee time to charity, has resulted in over $320 million in grants and 5 million hours of volunteer work. TOMS, which donates a pair of shoes to a person in need for every pair sold, has given away over 100 million pairs of shoes and supports social causes such as ending gun violence and promoting mental health.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
