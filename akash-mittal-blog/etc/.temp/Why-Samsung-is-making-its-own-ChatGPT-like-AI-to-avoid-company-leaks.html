  <h1>Why Samsung is making its own ChatGPT like AI to avoid company leaks</h1> <img src="images/Why-Samsung-is-making-its-own-ChatGPT-like-AI-to-avoid-company-leaks.jpeg" alt="+Why-Samsung-is-making-its-own-ChatGPT-like-AI-to-avoid-company-leaks+">
  <p>It was a typical Monday morning in Samsung Headquarters when a group of executives stumbled upon a confidential document lying on the floor. As they picked it up and read its contents, they realized that it was a top-secret plan for a new product that had not been announced yet. Panic set in as they realized that their competitors might have already seen the document, and their plans could be compromised.</p>
  <p>After a thorough investigation, it was discovered that the document had been accidentally dropped by a junior employee who was not authorized to see it in the first place. This incident highlighted the need for a more secure way of sharing information within the company.</p>
  <p>This was not the first time such an incident had occurred in Samsung. In the past, there were cases of leaks that had cost the company millions of dollars in revenue and tarnished its reputation. As a result, Samsung decided to take action and come up with a solution to prevent such incidents from happening in the future.</p>
  <h2>Why Samsung is making its own ChatGPT-like AI</h2>
  <p>One of the solutions Samsung came up with was to develop their own AI chatbot, similar to ChatGPT, that could help employees communicate in a more secure way. The chatbot would be able to understand natural language and provide answers to questions, without the need for human involvement.</p>
  <p>But why would Samsung want to go through the trouble of building their own ChatGPT-like AI? One reason is that ChatGPT is an open-source platform, which means that anyone can access its code and potentially discover vulnerabilities that can be exploited. By developing their own AI chatbot, Samsung can have complete control over its security and ensure that the chances of a leak happening are minimized.</p>
  <p>In addition, Samsung's chatbot will be specifically tailored to their needs, taking into account the unique language and communication styles within the company. This will make it easier for employees to use and increase the chances of it being adopted throughout the organization.</p>
  <h2>Examples of how AI chatbots can prevent leaks</h2>
  <p>AI chatbots have proven to be effective in preventing leaks and security breaches in other companies. For example, in 2019, Intel implemented an AI chatbot that could detect and prevent phishing attacks. The chatbot was able to recognize suspicious emails and alert employees before they fell victim to a scam.</p>
  <p>Similarly, Coca-Cola uses an AI-powered chatbot to monitor internal communication and flag any suspicious activity. By analyzing language patterns and identifying anomalies, the chatbot has successfully prevented several potential breaches.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, Samsung's decision to develop their own ChatGPT-like AI is a smart move that will help them protect their sensitive information and prevent leaks. By tailoring the chatbot to their needs and ensuring its security, Samsung can create a more secure environment for their employees to communicate in.</p>
