  <h1>Why Low Labour Productivity Persists</h1> <img src="images/Why-Low-Labour-Productivity-Persists.jpeg" alt="+Why-Low-Labour-Productivity-Persists+">
  <p>It was a Monday morning and Elizabeth, a factory worker, was starting her shift. She had been working at the factory for the past year and had noticed that despite working hard, the output of the factory had not increased. She often wondered why this was the case and decided to investigate.</p>
  <p>Low labour productivity is a persistent problem that affects many countries, including Uganda. Productivity is the measure of the amount of output that is produced by a unit of input, such as labour. Low productivity means that a lot of resources are being used to produce less output, resulting in decreased economic growth and competitiveness.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Low Labour Productivity</h2>
  <p>In Uganda, productivity is low in various sectors of the economy, including agriculture, manufacturing, and services. For instance, the average yield of maize in Uganda is about 1.5-1.7 metric tons per hectare, compared to an average of 5 metric tons per hectare in other African countries. In the manufacturing sector, the average labour productivity is about $48, compared to $150 in Vietnam.</p>
  <p>These examples show that Uganda is lagging behind other countries in terms of productivity, and this needs to change for the country to achieve sustainable economic growth.</p>
  <h2>Causes of Low Labour Productivity</h2>
  <p>Low labour productivity in Uganda can be attributed to several factors, including:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Poor infrastructure</li>
   <li>Lack of skills and education</li>
   <li>Low levels of investment</li>
   <li>Low wages and poor working conditions</li>
   <li>Limited access to finance</li>
  </ol>
  <p>These factors, combined with others, create an environment that is not conducive to productivity, and they need to be addressed to improve productivity levels.</p>
  <h2>Conclusions</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, low labour productivity is a persistent problem in Uganda, but it can be addressed by taking concrete actions, such as:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Investing in education and skills development</li>
   <li>Improving infrastructure</li>
   <li>Increasing access to finance</li>
  </ol>
  <p>These actions, combined with others, will lead to improved productivity levels that will have a positive impact on the economy and the livelihoods of Ugandans.</p>
