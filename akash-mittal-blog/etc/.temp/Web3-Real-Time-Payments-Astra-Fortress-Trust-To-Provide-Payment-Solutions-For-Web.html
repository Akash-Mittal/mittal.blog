     <h2>An Interesting Story</h2>
     <p>Leila was a freelancer who worked for clients around the world. She had clients in the United States, Canada, France, and Australia. Leila’s clients always paid her through PayPal or wire transfers which often took up to three days to clear. The long wait times meant that Leila had to postpone important payments like rent, phone bills, and groceries. She wished she could receive payment in real-time so that she could pay her bills on time.</p>
     <p>Then one day, Leila heard about Web3, a new technology that used blockchain to enable real-time payments. She was interested in Web3 because it promised to provide fast, secure, and cheap transactions. She decided to test it out. She opened a Web3 wallet and sent an invoice to her client in Canada. Within minutes, she received payment in her wallet. She was pleasantly surprised. She could now pay her bills on time and save money on expensive wire transfer fees!</p>
     <p>Leila’s experience illustrates a common problem faced by freelancers, small businesses, and individuals around the world. Traditional payment methods are slow, expensive, and cumbersome. Web3 promises to solve this problem by providing a decentralized, secure, and fast payment infrastructure that can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection.</p>

     <h2>Quantifiable Examples</h2>
     <p>Web3 promises to provide a faster, cheaper, and more secure payment infrastructure than traditional methods. Let’s look at some quantifiable examples of how Web3 compares to traditional payment methods:</p>
     <ul>
      <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Web3 enables real-time payments, which means that transactions can be processed within seconds or minutes. Traditional methods like wire transfers and PayPal can take up to three days to clear.</li>
      <li><strong>Cheaper:</strong> Web3 transactions are typically cheaper than traditional methods. For example, PayPal charges a fee of 2.9% plus $0.30 per transaction. Web3 fees are usually lower than 1%.</li>
      <li><strong>More Secure:</strong> Web3 provides a decentralized, secure, and transparent payment infrastructure that is immune to hacking, fraud, and cyber attacks. Traditional methods are vulnerable to security breaches, which can result in financial losses and reputational damage.</li>
     </ul>
