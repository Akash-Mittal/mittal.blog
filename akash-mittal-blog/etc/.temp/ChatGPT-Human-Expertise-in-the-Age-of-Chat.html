  <main>
   <p>Have you ever had a frustrating interaction with a chatbot? Maybe you needed to speak to a human, but couldn't find an option. Or perhaps you felt like the chatbot wasn't understanding your questions.</p>
   <p>Enter ChatGPT. This AI-powered chat platform uses human intelligence to provide better customer service. Unlike standard chatbots, ChatGPT is programmed with the knowledge and expertise of human experts. This allows for more nuanced responses and a better customer experience.</p>
   <h3>Real-Life Examples</h3>
   <p>Several major companies are already using ChatGPT to improve their customer service. For example:</p>
   <ol>
    <li><a href="https://www.jetblue.com/">JetBlue</a> uses ChatGPT to provide personalized travel recommendations to customers. The platform takes into account factors like budget, travel preferences, and loyalty status to provide tailored recommendations.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.nike.com/">Nike</a> uses ChatGPT to answer questions about products and make recommendations based on customers' fitness goals. The platform is able to draw on a vast database of product information and fitness knowledge to provide helpful responses.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a> uses ChatGPT in its customer service division to triage customer inquiries. The platform is able to determine which inquiries can be solved by a chatbot, and which should be directed to a human expert. This helps to streamline the customer service process and ensure that customers get accurate, helpful information quickly.</li>
   </ol>
   <h3>Conclusion</h3>
   <p>ChatGPT represents an exciting new development in the world of chatbots and AI. By incorporating human expertise, companies are able to provide more personalized, accurate customer service. However, it's important to remember that ChatGPT is only as good as the human experts behind it. Companies must invest in expert knowledge and ensure that the platform is programmed with accurate information in order to provide the best possible experience for customers.</p>
