    <p class="lead">It all started with a problem. Jane, a beauty enthusiast, was tired of the lack of diversity in the beauty industry. She wanted products that were tailored to her specific needs and preferences, but she couldn't find anything that fit the bill. That's when she had an idea - what if she could create her own beauty brand with the help of other like-minded individuals?</p>
    <p class="body">Thus, the Web3 Ready Beauty Brand was born. It is a brand that is co-created by its community and produced using AI technology.
