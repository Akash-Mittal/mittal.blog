   <p>As a medical professional, I have seen the incredible advancements that technology has brought to the field of healthcare. However, I have also witnessed the potential harm that can come when technology is not used responsibly. That is why I believe it is crucial to humanize AI in medical training.</p>
   <p>A few years ago, I had a patient who was diagnosed with a rare disease. The doctors were unsure of how to treat it, so they turned to an AI program for guidance. Unfortunately, the program did not take into account the unique circumstances of my patient's case and recommended a treatment that ended up causing additional harm.</p>
   <p>While this is just one example, it highlights the need for a responsible, ethical framework to guide the development and use of AI in medical training. Here are three key points to consider:</p>
   <h2>1. Prioritize Patient Care</h2>
   <p>At the heart of AI in medical training, should be a focus on improving patient outcomes and care. This means that any AI tools used should be designed with the patient in mind, and the training provided to medical professionals should prioritize the skills needed to provide compassionate, personalized care.</p>
   <p>There are countless examples of how AI can be used to improve patient care. For example, AI algorithms can analyze large datasets to identify patterns and signals that may indicate a particular condition or disease. This can help doctors make more accurate diagnoses and develop more effective treatment plans.</p>
   <h2>2. Address Bias and Inequality</h2>
   <p>AI is only as good as the data it is trained on. Unfortunately, this means that if the data used is biased or incomplete, the AI tools developed will perpetuate those biases. This is especially concerning in healthcare, where biases and inequalities can have life or death consequences.</p>
   <p>One way to address this issue is to ensure that the data used to train AI tools is diverse and representative. Additionally, AI algorithms should be regularly audited to identify and correct any biases that may have been inadvertently introduced.</p>
   <h2>3. Foster Collaboration and Transparency</h2>
   <p>Finally, it is crucial to foster collaboration and transparency between developers, medical professionals, and patients. This includes involving patients in the development of AI tools and ensuring that they are aware of how their data is being used.</p>
   <p>Transparency also means being upfront about the limitations of AI tools and recognizing that they are not a replacement for human expertise and intuition. Instead, they should be seen as a tool to enhance and support healthcare practices.</p>
   <h2>Quantifiable Examples</h2>
   <p>The benefits of humanizing AI in medical training can be seen in several quantifiable examples. For instance, a study in the Journal of the American College of Radiology found that an AI algorithm designed to detect breast cancer in mammograms was able to achieve an accuracy rate of 90 percent, compared to human radiologists' accuracy rate of 88 percent.</p>
   <p>In another study by the University of Pennsylvania, an AI algorithm was able to predict patients at risk of developing sepsis up to 12 hours before it occurred with an accuracy rate of 85 percent. This can help medical professionals intervene early and potentially save lives.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>When used responsibly and in support of patient care, AI can be a valuable tool in medical training. However, it is crucial to humanize AI by prioritizing patient care, addressing biases and inequalities, and fostering collaboration and transparency.</p>
