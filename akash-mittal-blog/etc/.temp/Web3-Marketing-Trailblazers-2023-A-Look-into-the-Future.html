    <p>It all started in 2018 when Telly Wong, the creative director at IW Group, had his first encounter with blockchain technology. He was attending a tech conference in Las Vegas when he stumbled upon a booth showcasing a new type of digital currency called "Bitcoin". Fascinated by the concept, Telly dug deeper and discovered the world of Web3, a decentralized internet where users could control their own data and identities. He saw the potential for a whole new era of marketing - one that could revolutionize the way we interacted with brands.</p>

     <h3>Brave Browser</h3>
     <p>Brave Browser is a free, private web browser that blocks ads and trackers by default. It also offers a rewards program that pays users in cryptocurrency for opting-in to view ads. Brave Browser recently introduced a new feature called "Brave Search", a privacy-focused search engine that uses its own index and algorithms to provide users with accurate results without compromising their data. This puts control back into the hands of the user and gives brands a unique opportunity to reach engaged audiences in a new way.</p><a href="https://brave.com/">Brave Browser Website</a>
