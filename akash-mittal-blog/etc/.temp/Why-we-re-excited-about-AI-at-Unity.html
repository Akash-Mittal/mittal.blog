    <p>Let me tell you a story about a game developer named Susan. Susan was working on a new mobile game that she hoped would become a hit. She had spent months creating the perfect game mechanics, designing the levels, and polishing the graphics. But something was missing.</p>
    <p>The game felt too mechanical, predictable, and easy to beat. Players would quickly lose interest and move on to something else. Susan realized that she needed to add a new level of intelligence to the game, something that could adapt to the player's skills, preferences, and behavior.</p>
    <p>That's when she discovered the power of AI at Unity.</p>
    <p>With AI, Susan could create a game that would learn from the player's actions, make strategic decisions based on the context, and provide personalized challenges and rewards. She could also save time by automating some of the repetitive tasks such as enemy behavior, pathfinding, and animation.</p>
    <p>By adding AI to her game, Susan saw a dramatic improvement in player engagement, retention, and monetization. She also discovered new creative possibilities and unlocked a whole new level of fun.</p>
    <h2>Quantifiable examples</h2>
    <p>Let's take a look at some of the quantifiable benefits of AI for game developers:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Improved player engagement: games with personalized AI experiences have an average longer session time of 33.3 minutes compared to 21.0 minutes for non-AI games (<a href="https://gaming.adobe.com/insights/how-ai-is-changing-the-gaming-industry-now-and-in-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe</a>)</li>
     <li>Higher player retention: AI-based games have an average retention rate of 38.6% on day 1, compared to 17.9% for non-AI games (<a href="https://www.curvegames.io/2021/05/17/what-is-ai-in-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Curve Games</a>)</li>
     <li>Increase in monetization: games with AI-driven personalized rewards have an average revenue boost of 10-20% compared to non-personalized games (<a href="https://www.ctower.com/blog/how-ai-is-changing-the-gaming-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ctower</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why we're excited</h2>
    <p>The Unity community is buzzing with excitement about AI, and here are some of the reasons why:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>AI democratizes game development: with Unity's AI tools and services, game developers of all skill levels and budgets can add AI to their games without having to be AI experts. Unity offers a range of pre-trained models, easy-to-use APIs, and visual editors that make AI accessible and intuitive.</li>
     <li>AI unlocks new creative possibilities: with AI, game developers can create immersive and dynamic game worlds, where characters, objects, and environments behave and react in lifelike ways. AI also enables new game genres, such as procedurally generated content, emergent gameplay, and adaptive narrative.</li>
     <li>AI shapes the future of gaming: as AI technologies continue to evolve and improve, they will enable new forms of gaming, such as cross-platform play, real-time multiplayer, procedural generation, and personalized experiences. AI will also play a key role in enhancing player safety, diversity, and accessibility.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>AI is a game-changer: AI is not a buzzword or a passing trend; it is a powerful tool that has the potential to revolutionize the gaming industry in many ways.</li>
     <li>AI is accessible: game developers can start using AI today, regardless of their skills and budget.</li>
     <li>AI is fun: by incorporating AI into their games, developers can create more engaging, immersive, and enjoyable experiences for players.</li>
    </ol>
