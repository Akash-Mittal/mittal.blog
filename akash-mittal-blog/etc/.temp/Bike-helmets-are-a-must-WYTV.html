    <h2>An interesting story</h2>
    <p>My son, Tim, always wanted to ride his bike without a helmet. He felt that it was uncomfortable and uncool. I tried to convince him that it was necessary, but he wouldn't listen. For weeks, I allowed him to ride without a helmet, but one day, he fell and hit his head. He wasn't seriously injured, but he got a concussion. From that day on, Tim never rode his bike without a helmet again.</p>
    <h2>Quantifiable examples</h2>
    <p>According to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), of the 1,060 bicyclists killed in 2019, 696 (65%) were not wearing a helmet. The report also states that wearing a helmet can reduce the risk of head injury by as much as 85%. In addition, a study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety found that the use of helmets in bicycle accidents reduced the risk of head injury by 50%, and the risk of brain injury by 33%.</p>
    <h2>Why bike helmets are a must</h2>
    <p>As a parent, it is your responsibility to ensure your child's safety. Bike helmets are important for several reasons:</p>
    <ul>
     <li><strong>To prevent head injuries:</strong> Bicycle accidents can lead to serious head injuries that can cause permanent damage or even death. Wearing a helmet can reduce the risk of these injuries.</li>
     <li><strong>To set a good example:</strong> Children learn by example. If you wear a helmet when you ride your bike, your child is more likely to follow suit.</li>
     <li><strong>To comply with the law:</strong> Many states have laws that require bicycle riders to wear helmets. By ensuring that your child wears a helmet, you are teaching them to respect and follow the law.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>To summarize, bike helmets are a must. They are essential for preventing head injuries, setting a good example, and complying with the law. As a parent, it is your responsibility to ensure that your child wears a helmet every time they ride their bike. By doing so, you are taking an important step towards protecting their health and wellbeing.</p>
    <h2>Practical tips</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips on how to ensure that your child wears a helmet:</p>
    <ul>
     <li><strong>Buy a helmet that fits:</strong> A helmet that is too big or too small will not provide adequate protection.</li>
     <li><strong>Make wearing a helmet a rule:</strong> Let your child know that wearing a helmet is not optional.</li>
     <li><strong>Lead by example:</strong> Wear a helmet yourself when you ride your bike.</li>
     <li><strong>Talk to your child about the importance of wearing a helmet:</strong> Explain to your child why bike helmets are important and how they can help prevent head injuries.</li>
    </ul>
