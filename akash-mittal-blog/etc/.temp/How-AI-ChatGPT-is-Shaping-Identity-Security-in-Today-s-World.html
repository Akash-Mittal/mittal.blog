    <h2>An Interesting Story</h2>
    <p>Imagine that you are trying to reset the password for your online banking account. You enter your username and your email address, then the system asks you to answer a security question. You type in your mother's maiden name, but it says it's incorrect. You try again with a different answer, but it still doesn't work. You call the bank's customer support line and go through the security verification process on the phone. After several minutes of answering questions, the customer support representative approves your request and resets your password.</p>
    <p>Now, imagine that instead of going through this lengthy and frustrating process, you simply had to chat with an AI-powered system that already knew all of your personal information and could verify your identity in seconds. This is the power of AI ChatGPT in identity security.</p>
