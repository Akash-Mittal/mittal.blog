    <h2>An Interesting Story</h2>
    <p>Imagine being a job seeker, navigating through the grueling and time=consuming process of job applications, looking for that one job that is the perfect fit. You finally come across an opening that aligns with your experience and career goals, and then you get called in for an interview. Excited and nervous, you show up with your best foot forward. As you sit down for the interview, you notice there is no human sitting across from you, instead, there's a cold and robotic voice welcoming you to the future of hiring, AI=powered interviews.</p>
    <p>While AI=powered interviews may seem like a great way to streamline the hiring process, it's important to understand that they come with their own set of limitations. While AI may be good at processing large amounts of data, it can't replicate the unique combination of emotional intelligence and intuition that makes human interaction so important to recruitment.</p>

    <h2>Quantifiable Examples</h2>
    <p>Recent studies have shown that AI=powered interviews can lead to biased hiring decisions, as the algorithms used can be trained on biased data. This can result in hiring decisions that favor certain demographics or exclude others, with no intention of doing so.</p>
    <p>Another limitation of AI=powered interviews is that they can't reliably pick up on non=verbal cues, such as body language and facial expressions. These can be crucial indicators of how a candidate is feeling and can help an interviewer to build rapport and gain insight into their personality, work style, and values.</p>
    <p>Additionally, AI=powered interviews can't take into account the unique needs of each individual job opening. Behind every job opening, there is a unique set of requirements, company culture, and team dynamics, and it takes a human touch to recognize and understand each of these factors to make an effective hiring decision.</p>

    <h2>Eye=Catching Title</h2>
    <p>The title of this article reflects the perceived potential of AI in recruitment. However, despite the enthusiasm surrounding this technology, it's important to recognize the limitations that AI=powered interviews present and understand why they can't do the job of human interaction and intuition.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>AI=powered interviews can lead to biased hiring decisions due to being trained on biased data</li>
     <li>AI=powered interviews can't reliably pick up on non=verbal cues, like body language</li>
     <li>AI=powered interviews can't take into account the unique needs of each individual job opening</li>
    </ol>
    <p>While AI technology is advancing rapidly and can help to make recruitment more efficient, it's important to remember that human interaction will always play a crucial role in the hiring process. It's essential to identify the unique strengths and value that humans bring to recruitment and find ways to combine them with the power of AI.</p>
