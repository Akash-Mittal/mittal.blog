   <p>It's every student's worst nightmare: receiving an email from their instructor accusing them of cheating in a class. But what if the accusation wasn't just about using someone else's work or sharing answers during an exam? What if the accusation involved using an AI language model to write essays and complete assignments?</p>
   <p>That's exactly what happened to a class at Texas A&amp;M University, where an instructor accused some students of using the AI language model ChatGPT to complete their assignments. The accusation came after the instructor noticed that some of the submitted work had a high similarity score with text generated by ChatGPT.</p>
   <p>While the use of AI models in education is not new, this incident brings up important questions about the role of technology in learning and the ethics of using AI for academic purposes. Here are three key takeaways from this story:</p>
   <section>
    <h2>AI is becoming more accessible and easier to use</h2>
    <p>One of the reasons why AI models are being used more frequently in education is their accessibility. ChatGPT, for example, is a pre=trained language model that can generate human=like text with minimal input from users. This means that students don't need to have advanced coding skills or access to expensive infrastructure to use the model.</p>
    <p>While this may sound like a positive development, it also means that the barrier to entry for using AI in academic dishonesty has been lowered. Students who are not familiar with AI models could use them to cheat without fully understanding how they work or the consequences of their actions.</p>

    <h2>Academic integrity policies may need to be updated</h2>
    <p>As the use of AI models becomes more common in education, institutions will need to update their academic integrity policies to reflect this reality. While cheating with AI is still a relatively new phenomenon, instructors and academic administrators will need to be aware of the potential for misuse and take appropriate actions to prevent and detect cheating.</p>
    <p>One possible solution is to use plagiarism detection tools that are specifically designed to identify text generated by AI models. These tools can be used to compare student work with known text generated by models like ChatGPT, providing a reliable way to detect cheating and take appropriate actions.</p>

    <h2>Education is changing, and technology is a part of it</h2>
    <p>While the use of AI models for cheating is certainly a cause for concern, it's also important to recognize the role that technology is playing in education as a whole. As institutions adapt to changing student needs and demands, they are exploring new ways to use technology to enhance the learning process.</p>
    <p>For example, AI models can be used to personalize learning experiences, providing students with customized feedback and support based on their individual needs. They can also be used to help students with disabilities, such as by generating audio descriptions of visual content or providing real=time translation services to non=native speakers.</p>
