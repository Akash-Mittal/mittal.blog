  <h1>BKEX: Joining the Ranks of Web3 Killer Whales with Shark Tank</h1> <img src="images/BKEX=Joins=Shark=Tank=of=Web3=Killer=Whales.jpeg" alt="+BKEX=Joins=Shark=Tank=of=Web3=Killer=Whales+">
  <p>It all started with a shared passion for decentralization and blockchain technology. A group of industry experts, led by the CEO of BKEX, gathered to discuss the challenges and opportunities of Web3. As they brainstormed ways to accelerate the adoption of decentralized applications, they realized that they needed to do more than just create a platform. They needed to create a community.</p>
  <p>The solution was simple: they would launch Shark Tank, an incubator program that would help promising Web3 startups get off the ground. The goal was to empower entrepreneurs to create solutions that would decentralize the internet, while also providing them with the resources they needed to succeed.</p>
  <h2>Quantifiable Examples:</h2>
  <p>So far, the Shark Tank program has been highly successful. Since its launch, the program has incubated over 50 startups, providing them with funding, mentorship, and access to industry experts. Many of these startups have gone on to raise additional funding, launch successful products, and join the ranks of the Web3 killer whales.</p>
  <p>For example, one of the startups that participated in the Shark Tank program was NFTify, a platform that enables businesses to create their own branded NFTs. In just a few months, NFTify has raised $2.5 million in funding, signed partnerships with major brands such as Adidas and BMW, and helped over 3000 businesses create their own branded NFTs.</p>
  <p>Another startup that participated in the program was Switcheo, a decentralized exchange that enables users to trade cryptocurrencies in a secure and decentralized manner. Since graduating from the program, Switcheo has raised $20 million in funding, launched a mobile app, and expanded its offering to include new markets and asset classes.</p>
