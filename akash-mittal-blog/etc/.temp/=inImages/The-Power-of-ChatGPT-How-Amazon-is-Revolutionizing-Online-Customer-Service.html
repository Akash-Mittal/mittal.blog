    <p>At Amazon, ChatGPT is being used in a number of ways: from answering simple questions about products, to helping customers track their orders, to recommending products based on a customer's buying habits. The technology is also being used to personalize the shopping experience for customers, tailoring product recommendations and offers to each individual.</p>
