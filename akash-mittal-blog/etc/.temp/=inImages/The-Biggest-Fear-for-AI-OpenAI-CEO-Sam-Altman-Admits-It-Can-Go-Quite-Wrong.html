    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>Imagine a world where machines can think, learn, and act like humans. It sounds exciting, doesn't it? However, as with any technology, artificial intelligence (AI) comes with potential risks and dangers that could harm society.</p>
    <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman knows all too well about those risks and dangers. In a recent interview with <em>60 Minutes</em>, he revealed his biggest fear for AI: it can go quite wrong.</p>
    <p>Altman explained that AI is like a very powerful tool that can either be used for good or for bad. If we're not careful, it could have unintended consequences that we haven't even thought about yet.</p>
    <blockquote>
     "I think the biggest risk is something we're not thinking about," Altman said. "Just like we didn't think about the rise of the internet and what that would do to our society, we're not thinking about all the things that could go wrong with AI."
    </blockquote>
    <p>So what are those things that could go wrong with AI? Let's take a look at some quantifiable examples.</p>

   <section id="quantifiable=examples">
    <h2>Quantifiable Examples</h2>
    <p>One of the biggest concerns about AI is that it could lead to massive job loss. According to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute, as many as 800 million jobs around the world could be automated by 2030.</p>
    <p>Another concern is that AI could worsen inequality and bias. For example, if we train AI systems on biased data, they will learn and replicate those biases, leading to unfair outcomes in areas such as hiring, lending, and policing. A recent study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that a widely used algorithm for predicting future criminals was biased against black defendants.</p>
    <p>AI also has the potential to be used maliciously. For instance, AI=powered cyberattacks could be much more sophisticated and destructive than what we've seen so far. In fact, researchers at the University of Cambridge recently demonstrated how AI could be used to create realistic videos of people saying and doing things they never actually did.</p>
    <p>These are just a few examples of the risks associated with AI. It's clear that we need to take these risks seriously and think carefully about how we develop and deploy AI.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Sam Altman's fear for AI is justified. If we're not cautious, AI could have unintended consequences that could harm society. However, that doesn't mean we should stop developing AI altogether. Instead, we need to be vigilant and take steps to mitigate the risks associated with this powerful technology.</p>
    <p>Here are a few takeaways to keep in mind:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>We need to ensure that AI systems are transparent, trustworthy, and accountable. That means understanding how they work, what data they use, and how they make decisions.</li>
     <li>We need to address the potential social and economic impacts of AI, including job displacement, inequality, and bias. That means investing in education and retraining programs, and working to create new jobs in areas where AI cannot replace human workers.</li>
     <li>We need to establish ethical principles and guidelines for the development and deployment of AI. That means engaging in a public conversation about the risks and benefits of AI, and involving a diverse range of stakeholders in decision=making.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>By taking these steps, we can maximize the benefits of AI while minimizing the risks. It's up to us to shape the future of AI in a way that serves everyone.</p>
