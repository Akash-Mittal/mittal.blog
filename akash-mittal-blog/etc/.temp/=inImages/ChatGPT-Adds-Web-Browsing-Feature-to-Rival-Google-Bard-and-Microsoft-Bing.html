    <p>In an effort to stand out in the competitive search engine market, ChatGPT has launched a new feature that allows users to not just search for websites but also browse them within the ChatGPT app itself. The new feature has been released in direct competition with search engine giants Google Bard and Microsoft Bing.</p>
    <p>The new feature is designed to revolutionize the search engine experience by making it much more user=friendly and convenient. Rather than opening multiple tabs and windows to view your search results, ChatGPT allows users to browse websites in the same app, without having to switch between different tabs or windows.</p>
    <p>The feature is particularly useful for those who like to browse multiple websites at once, as it makes it much easier to manage different sites from one centralized location. Additionally, the new feature provides a more seamless browsing experience, which is essential for those who value speed and convenience.</p>
