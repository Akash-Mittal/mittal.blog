    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>Imagine a world where the decisions you make are not your own, but are made for you by a machine. An AI machine that is programmed to know what's best for you, and has all the data it needs to make that decision. Sounds like a dystopian future, right? Well, it could be our reality sooner than we think.</p>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence has been a topic of discussion for a long time, but with recent advancements in technology, it is becoming more and more powerful. So much so that the CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman, has called for laws to regulate and mitigate the risks that come with increasingly powerful AI.</p>
   </section>
   <section id="examples">
    <h2>Quantifiable Examples</h2>
    <p>The risks of powerful AI are numerous, and some of them are already a reality. For example:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>The use of AI in decision=making processes, such as hiring or lending, can perpetuate existing biases and discrimination.</li>
     <li>Self=driving cars powered by AI are already on the roads, and accidents involving them have raised concerns about safety and liability.</li>
     <li>The use of deepfakes, which are manipulated videos or audios created using AI, can be used to spread propaganda or fake news.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These are just a few examples of the risks that come with powerful AI. As AI becomes more advanced, the risks will increase as well.</p>
    <p>According to a report by the World Economic Forum, AI could displace 75 million jobs by 2022. This could lead to increased inequality and social unrest.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Given the potential risks of powerful AI, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has called for laws that would mitigate these risks. Here are three takeaways from his call:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>AI has the potential to do a lot of good, but it also has the potential to do harm. Regulations are necessary to ensure that its development is guided by ethical principles and that it is used for the benefit of society.</li>
     <li>The risks of AI are not confined to the realm of science fiction. They are already a reality, and they will only increase as AI becomes more powerful. It is therefore important to act now, before it's too late.</li>
     <li>The development of AI should not be left to the tech industry alone. Governments, NGOs, and other stakeholders should be involved in the regulation and governance of AI.</li>
    </ol>
