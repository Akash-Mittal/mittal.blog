   <h2>Bringing the World Closer</h2>
   <p>It's hard to imagine waking up tomorrow without any access to the internet. With so many aspects of our lives moved online, from banking to healthcare, affordable and reliable internet access is more essential than ever. However, for millions of Americans, this isn't just a hypothetical scenario. Without the ability to connect, entire communities are left behind in an evermore digital world. Luckily, the <strong>WHAT THE TECH FCC program</strong> is providing free or discounted internet service to qualified applicants, helping bridge the digital divide and connect our communities.</p>
   <h2>Expanding Access in Underserved Communities</h2>
   <p>According to the <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2020/02/who-has-home-internet-access-in-the-united-states.html">U.S. Census Bureau</a>, more than 30% of households across the country lack a broadband internet connection. This is particularly pronounced in rural or low-income areas, where access to high-speed internet can be out of reach due to infrastructure or financial constraints. Without this essential connection, students struggle to complete homework, job seekers miss employment opportunities, and seniors are cut off from telehealth services.</p>

   <p>The good news is that programs like WHAT THE TECH FCC are working to bridge this gap. By providing free or discounted internet service to eligible families and individuals, these initiatives are expanding access and improving digital literacy. The FCC program, for example, offers up to $50 off monthly broadband bills for eligible households, as well as a one-time discount of up to $100 on a computer or tablet. For those who still lack access, the program has also partnered with hundreds of internet providers to offer free hotspot services in locations across the country.</p>
   <h2>The Benefits of Inclusivity</h2>
   <p>Aside from the individual benefits of affordable internet access, such initiatives provide a range of positive social outcomes. By offering expanded digital access and education, communities can decrease the gap between the rich and poor. This opens up increased opportunities for communication, economic success, and educational achievement. A report by the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/why-the-digital-divide-is-now-a-public-policy-priority/">Brookings Institution</a> found that bridging the digital divide can also lead to greater civic engagement and stronger community ties.</p>

   <p>Furthermore, affordable internet access also supports wider economic development. By providing increased opportunities for people to participate in online commerce, a greater number of small businesses can be established or grow. Telecommuting can also save on transportation expenses and free up more time for families and individual pursuits.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion: Connecting America through Affordable Internet Access</h2>
   <p>Overall, affordable and reliable internet access is a critical element of modern life. By expanding access and bridging the digital divide, we can create more inclusive communities and lead to increased success for individuals and long-term economic growth. Programs like the WHAT THE TECH FCC initiative are leading the way in improving digital access, and it's up to us as a society to champion these efforts.</p>
