    <h2>Fake Software Offering ChatGPT Based Tools</h2>
    <p>Recently, Facebook users have been targeted by a fake software that offers ChatGPT based tools. This software claims to improve the chat experience by providing AI-generated responses to conversations. However, it is actually a phishing scam that can compromise your personal information and infect your computer with a virus.</p>
    <p>According to cybersecurity experts, this fake software works by tricking users into logging into their Facebook account through a fake login page. Once the scammers have access to your account, they can steal your personal information and use it for identity theft or other malicious activities. Additionally, the software can infect your computer with malware, giving the scammers access to your files and sensitive data.</p>
    <p>It's important to note that ChatGPT is a legitimate tool that uses AI to generate responses to chat messages. However, scammers are taking advantage of its popularity to trick users into downloading fake software that can harm their devices and compromise their privacy.</p>
    <p>To protect yourself from this scam, it's important to be cautious when downloading any software or clicking on links that promise to improve your online experience. Always do your research and make sure that the software or website you are accessing is legitimate. Additionally, take the following steps to protect yourself:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Use strong, unique passwords for all your online accounts.</li>
     <li>Enable two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security to your accounts.</li>
     <li>Install antivirus software and keep it up to date.</li>
