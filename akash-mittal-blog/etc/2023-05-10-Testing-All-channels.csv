2023-05-10 23:30 PM;,"It was a cold, rainy night in San Francisco's Financial District, and I found myself wandering into a mysterious bar where all the drinks were named after tech CEOs. The bartender handed me the menu, and as I perused it I couldn't help but feel a bit uneasy. These cocktails had names like ""The Zuckerberg,"" ""The Gates,"" and ""The Musk,"" but they also had some sinister-sounding ingredients like bitter herbs, spicy peppers, and smoky scotch. I ordered a couple of them, and soon realized that these were not your average cocktails - they were potent, complex, and downright nasty. As I stumbled out of the bar, I couldn't help but wonder what kind of dark secrets these tech CEOs were hiding in their drinks.
When it comes to the tech world, we often hear stories of innovation, disruption, and success. But there's also a darker side to Silicon Valley, one filled with scandals, controversies, and egomaniacal CEOs. These nasty cocktails are inspired by some of the most notorious figures in tech, and they offer a glimpse into the twisted minds of those who rule the digital world. Here are 12 of the most vile and disturbing cocktails you'll ever encounter:
This cocktail is named after Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, and it's as bitter and divisive as the man himself. The main ingredient is Fernet-Branca, an Italian amaro that's known for its intense herbal flavor. The cocktail also includes grapefruit juice, which adds a sour note that balances out the bitterness. Finally, the drink is finished off with a splash of seltzer, which gives it a refreshing fizz. The Zuckerberg is a cocktail that you'll either love or hate, just like Mark Zuckerberg himself.
