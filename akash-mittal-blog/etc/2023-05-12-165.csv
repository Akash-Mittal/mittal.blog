Many people may think it's too late to have children in their 70s, but De Niro's experience proves otherwise. In fact, having children later in life can have its advantages. Here are some of the parenting wisdom that he has shared:
De Niro believes that as you get older, you realize how precious time is and how important it is to spend it wisely. He advises to make the most of the time you have with your children and to be present in their lives as much as possible.
One way to do this is by scheduling regular family activities that everyone can enjoy. This not only strengthens your relationship with your children but also provides them with memorable experiences that they will cherish forever.
