"2023-05-26 08:25 PM;","It was a hot summer day in Cape Town when I first heard of the NFT metaverse. As a digital artist, I was always intrigued by the possibilities of blockchain technology and its impact on the art world.
So, when I stumbled upon a tweet about a new NFT metaverse being developed in South Africa, I was curious. After doing some research, I discovered that the metaverse, called Afriverse, was a digital world where users could own and trade virtual real estate using NFTs.
Excited by the prospect of owning a piece of the virtual world, I decided to take the plunge and buy a plot of land in Afriverse. To my surprise, the value of my virtual real estate started to rise rapidly, and within a few weeks, I had made a significant profit.
South Africa's NFT metaverse and web 3 space have been experiencing exponential growth in recent months. Afriverse, the first NFT metaverse in the country, has seen a surge in demand for virtual real estate, with some plots selling for millions of rands.
In addition to Afriverse, several other NFT metaverses are being developed in South Africa, including Sunuverse, a digital world that aims to empower African creators, and Zimbae, a blockchain-powered social network for African artists.
