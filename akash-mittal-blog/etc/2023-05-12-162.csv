"2023-05-25 10:25 PM;","Robert De Niro is not only a legendary actor, but also a proud father of seven children. Despite his celebrity status, he takes his role as a father seriously and believes in the importance of old school parenting. In this article, we will explore some of the insights and tips he has shared over the years, and how they can help you be a better parent.
According to De Niro, old school parenting is about being consistent, firm, and loving. It's about setting boundaries, enforcing rules, and instilling values in your children. It's not about being their friend or trying to be cool. It's about being a parent first and foremost.
De Niro believes that old school parenting works because it teaches children respect, discipline, and responsibility. It helps them develop a strong sense of self and prepares them for the challenges of life. He also believes that it's important for parents to lead by example and show their children the right way to live.
One of the key aspects of old school parenting is discipline. De Niro believes that it's important to discipline children when they misbehave, but also to praise and reward them when they do well. He believes that children need to learn that there are consequences for their actions, and that they are responsible for their own behavior.
Overall, De Niro's philosophy of old school parenting is grounded in common sense and practicality. It's about doing what works, not what's trendy or popular.
