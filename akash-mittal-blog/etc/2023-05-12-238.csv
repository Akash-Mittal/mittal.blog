"2023-06-01 06:25 AM;","Google's ChatGPT has been one of the most talked-about technological innovations of recent times. It is an AI-powered chatbot that can engage in human-like conversations with users. However, Google's ChatGPT has a fierce rival in the form of Bard, an AI-powered chatbot developed by a small startup in Hong Kong. Bard had opened up to 180 countries, but then suddenly disappeared without a trace.
The mystery of Bard's disappearance has left the tech world baffled. Some believe that the founders of Bard may have sold their technology to a larger tech giant, while others think that Bard may have fallen victim to a cyber-attack. However, no concrete evidence has been found to support either theory.
As the mystery of Bard's disappearance deepens, tech enthusiasts around the world continue to speculate about its fate. Will Bard ever be found, or will it remain forever lost in the annals of technological history?
While the mystery of Bard's disappearance is yet to be solved, there are some quantifiable examples that attest to the popularity of AI-powered chatbots. According to a survey by Business Insider, 80% of businesses plan to have chatbots by 2020, up from just 10% in 2016. Additionally, AI-powered chatbots are expected to save businesses $8 billion per year by 2022.
Personal anecdotes also reveal the potential of AI-powered chatbots. One such example is from a major airline that replaced its traditional customer service with an AI-powered chatbot. The chatbot was able to answer 97% of all inquiries, resulting in a significant reduction in wait time for customers and reduced operating costs for the airline.
