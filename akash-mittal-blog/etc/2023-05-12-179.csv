In 2018, a tech startup based in Europe launched an AI-powered recruitment program aimed at reducing bias in the hiring process. The program was a success, and the startup secured several high-profile clients. However, a year later, the company faced a backlash following reports that the AI program was unable to distinguish between male and female candidates.
While the use of AI in various industries has helped organizations achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness, there are growing concerns about its impact on society. For instance, AI algorithms have been known to replicate biases from their training data, leading to discriminatory outcomes. That is why the European Union has taken steps to regulate AI, culminating in the recent AI Act.
The AI Act is a landmark legislation proposed by the European Commission to regulate the development and deployment of AI in the European Union. The legislation aims to promote the development of trustworthy AI by ensuring that AI systems are transparent, accountable, and respectful of human rights and democratic values.
The AI Act proposes a risk-based approach to AI regulation, with higher-risk AI systems subject to greater scrutiny and more stringent requirements. It also sets out obligations for AI providers, such as the creation of technical documentation, the establishment of human oversight, and the provision of clear information to users.
