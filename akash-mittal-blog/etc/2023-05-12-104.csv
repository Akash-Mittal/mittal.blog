"2023-05-21 02:25 AM;","Have you ever wanted to build an app but don't have the coding skills or time to do so? Well, ChatGPT promises to build an app for you in just 30 minutes! We were skeptical, but we decided to give it a try and see what it could do.
We started by going to the ChatGPT website and signing up for an account. Then, we were prompted to enter some basic information about the type of app we wanted to create. We chose a simple app to keep track of our daily water intake.
After entering our information, we were given a personalized URL to access our app. We clicked on it and were impressed with what we saw. The app had a simple, clean design and was easy to navigate.
