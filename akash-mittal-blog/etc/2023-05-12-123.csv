"2023-05-22 04:25 PM;","Imagine a world where autonomous killer robots roam the streets looking for any human to eliminate. Scary as it may sound, this is not far from becoming a reality. With the global arms race gaining momentum and the boom of artificial intelligence, the development of killer robots is becoming more attractive to military organizations.
In fact, some countries have already started working on their own killer robot projects, and experts warn that it's only a matter of time before we witness the first robot-on-human attack. So, what exactly is driving this trend and how can we prevent it from happening?
The development of autonomous weapons is not a new concept, but with the advancements in artificial intelligence, it has become a lucrative and strategic investment for many countries. In fact, according to a report by The New York Times, the number of countries investing in autonomous weapons has increased significantly in the past few years.
China, for example, has been vocal about its ambitions to become the world leader in AI technology and has been investing heavily in autonomous weapons. In 2017, the country tested its first unmanned tanks, and in 2020, it unveiled a new drone that can carry missiles and reach supersonic speeds.
Similarly, Russia has been developing its own autonomous weapons, including a robot tank and a drone that can take off and land vertically. Meanwhile, the United States has been working on a range of autonomous weapons, including self-driving trucks and unmanned naval vessels.
