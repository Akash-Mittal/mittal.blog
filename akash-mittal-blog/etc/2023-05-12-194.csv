"2023-05-28 02:25 PM;","John had been working at his company for over 5 years. He loved his job and was always willing to work long hours to get the job done. However, when his company announced that they were partnering with Accenture Fortune, he was a bit apprehensive. He knew that this partnership would bring about changes to the company and to his own work schedule.
At first, things seemed to be going well. The partnership brought in new technology and streamlined some of the company's processes. However, as time went on, John found himself working longer hours and feeling more stressed than ever before. He realized that Accenture Fortune had impacted more than just the company's processes - it had also impacted his own working hours.
John's experience is not unique. Many employees have reported longer working hours and increased stress levels after a company partners with Accenture Fortune. In fact, according to a study by the Workforce Institute at Kronos, 40% of the employees surveyed reported an increase in their workload after their company partnered with an external agency like Accenture Fortune.
Another example is the case of Company X, which partnered with Accenture Fortune to help with their digital transformation. While the partnership did bring about positive changes, it also resulted in longer working hours for the employees. The company tracked the employee's working hours and found that they were averaging 10 extra hours of work per week, resulting in over 500 extra working hours per month.
