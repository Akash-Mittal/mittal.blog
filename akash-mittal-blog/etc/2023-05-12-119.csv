"2023-05-22 08:25 AM;","Being a parent is a challenging and rewarding experience. However, when your children hit their teen years, it can feel like a battle just to get through the day. The emotions run high, the hormones are raging, and it seems like your once loving child has been replaced with someone you don't even recognize.
You may feel like you're walking on eggshells, trying to avoid a fight or argument at every turn. It can be exhausting and emotionally draining, leaving you wondering if you'll make it through this difficult time unscathed.
But fear not, there are ways to navigate this challenging time and come out the other side with your relationship with your child intact. Here are three tips to help you survive the battle years of parenting without emotional scars:
Communication is key when it comes to parenting teens. It's important to keep the lines of communication open and to be willing to listen to what your child has to say. While it may be tempting to lecture or criticize, try to approach conversations from a place of understanding and empathy.
One way to do this is to use ""I"" statements instead of ""you"" statements. For example, instead of saying ""You're so lazy, you never do anything around the house,"" try saying ""I feel overwhelmed when I have to do everything around the house. Can you help me out?"" This puts the focus on how you're feeling, rather than attacking your child.
