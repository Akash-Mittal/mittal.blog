But what if I told you that Wendy's is testing a new technology that could change the way you order food forever?
Wendy's is currently testing an AI chatbot that takes drive-thru orders. This chatbot uses natural language understanding and machine learning to understand what customers are saying and respond accordingly. The chatbot can take orders, ask follow-up questions, and provide information about menu items. In fact, during recent tests, the chatbot had an accuracy rate of over 90%.
One customer who used the chatbot during testing said, ""I was surprised at how well the chatbot understood what I was saying. It was almost like talking to a real person."" Another customer commented, ""The chatbot was able to answer all of my questions about the menu, and even made recommendations based on my preferences.""
There are several benefits of using an AI chatbot to take drive-thru orders. Here are just a few:
So, how can you take advantage of Wendy's AI chatbot? Currently, the chatbot is only available in select locations, but Wendy's plans to expand its use in the coming months. When you're at a participating restaurant, simply use the drive-thru and follow the prompts to place your order with the chatbot.
