"2023-05-27 06:25 PM;","John had always been a workaholic. He loved his job and spent most of his waking hours in the office, often neglecting his family and social life. But one day, he realized that he was burnt out and unhappy. He had no time to pursue his hobbies or spend time with his loved ones. That's when he decided to make some changes in his life and strive for work-life balance.
According to a survey by The McKinsey Global Institute, companies that promote work-life balance have a 25% lower turnover rate and a 20% increase in productivity.
Another study by the American Psychological Association revealed that employees who have a good work-life balance experience lower levels of stress and are more satisfied with their job, leading to better job performance and engagement.
Identify what's important in your life – family, work, hobbies, social life – and prioritize accordingly. Learn to say no to things that don't align with your priorities. This will help you manage your time more effectively and reduce stress.
Set boundaries between work and personal life. Create a clear separation between work hours and personal hours. Resist the urge to check emails or answer work calls during your personal time. This will help you recharge and avoid burnout.
