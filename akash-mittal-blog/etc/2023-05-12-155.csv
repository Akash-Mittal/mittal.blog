"2023-05-25 08:25 AM;","It was a typical Thursday afternoon when I picked up my 14-year-old niece from school. She greeted me with a disgruntled look, and when I asked her what was wrong, she sighed and said, ""I hate group projects. It's like I'm always the one doing all the work, and everyone else just sits there and texts on their phones.""
It got me thinking about the future she and her peers will face in the workforce. Collaboration is now more important than ever, but our kids are growing up in a world where instant messaging and texting are the primary forms of communication. How can we prepare them now for a workplace where chatting online is becoming the norm?
According to a recent study by Spiceworks, 60% of employees use instant messaging or chat apps at work. This trend is only expected to grow, with some experts predicting that chat-based interfaces will replace email as the primary communication tool in the workplace. Instant messaging is fast, it's efficient, and it allows workers to stay connected in real-time, regardless of location.
For kids growing up in this environment, chatting online is second nature. They use it to stay in touch with friends and family, and they're comfortable using a variety of messaging platforms. However, there's a big difference between casual chatting and professional communication. If we don't help our kids bridge that gap, they may struggle to communicate effectively in a work environment where chatting is the norm.
When I was in college, I took a course on business communication. One of the assignments was to write a professional email to a hypothetical boss. I thought I was pretty good at email, but when I got my grade back, I was shocked to see that I'd only scored a C. The reason? I'd used too many emojis. I was embarrassed, but I learned a valuable lesson. Communication in the workplace is very different from communication with friends, and it's important to know the difference.
