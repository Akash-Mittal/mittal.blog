The changes that India has witnessed have been phenomenal, and there are many quantifiable examples that prove the same.
Let me take you back to the year 2011, when India was a different place altogether. The country was grappling with corruption, poverty, illiteracy, and a plethora of other problems. India was not considered a preferred destination for investors, and many people were skeptical about doing business in the country. But things started to change with the new government that took over in 2014.
The new government brought in sweeping reforms and policies that aimed at transforming India into a global superpower. The focus was on economic growth, job creation, and infrastructure development. The government also launched several flagship programs such as Make in India, Digital India, Skill India, and Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, to name a few.
Fast forward to 2021, and the India we see today is vastly different from what it was a decade ago. India has emerged as the fastest-growing major economy in the world, surpassing even China. The country has attracted billions of dollars in foreign investments, and many multinational companies have set up shop in India. The government has also launched several initiatives to promote entrepreneurship, innovation, and start-ups.
There are many quantifiable examples that showcase India's transformation in the last decade:

Everyone was anxious to know how this would impact the Indian stock markets. The markets opened lower, but there was still some optimism that things would turn around. However, concerns about the Chinese economy added to the caution, and for the first hour of trading, the markets seemed uncertain.
The Indian stock markets have been volatile in recent times, with the pandemic, global economic uncertainty, and geopolitical tensions impacting investor sentiment. On 15th October 2021, the BSE Sensex was down by 371.87 points at 60,187.17. Meanwhile, the NSE Nifty50 was down by 96.45 points at 17,907.05.
According to a report in the Economic Times, global institutional investors sold Indian equities worth over $1 billion in the month of September 2021. The report noted that concerns over the pandemic and weak economic growth contributed to the sell-off.
The Indian Stock Markets: Navigating Uncertainty Amidst US Debt Deal Negotiations and China Economic Concerns
As a seasoned investor, I have learned that one of the most important things to do during times of market uncertainty is to stay on top of the news. This means keeping track of global economic and political developments, as well as monitoring trends in specific industries or companies.

This decision was based on several factors, including the country's large population, growing healthcare market, and favorable business environment. In this article, we explore the reasons why Omron chose India, along with some examples and personal anecdotes to illustrate our points.
Meet Rajesh. He's a 45-year-old man from a small village in India. Rajesh has been experiencing some health issues lately, including high blood pressure. However, due to the lack of medical facilities in his area, he has been unable to get his blood pressure checked regularly. This is a common problem in rural areas of India, where access to healthcare is limited.
This is where Omron comes in. The company has been manufacturing blood pressure monitors for over 50 years and is a leader in the industry. With its new factory in India, Omron hopes to make its blood pressure monitors more accessible to people like Rajesh. By producing the devices locally, Omron can offer them at a lower cost, making them more affordable for the local population.
The decision to set up a new factory in India was not a random one. Omron carefully considered various factors before making the decision. Here are some quantifiable examples:
These factors make India an attractive destination for companies looking to expand their operations in the healthcare sector.
