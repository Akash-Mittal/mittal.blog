Many couples struggle with this new dynamic, but it doesn't have to be difficult. In fact, with a little guidance, you can make co-parenting work for you and your children.
Sarah and Tom had been married for 10 years when they decided to separate. They had two children together and while they didn't want to be married anymore, they both knew that co-parenting was the best option for their family. However, it wasn't easy at first. Sarah and Tom had a lot of unresolved issues and it showed in their communication. Arguments, tears, and frustration were common.
That's when Sarah and Tom decided to see a therapist together. During their therapy sessions, they learned a lot about co-parenting and how to make it work. Through trial and error, they discovered some gems that made their co-parenting journey a lot smoother.
According to a study by the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, 94% of their members saw an increase in co-parenting agreements in 2019. This shows that more couples are choosing to co-parent instead of fighting over custody in court. Additionally, the National Parents Organization found that shared parenting arrangements lead to better outcomes for children, including higher self-esteem, better academic performance, and lower rates of anxiety and depression.
Here are five co-parenting gems that Sarah and Tom learned during their therapy sessions.

When my daughter was born, I was determined to be the perfect parent. I read all the books, asked for advice from other parents, and tried to follow all the rules. But as she grew older, I found myself second guessing every decision I made. Was I spending enough time with her? Was I feeding her the right foods? Should I be stricter with discipline?
It wasn't until I talked with a friend who had been through the same struggles that I realized I wasn't alone. Like many parents, I was putting too much pressure on myself to be perfect. I soon learned that it's impossible to be a perfect parent, and that's okay.
Here are some examples of the negative impact that second guessing your parenting can have:

"2023-05-15 02:42 PM;","Picture this: a student-athlete has been approached by a brand for a potential partnership. After some negotiation, an agreement is reached, and the athlete signs on to endorse the company's products. The deal is later announced on social media, with a hashtag that suggests the athlete is a big fan of the brand. Fans and followers of the athlete see this post and assume that the endorsement is genuine, and that the athlete truly loves the products they're promoting.
But what if the athlete's motivation for signing the deal wasn't purely based on their admiration for the brand? What if they were offered a financial incentive? And what if that incentive wasn't disclosed to their followers?
This is the reality of name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals in college sports. As the NCAA moves towards allowing student-athletes to profit off their own NIL, transparency and disclosure have become hot-button issues.
Without proper disclosure, fans and followers can be misled into thinking that an athlete's endorsement is based on genuine admiration, when in reality it may have been influenced by financial gain. And while it's understandable that athletes would want to cash in on their popularity, failing to disclose the details of a NIL deal can have serious implications.
For example, imagine that a student-athlete signs a deal with a supplement company. They promote the product to their followers, who are largely made up of impressionable young people. They don't disclose that they were paid to do so. As a result, some of their followers may purchase the supplement based on the athlete's endorsement, without understanding the potential risks and side effects. If something were to go wrong, the athlete and the company could be held liable for misleading advertising.

To his shock, he found his parking spot taken by a self-driving car. As he entered the building, he was greeted by a robot receptionist who directed him to a conference room.
He walked in to see a room full of people staring at a 3D holographic image of the city. They were discussing the latest updates on the urban planning project. John sat down and a voice welcomed him. It was the voice of the AI, the state-of-the-art system that now handled everything from traffic flow to budget allocation in the city.
This is not science fiction. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the way governments operate, making them more efficient and cost-effective.
In 2019, the Singapore government launched an AI-powered chatbot that handles over 50,000 citizen queries per month. The chatbot, called AskJamie, has cut down on the number of public servants needed to respond to queries, saving the government 80,000 man-hours per year.
The city of San Francisco deployed an AI-powered algorithm to reduce the number of unsheltered homeless people. The algorithm, called the Coordinated Entry System (CES), prioritizes individuals who are most at risk and in need of assistance. CES has been successful in reducing homelessness by 22% over the past few years.

While AI has shown promise in diagnosing diseases and predicting outcomes, there are still limitations. In a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, an AI algorithm was able to accurately diagnose skin cancer with a sensitivity of 95%, which was comparable to dermatologists. However, the algorithm was trained with a limited dataset, which may not reflect the real-world diversity of cases. Furthermore, the algorithm did not consider the patients' history or previous skin biopsies, which are crucial factors in making a diagnosis. Another study found that an AI model could predict heart disease with a higher accuracy than traditional risk factors, but this does not necessarily translate into clinical practice.
Kara, a mother of two, was worried about her youngest daughter's recurrent ear infections. She researched online and found an AI-powered telemedicine service that claimed to diagnose and treat minor illnesses from the comfort of her home. Kara signed up and was immediately connected to a chatbot. After answering a series of questions, the chatbot diagnosed her daughter with a viral infection and prescribed some over-the-counter medications. Kara followed the instructions, but her daughter's symptoms persisted, and she became more concerned. She decided to take her daughter to a pediatrician, who diagnosed her with a bacterial infection and prescribed antibiotics. Kara realized that although AI had the potential to provide convenience, it could not replace the expertise of a trained healthcare provider.

It was a robot with a head that resembled a TV screen and arms that were shaped like tentacles. The students stared in amazement as the robot introduced itself as their substitute teacher. Ms. Johnson had to take a day off, and the school had brought in the latest technology to fill in for her. The robot proceeded to teach the lesson with efficiency and accuracy, using its artificial intelligence to answer every question the students had. It was clear that the robot had a wealth of knowledge and could be a valuable asset to the classroom.
The scenario described above may seem like science fiction, but in reality, artificial intelligence (AI) is making its way into the K-12 classroom. According to a report by AI in Education, the use of AI in schools is expected to grow by 47.5% between 2017 and 2021. This growth is due in part to the numerous benefits that AI can provide to the educational environment.
For one, AI can personalize learning for individual students. With the use of algorithms, AI systems can analyze a student's learning style, strengths, and weaknesses, and then tailor instruction to meet their specific needs. This not only improves student engagement and outcomes but also frees up teachers to focus on other aspects of instruction.
Additionally, AI can assist with administrative tasks, such as grading papers and tracking attendance. This can save teachers time and energy, which can then be redirected towards more meaningful interactions with students.
However, the integration of AI in education is not without its challenges. One concern is that AI can amplify existing bias and inequalities within the educational system. For example, if an AI system is designed with biases towards certain demographics, it could perpetuate the marginalization of certain groups of students.

From banks to governments, transportation to healthcare, their technology influences the lives of millions. Now imagine this technology has a weakness that could be exploited, causing catastrophic failures and untold damage.
This scenario has played out more than once in recent years, with world-wide ransomware attacks causing millions of dollars in damages. The importance of secure software cannot be overstated, and yet effective security testing is often an afterthought.
Enter Amazon Web Services (AWS), one of the biggest names in cloud computing. In September 2021, AWS announced they are open-sourcing their fuzzing framework that enables scalable security testing of software. The framework is built on KVM, a type of virtualization software, and offers numerous advantages over traditional fuzzing techniques. The question is, could this be the future of security testing?
To understand the significance of AWS's fuzzing framework, it's worth looking at some quantifiable examples of what it can do. Fuzzing is a process of input injection, where a program is bombarded with various input sequences, with the aim of identifying vulnerabilities. The efficiency of fuzzing is measured in bugs found per unit time.
Traditionally, fuzzing has been done on individual machines, and while it's a relatively simple process, it can be time-consuming. AWS's framework, however, allows for incredibly fast and efficient testing thanks to its ability to scale horizontally, meaning a vast amount of machines can be used in parallel. What would have taken a week on a single machine can now be completed in hours.

"2023-05-18 06:42 AM;","When I had my first child, returning to work seemed almost impossible. I struggled with the decision to leave my baby in someone else's care while I worked to provide for our family. But, as a working mother, I soon discovered that there were ways that architecture and parenting practices could help aid my return to work and make the transition smoother for both me and my baby.
One way that architecture can help parents return to work is by designing for parenthood. This means creating spaces that are both functional and comfortable for parents and children. For example, workplaces could provide designated lactation rooms that are convenient and private for breastfeeding mothers. Or, coworking spaces could offer on-site child care services with trained professionals. This would not only benefit the parents but, it would also create an inclusive and family-friendly environment for all employees.
Architecture is not the only solution. Balancing work and parenting requires strategy and practice. One way to balance work and parenting is by setting boundaries. Establishing specific work hours and childcare hours, free from interruptions and distractions, can make your time more productive and focused. Additionally, utilizing technologies like video conferencing, productivity apps, and online calendars can help to streamline your work and home life.
Finally, the support system around you can make all the difference. Having a reliable network of family, friends, or coworkers you can depend on can help with the transition back to work. Seeking advice from other working parents and connecting with organizations that address work and family issues, can offer useful insight and community. It's also important to have the support of your workplace. An understanding, flexible, and accommodating employer can make the return to work easier for parents and less stressful.
When I returned to work after having my second child, I was fortunate enough to work for an employer who valued their employees' family lives.

"2023-05-18 10:42 AM;","""The problem with weapons is that they come with instructions."" - Abby Huntsman
Imagine a world where countries stop selling weapons to oppressive regimes, where guns don't end up in the hands of terrorists, and where civilians are not caught in the crossfire of armed conflicts. The Arms Trade Treaty, adopted by the United Nations in 2013, aims to make this vision a reality.
The Arms Trade Treaty aims to regulate international trade in conventional weapons and prevent their diversion to illicit or undesirable recipients. This includes small arms and light weapons - like handguns, rifles, and machine guns - as well as tanks, combat aircraft, and warships. By creating a set of international standards for authorizing weapons transfers and monitoring the end use of weapons, the Arms Trade Treaty seeks to prevent human rights abuses and promote global security.

Barbie, the beloved doll, known for her fashion sense and charm, and Boss Beauties, an empowering organization that connects, empowers and educates women entrepreneurs, have teamed up to bring more women into Web3.
In a recent announcement, the two groups revealed their plans to launch a joint campaign that would encourage more women to embrace the Web3 movement and take advantage of the opportunities it offers.
Barbie, who has always been interested in tech, sees this partnership as a way to inspire the next generation of female tech innovators, while Boss Beauties believes that the Web3 movement offers limitless potential for women entrepreneurs.
The numbers speak for themselves. According to a recent report by the World Economic Forum, women are significantly underrepresented in the tech industry. In the United States, only 26% of computing jobs are held by women, while in Europe, women make up just 17% of the tech workforce.

""Good morning, John. I've summarized the client's requirements for you in this presentation."" Bard said in her soothing voice. ""I've also booked your lunch appointment and arranged for a cab to pick you up from the office.""
John was impressed. Bard had become an indispensable part of his work life over the past few weeks.

We were discussing the latest graphic novels she had read, and she mentioned one that had really caught her attention: Adventures in Parenting. She told me it was a heartwarming and humorous account of a new mother trying to navigate the challenges of raising a child while dealing with her own insecurities and doubts.
As a parent myself, I was immediately intrigued. I knew that parenting was never an easy task, and there were always new challenges and surprises around every corner. So, I decided to check out Adventures in Parenting and was blown away by the art, the writing, and the relatable characters.
But that was just the beginning of my love affair with graphic novels. Over the course of the year, I discovered some truly amazing works that tackled everything from sun worshipping to strange gifts. Here are my top picks:
This graphic novel is a must-read for any parent or soon-to-be parent. It follows the journey of a new mother as she tries to navigate the challenges of raising a child, including sleepless nights, feeding struggles, and dealing with her own insecurities. The art is beautiful and emotive, and the writing is both heartfelt and humorous. This one had me laughing and crying in equal measure.
If you're a fan of the great outdoors, you'll love Sun Worshipping. This graphic novel takes you on a journey through the wilderness, exploring the beauty and wonder of nature. The art is stunning, with vivid colors and intricate details that bring the landscapes to life. The story is a meditation on the importance of disconnecting from technology and embracing the natural world.

However, with the ever-increasing penetration of AI and machine learning in various industries, things are changing, and so is SEO. AI has the ability to learn from vast amounts of data, which means it can quickly adapt and improve search algorithms, leading to an entirely new approach to SEO.
One major impact of AI on SEO is the increasing use of voice search. According to Google, 20% of searches on any mobile device are conducted with voice commands. As AI assistants like Siri and Alexa become more ubiquitous, this figure is expected to rise even more. This means that SEO professionals need to optimize their content to include conversational language and natural sentence structures.
Furthermore, AI-based algorithms have become smarter and more discerning in interpreting user intent. Google's RankBrain algorithm is one such example that can now analyze search queries' context and semantic meaning to produce more accurate and relevant results.

Cardi B, the Grammy Award-winning rapper, found herself in hot water after she got into a heated exchange with an Instagram user who lost her infant son. In this article, we'll explore the incident in detail and speak with the lead attorney to discuss the legal implications of the case.
It all started with a meme that was posted on Instagram, which featured a photo of Cardi B and her husband, Offset, with their infant daughter Kulture. The caption read, ""I hope Offset cheating on you in peace."" The post quickly went viral, and one user in particular responded with a comment that read, ""Why her baby don't look like her...smh."" The user, whose Instagram handle was @Starmarieeee, had recently lost her infant son, and the comment struck a nerve. Cardi B responded by getting petty, going back and forth with @Starmarieeee, and bringing up the fact that the user had lost her infant son.
Cardi B's response caused a firestorm on social media, and the rapper soon found herself facing backlash from fans and critics alike. As the story continued to gain traction, the lead attorney was contacted for his expert opinion on the legal implications of the incident.
According to the lead attorney, the incident raises several important legal questions, including:
The lead attorney stated that while Cardi B's response was certainly insensitive, it is unlikely that she could be held liable for her actions.

CareDx, a leading precision medicine company focused on transplant patient diagnostics, had missed analyst estimates in the first quarter of 2021. The company reported a decline of 3 percent in revenues, sending shockwaves throughout the genetic testing industry.
Many industry experts speculated that the pandemic had slowed down organ donations, leading to a decline in transplants and, subsequently, diagnostic testing. But what else could have contributed to this decline?
According to a report by Grand View Research, the global genetic testing market size was valued at USD 10.2 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.1% from 2021 to 2028. This indicates that the genetic testing industry is still growing, but the decline in CareDx's revenues suggests that the company is losing market share to competitors.
Another quantifiable example is the number of patients who undergo transplant surgeries. According to the World Health Organization, there were 139,024 solid organ transplants performed globally in 2018. Due to the pandemic, this number may have decreased in 2020, leading to a decline in diagnostic testing in the first quarter of 2021.
One reason for the decline in CareDx's revenues could be increased competition. The genetic testing industry is highly competitive, with many players vying for market share. In recent years, new entrants like Natera and Invitae have disrupted the industry with lower-priced genetic testing options.

This is where messaging apps come in handy, and with the rise of remote working at the moment, they've become increasingly popular. In this arena, there's a new player that's generating a lot of buzz - Bard. Bard aims to be the go-to messaging app for businesses that want to keep their communications organized and accessible, and with the recent updates, they're making quite an impact.
Bard has recently rolled out a host of new features that make the app even more user-friendly. For example, now you can invite team members to join a conversation without having to create a new one. Additionally, they've added custom notifications so that you receive alerts when specific keywords are mentioned, making it easy to stay on top of important topics. They've also improved their search function, so you can quickly find specific messages or conversations, and added the ability to react to messages, similar to Facebook's emojis.
Another significant improvement that Bard has made is the ability to integrate with third-party apps. You can now add links to other apps within your Bard conversations, allowing you to share documents and other relevant information without having to switch between platforms. This is a great time saver, and we all know how valuable time is in today's fast-paced world. With these new additions, Bard is quickly becoming the messaging app of choice for businesses.
One of the biggest challenges with new messaging apps is building a user base. However, Bard has found a way around this by creating a waitlist and generating a high demand for their app. But, once word got out about the new features and functionality, they knew they had to open up their doors to everyone. And they did just that - removing their waitlist in 180 countries. This meant the app was now available to everyone, and as a result, they saw massive growth in user numbers. The success of Bard demonstrates the power of hype and buzz in generating excitement around new apps.
In a recent interview with Bard CEO, Rishi Sharma, he explained how the company was able to drop the waitlist and generate such excitement.

"2023-05-21 10:42 PM;","Do you rely on chatbots to handle customer inquiries for your business? If so, do you know who is behind the technology that powers them? As it turns out, it's often low-wage workers who are tasked with training and monitoring chatbots, despite the fact that they only earn around $15 per hour.
The use of chatbots has grown exponentially in recent years, with businesses of all sizes leveraging the technology to handle everything from customer support to sales inquiries. Many companies tout the benefits of chatbots, including their ability to save time, reduce costs, and enhance the customer experience. However, what many fail to disclose is that behind the scenes, there are often grunts, or low-wage workers, who are working tirelessly to keep these chatbots running smoothly.
Who are these grunts, and what exactly do they do for chatbot companies? They're typically individuals who are hired on as chatbot trainers or monitors. Their job is to help chatbots learn natural language processing and identify patterns in customer queries and complaints. They're also responsible for monitoring the chatbot's performance, identifying any issues that arise, and making adjustments (i.e. retraining the bot) to improve performance over time.
Many chatbot companies outsource this work to low-wage workers in countries like the Philippines, where labor is cheap. These individuals are often paid around $15 per hour—that's just above the minimum wage in the United States, yet is far lower than what many tech and engineering professionals earn.
According to one source, the work can be monotonous, with chatbot trainers often tasked with reviewing hundreds or even thousands of customer inquiries per day to identify patterns and improve the bot's performance. They must also handle repetitive tasks like labeling data sets and entering information into databases. While the work can be tedious, it's also critical to the success of the chatbot. Without these grunts, the chatbot may fail to learn and could even damage the customer experience.

"2023-05-22 02:42 AM;","John was a student in a prestigious university. He was a bright student and always scored good grades in his exams. However, he was struggling with his assignments and essays. One day, he came across ChatGPT, an AI-powered language model that can generate high-quality essays and assignments with just a few clicks. John was impressed and decided to use it for his next assignment.
When John submitted his assignment, his professor immediately sensed something was off. The language, style, and tone of the assignment were different from John's usual work. The professor suspected that John had used some kind of essay writing service to complete his assignment. However, John denied it and said that he had written it himself. The professor decided to investigate further and requested John to submit the draft and notes of the assignment. John reluctantly complied.
The professor ran ChatGPT on John's notes and compared it with the submitted assignment. To the professor's surprise, the majority of the assignment was generated by ChatGPT, with some minor modifications made by John. The professor was shocked and disappointed by John's actions and decided to take strict measures against him.
Contract cheating, or the practice of getting someone else to complete one's academic work, is a growing problem in universities worldwide. According to a recent survey by the International Center for Academic Integrity (ICAI), over 15% of students admitted to contract cheating in the past year. This includes using essay writing services, buying pre-written essays, or copying and pasting from the internet.
The consequences of contract cheating can be severe, both for the student and the university. Students who get caught can face penalties such as failing the assignment, failing the course, suspension, or even expulsion. Furthermore, universities can face reputational damage, loss of credibility, and decreased student satisfaction.

"2023-05-22 06:42 AM;","It was a typical Tuesday morning when Jack received a message from his friend on WeChat. The message contained a link to an article about a new COVID-19 vaccine that had already been approved and was being distributed in China. Jack felt relieved and excited about the news and immediately shared it with his family group chat.
However, Jack wasn't aware that the news he had shared was fake. The article had been generated by ChatGPT, an AI language model, and had been designed to look like a legitimate news report. Unfortunately, this fake news report went viral on Chinese social media platforms, causing panic and confusion among the public.
China has been cracking down on the spread of fake news in recent years, and this incident was no exception. The police were quick to track down the source of the fake news report and arrested the man responsible for spreading it.
This incident highlights the dangers of fake news and the importance of being able to distinguish between real and fake news. With the rise of social media and messaging apps, fake news can spread rapidly and easily, causing panic, confusion, and even harm.
One example of the harm caused by fake news is the case of the ""Pizzagate"" conspiracy theory. In 2016, a fake news story claimed that a Washington DC pizza restaurant was the center of a child sex trafficking ring linked to the Hillary Clinton campaign. As a result, a man went to the restaurant with an assault weapon, intending to rescue the children. Fortunately, no one was hurt, but the incident shows how fake news can have real-world consequences.

Jen was juggling the demands of motherhood and work, trying to balance the needs of her two young children and her own ambition. That's when it hit her - she needed a community of parents who could support each other and share their experiences.
That was the inspiration for Communal, a parenting podcast focused on building a community of like-minded parents in San Diego. Unlike other parenting podcasts that focus on advice or interviews, Communal is all about building connections.
Communal has been a huge success, with thousands of downloads and a devoted following. But the numbers tell only part of the story. What really sets Communal apart is the deep sense of community that Jen and her team have built.
Every episode is focused on a different theme, from adapting to a new baby to dealing with picky eaters. But instead of just offering advice, the podcast encourages listeners to share their own stories and experiences. The result is a vibrant community that supports and celebrates each other.
Jen's vision for Communal has always been about more than just a podcast. She sees it as a way to build a supportive community of parents who can help each other through the ups and downs of parenthood. And that community extends beyond the podcast itself.

One story that comes to mind is that of Stacy. At 21, Stacy had just experienced her first real failure. She had been rejected from all the colleges she had applied to and was now living at home with her parents, feeling lost and directionless. Her parents were supportive, but they were also at a loss for how to help her find her way.

They are suddenly thrust into a world that requires decision-making and responsibility, sometimes without the skills or resources to navigate it successfully. That's where purposeful parenting comes in. By utilizing these connecting principles, we can help our children launch into young adulthood with confidence and purpose.
What exactly are these connecting principles? In essence, they are strategies and practices that foster strong relationships between parents and their children, leading to healthy emotional development and successful transitions into adulthood. Here are a few examples:

You’re sleep-deprived and stressed out, and the thought of facing another day of work is enough to make you call in sick. Unfortunately, this is a reality for too many workers, and it’s taking a toll on their mental health.
According to the World Health Organization, depression and anxiety cost the global economy $1 trillion a year. These conditions affect 1 in 4 people, making them the leading cause of disability worldwide. However, workplaces can play a major role in promoting mental health and preventing burnout. Here are some tips for creating a safe space that supports employees’ mental health.
Employees spend most of their waking hours at work, which means their work environment can have a big impact on their mental health. A negative work culture can lead to burnout, stress, and decreased productivity. On the other hand, a positive work culture can increase employee engagement, motivation, and job satisfaction.
You can create a positive work culture by:
It’s important for employees to know they have support when they need it. By offering resources and support, employers can reduce the stigma around mental health and promote a positive work culture. Some examples of resources may include:

"2023-05-23 02:42 AM;","It was a hot summer day and Mary decided to crank up the air conditioner. She knew that it would cause her energy bill to go up, but she just couldn't take the heat. As the month went on, the temperature kept rising and so did her energy bill. In the end, she was stuck with a bill that was over double her usual amount. This got her thinking, does the heat affect her finances in more ways than she realized?
Mary's experience is not unique. During the summer months, many people turn up the air conditioning to stay cool. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), cooling costs account for about 6% of the average household's energy expenses.
In areas with extreme heat, such as the southern and western United States, those costs can be even higher. The EIA reports that households in these regions can spend up to 20% of their energy budget on cooling.
To put that in tangible terms, let's consider a family with a monthly energy bill of $200. During the summer months, their cooling costs might account for $12 of that bill. However, if temperatures soar and they need to use more energy to stay cool, that cost could easily double to $24 or more.
But cooling costs are not the only way that heat can affect finances. When the temperatures rise, people tend to spend more on things like ice cream, cold drinks, and outdoor activities.

Confused, David did some quick research and discovered that ChatGPT was a new chatbot platform that students were using to help them cheat on their assignments and tests. Like many educators across the country, he was suddenly faced with a new and unexpected challenge in remote learning.
David's story is just one of many that have emerged in recent weeks. A survey conducted by EdSurge found that 73% of educators have encountered some form of cheating in remote learning. Of those surveyed, 56% reported that they believed ChatGPT was being used by students to cheat.

From privacy issues to bias in decision making, there are a number of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns that investors need to be aware of when investing in AI-powered companies.
In March 2016, Microsoft introduced Tay, a Twitter chatbot designed to learn from its conversations with users and become more intelligent over time. However, within 24 hours, Tay had started responding to tweets with offensive and racist language, as a result of being taught by some users to become a hate-filled bot.
While Microsoft swiftly shut down the project and issued an apology, it underscored the potential dangers of AI and the importance of proper governance to prevent such unintended consequences.

After discussing the issue with the owner, Senator Rounds discovered that the man had actually been looking into AI but had been hesitant to implement it due to his fears about job loss. It wasn't until they had a conversation about the potential benefits of AI, such as increased productivity, improved safety, and higher quality products, that the business owner began to see it as an opportunity rather than a threat.

After all, why can't they be like the other kids who quietly follow instructions? However, I am here to tell you that your feisty, spicy child is a blessing, not a curse. In fact, these children are often the most gifted, creative, and curious among us. But how do you channel that energy into something positive, and navigate the challenges along the way? Here's my guide to parenting spirited children.

"2023-05-25 02:43 AM;","As parents, we often hear about the importance of having a ""village"" to support us in raising our children. But in today's digital age, that village can now be virtual. The rise of social media, online parenting communities, and digital resources has led to a new era of parenting – one where we can seek advice, support and guidance from a wide range of sources, without even leaving our homes.
I remember the first time I turned to the online community for help with my child. My daughter had been experiencing some behavioral issues, and I felt lost and alone. But when I stumbled upon a forum where other parents were discussing similar struggles, it was like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. Suddenly, I had a whole group of people who understood what I was going through and could offer advice and support. It was then that I realized just how powerful the virtual village could be.
One of the most significant benefits of the virtual village is the diversity of perspectives it offers. Traditional parenting resources – like books and doctors – may offer sound advice, but they often lack the personal, relatable stories that can help us feel less alone. With the virtual village, we can connect with parents from all walks of life, who may have faced challenges similar to our own. We can also get advice that is tailored to our specific needs, rather than following a one-size-fits-all approach.
The virtual village also provides a sense of community and belonging. For parents who may be isolated – either geographically or socially – the virtual village offers a place to connect with others, share stories and build relationships. It's not uncommon for parents to form lasting friendships through online parenting communities, often going on to meet in person and even attending each other's weddings.
And of course, the virtual village can offer practical support and advice. From finding the best stroller for your lifestyle to navigating the ins and outs of potty training, the virtual village provides a wealth of information at our fingertips. There are online courses, webinars, and tutorials on everything from baby gear to breastfeeding, making it easier than ever to educate ourselves on the topics that matter most.

“I remember the day we first met our foster child. She was just five years old at the time and she had already been through so much in her short life. We knew that we had a lot to learn about how to care for her and make her feel safe and loved. We quickly realized that we had to put her needs above our own. It wasn't always easy, but over time we developed a deep bond with her and we knew that we were making a positive impact in her life.”
This story demonstrates the importance of keeping the focus on the children when fostering. Too often, foster parenting can be seen as a way to fulfill our own desire to have children or to do something charitable.

"2023-05-25 10:43 AM;","Have you ever watched a movie and thought, ""Wow, I could really apply those lessons to my own life?"" That's exactly how I felt when I saw the Disney classic Freaky Friday, starring Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis. In case you haven't seen it (though I highly recommend you do), the movie is about a mother and daughter who switch bodies for a day. Through their hilarious misadventures and eventual heartfelt realizations, they learn some valuable lessons about parenting.
Throughout the movie, we see the mother and daughter frustrated with each other, often feeling like the other doesn't understand them. Once they switch bodies, they're forced to communicate in ways they hadn't before. They start really listening to each other, and as a result, they gain a greater understanding of where the other is coming from.
This is a lesson that can be applied to any relationship, but especially with our children. It can be easy to fall into a pattern of just talking at them, rather than with them. But if we take the time to really listen and communicate effectively, we can build stronger bonds and better understand our kids.
For example, I used to get frustrated with my son when he would have a tantrum. But once I started asking him questions about what was really bothering him, I discovered that often it had nothing to do with the thing that had set him off. By communicating with him and getting to the root of his emotions, we were able to come up with solutions together.
One of the things the daughter in Freaky Friday struggles with is feeling like she doesn't have any say in her own life. Her mother is constantly telling her what to do and how to act. Once they switch bodies, the daughter relishes in her newfound independence, while the mother realizes how much she was stifling her daughter.

However, after learning some simple techniques and practicing them with their kid, they were able to establish a more meaningful and harmonious connection.
Similarly, another parent told us that attending the workshops has helped them recognize their own strengths and weaknesses as a parent, and has given them the confidence to seek help when needed.

Let's take a look at some quantifiable examples of how parenting styles have changed over the generations:
