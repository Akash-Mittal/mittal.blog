If you can't remember, or if you're still using ""password123"" or your pet's name as your password, you're not alone. Many people still use easily guessable passwords, and that's exactly what hackers are relying on to gain access to our sensitive information.
In 2017, Equifax suffered a massive data breach that exposed the personal information of 143 million people. The cause of the breach? A vulnerability in the company's website software that hackers were able to exploit using a simple password. The password in question was ""admin."" That's it. A single word that gave hackers access to sensitive information for millions of people.
Nowadays, hackers are becoming more sophisticated, using artificial intelligence (AI) to crack passwords faster than ever before. AI can analyze millions of passwords and identify patterns that can help hackers guess your password in seconds. That's why it's more important than ever to choose better passwords.
So, what makes a password ""better""? Here are some tips:
Remembering all these passwords can be tough, which is why it's a good idea to use a password manager. Password managers are apps that store all your passwords in one place, so you only have to remember one master password.

2023-05-29 08:46 PM;,"About two decades ago, Nvidia was known merely as a graphics company, producing high-end graphics cards for gamers and enthusiasts. Fast forward to today, and the company has transformed into a juggernaut of the artificial intelligence (AI) industry, with its technology powering some of the most advanced AI systems in the world. How did this happen? Let's dive into the story of Nvidia, the chip maker that became an AI superpower.
In the early 2000s, Nvidia started to shift its focus from being solely a graphics company to a provider of solutions for high-performance computing. It began producing graphics processing units (GPUs) that were not just good for gaming but also for scientific computing and data analysis. This move put Nvidia in a strong position to capitalize on the surging demand for computing power caused by the rise of AI.
Nvidia's GPUs are now the most popular choice for AI and machine learning (ML) researchers, with more than 60% of ML papers published at this year's top AI conference using Nvidia's technology.
The company's flagship GPU, the Nvidia Tesla V100, can perform 7.5 quadrillion floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) and has become the go-to choice for deep learning workloads.

2023-05-29 09:46 PM;,"Imagine you are a data center administrator working in a large corporation. Your job is to manage and store large amounts of data on your company's servers. One day, you are notified that you need to create a new file system to store a large video file. But the problem is that you do not have enough space on your hard drive to create a new partition without erasing some essential data. What would you do in this situation?
This is a classic example of a storage space management problem that people have been facing for years. The conventional method of managing disks was through the use of partitions. Partitioning hard drives enabled people to create separate spaces on the same disk and allocate files to them. However, partitioning did not solve the problem of disk utilization. People often ended up with unallocated space on their disks that could not be used for storing files.
Enter Logical Volume Management (LVM). LVM is a software technology that was developed to manage disk space in a flexible and efficient manner. With LVM, a hard disk can be divided into multiple Logical Volumes (LVs) that can be resized, combined, or even migrated to other physical disks without disrupting the storage operations. LVMs have made it possible to manage disk storage seamlessly, without the need to create partitions and manage data on them.
Storage Blocks are another innovation that has simplified file management. A Storage Block refers to a group of data that is stored and accessed as one unit. They can be thought of as a collection of data blocks that make up a file or a data structure. Storage Blocks have revolutionized how computers read and write files. They have made it possible to manage and store data efficiently and quickly. Modern file systems such as XFS, Btrfs, and ZFS all use Storage Blocks.
Now let us consider some quantifiable examples of how LVMs and Storage Blocks have transformed file management:

2023-05-30 09:46 AM;,"In the world of medicine, one of the biggest challenges facing scientists and researchers today is the rise of drug-resistant infections. These are infections that have evolved to become immune to traditional treatments, rendering many antibiotics useless. The consequences of this trend are dire, with an estimated 700,000 deaths each year due to these types of infections worldwide.
One story that illustrates the severity of this issue involves a young boy named Jack, who became ill with pneumonia at the age of five. Despite numerous rounds of antibiotics, Jack's condition continued to deteriorate, and he eventually lost his life to the disease. It was a heartbreaking loss for his family, and one that highlights the urgent need for new and effective treatments.
One promising avenue for combatting drug-resistant infections is the use of artificial intelligence (AI). By leveraging the power of machine learning algorithms, scientists are able to quickly analyze vast amounts of data and identify potential new drug candidates that might otherwise go overlooked.
In fact, just recently, a team of researchers from MIT used AI to discover a new antibiotic compound that shows promise in fighting drug-resistant bacteria. The compound, which has been named halicin after the fictional AI system from the movie ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" was able to eliminate a variety of bacterial strains in lab tests, including those that are typically resistant to traditional antibiotics.
What makes this discovery so exciting is that halicin was not initially identified as a potential antibiotic based on traditional screening methods. Instead, the researchers used a machine learning algorithm to analyze over 107 million chemical compounds and identify those with the potential to disrupt bacterial cell membranes. From there, they selected a small pool of candidates for further testing, ultimately landing on halicin as the most promising one.
