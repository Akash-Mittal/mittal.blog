"2023-06-02 04:18 AM;","Once upon a time, there was a young Muslim man named Yusuf who lived in a small village in Pakistan. Yusuf was a devout Muslim who prayed five times a day and fasted during Ramadan. He had always been taught that Islam was a religion of peace and tolerance, and that it was his duty to spread the message of Islam to others.
One day, Yusuf decided to travel to the nearby city of Lahore to attend a religious conference. As he listened to the speakers, he heard many different opinions about what it meant to be a good Muslim. Some speakers emphasized jihad, or holy war, as a way to defend Islam against its enemies. Others spoke about the importance of education and social justice, and how these were also essential aspects of the Islamic faith.
Yusuf was confused by all these different perspectives, and he began to wonder which one was the correct one. He realized that there were many cross currents in the Islamic world, and that it was not always easy to navigate these complexities.
One of the most obvious cross currents in the Islamic world is the tension between Sunni and Shia Muslims. According to the Pew Research Center, approximately 85% of Muslims around the world are Sunni, while 15% are Shia. This divide has led to centuries of conflict and even warfare in some parts of the world.
Another example of a cross current in the Islamic world is the clash between traditionalists and modernists. Some Muslims believe that the Quran and Hadith should be interpreted literally, while others believe that these texts should be understood in their historical context and adapted to modern times.

"2023-06-02 06:18 AM;","It was the summer of 2014, when Narendra Modi was announced as the Prime Minister of India. The nation was gripped with excitement and anticipation for the change that the new leader promised to bring. As a young Indian, I was caught up in the frenzy as well. But little did I know, that I was about to witness a leader who would not only bring change, but change the game altogether.
From the very beginning, PM Modi has been a game changer. He has brought reforms in various sectors, given priority to digitalization and technology, and made India a global leader. His work has been remarkable and has brought India to the forefront in the world stage. Here are some quantifiable examples on why PM Modi is the boss:
These are just a few examples of the many reforms that PM Modi has brought to India. His vision is not limited to just these projects. He has been a true visionary who has brought about major economic, social, and political changes in India. His approach, which is a combination of technology, innovation, and inclusiveness, has brought a new era of development in India.
Here are some more reasons why PM Modi is the boss:

"2023-06-02 08:18 AM;","London-based tech entrepreneur and investor, Stephen Kelly, fondly recalls his first trip to India in the late nineties. Kelly had just set up his own start-up for HR software, and he was keen to explore the Indian market for international expansion. He quickly realized that the Indian tech sector was vibrant and ripe with potential, but there were also many challenges. ""The infrastructure was poor, the bureaucracy was stifling, and corruption was rife,"" Kelly says. ""But despite all that, I was impressed by the entrepreneurial spirit, the thirst for knowledge, and the sheer energy of the Indian people. I knew that India was going to be a major player in the global tech scene.""
Fast forward to 2021, and India is indeed a major player in the global tech scene. It is the world's second-largest internet market, with over 687 million internet users. It ranks third globally in terms of the number of unicorns (start-ups valued at more than $1bn), after the US and China, with 38 unicorns as of January 2021. India has also emerged as a hub for research and development in cutting-edge fields such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and fintech.
Little wonder, then, that the UK government is keen to strengthen ties with India in the tech and innovation sectors. In April 2021, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a new Enhanced Trade Partnership (ETP) between the two countries, which includes a roadmap for closer collaboration on innovation and technology, as well as investment and trade.
There are several areas of opportunity for UK-India tech collaboration, according to a recent report by Frost & Sullivan. One of them is fintech, which has seen explosive growth in India in recent years. The report notes that the UK and India are both advanced in fintech innovation, and can learn from each other's strengths. For example, UK fintech firms could leverage the huge untapped market of underbanked and underserved customers in India, while Indian fintech firms could benefit from the UK's expertise in regulatory compliance and open banking.
Another area of opportunity is AI and machine learning, where India has made impressive strides in recent years. The report predicts that India's AI market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 27.1% from 2020 to 2025, driven by factors such as increasing adoption of cloud computing, big data analytics, and the Internet of Things (IoT). The UK, on the other hand, has a longstanding tradition of academic excellence in AI and machine learning, with world-class institutions such as Oxford, Cambridge, and Imperial College. Collaboration between UK and Indian researchers and start-ups in AI and machine learning could lead to breakthroughs in areas such as healthcare, agriculture, and transportation.
