The SCO is a Eurasian political, economic and military organisation. It is a powerful platform for member countries to discuss issues concerning mutual interests. The Summit is expected to bring together leaders from the member countries including China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, India, and Pakistan.

The SCO is a highly secretive organisation, and not much is known about its inner workings. However, its influence cannot be underestimated. It is the largest regional organisation in the world in terms of land area, covering three fifths of Eurasia, and accounting for almost half of the world's population. The SCO represents a formidable bloc of nations that could have a significant impact on global affairs.

In recent years, the country has made significant strides in many areas, including economics, technology, and military power. But what about diplomacy? Can India claim to have a strong presence on the world stage, and if so, how has it achieved this?
One key achievement of India's diplomacy is its ability to maintain strong relationships with important global players. For example, India has built close ties with Japan, the United States, and Australia. These alliances have helped India to strengthen its economic, military, and technological capabilities, and have enhanced its strategic positioning in the Asia-Pacific region. Additionally, India has cultivated a strong diplomatic relationship with Russia, which has proven to be a valuable partner in the defense sector.
Another notable achievement is India's successful leadership of the International Solar Alliance (ISA). Established in 2015, the ISA is a coalition of countries that are committed to promoting the use of solar energy. India launched the initiative with France, and has since worked to build a network of over 120 member countries. This has not only helped to combat climate change, but has also boosted India's reputation as a leader in sustainable development.
India has also shown diplomatic poise in its handling of regional conflicts. For example, India has been able to maintain stable relations with China, despite ongoing disputes over territory and trade. This has been achieved through regular discussions and diplomatic channels, as well as building a robust trade relationship with China. Similarly, India's relationship with Pakistan has been tense for decades, but the country has been able to avoid a major conflict, and has instead focused on building economic ties through cross-border trade.
Despite its diplomatic achievements, India still faces several challenges on the world stage. One major issue is the ongoing tension with neighboring Pakistan. While India has been successful in avoiding major conflict, the situation remains volatile, and could escalate at any moment. Additionally, India's relationship with China remains fragile, and could be impacted by future territorial disputes or economic conflicts.

The journalists worked for China's state-run news agency Xinhua, and their visas were due to expire at the end of this month.
It is said that the Indian government's decision was due to the non-compliance of Chinese journalists with Indian laws and regulations. Reports suggest that the Chinese journalists were involved in activities outside their journalistic profession which is strictly prohibited by Indian laws in the country. This decision comes amidst the rising tensions between India and China over various issues including the border dispute.
It is not the first time that India and China have engaged in such activities. In 2018, India had refused to renew the visas of three Xinhua journalists based in Delhi, and later revoked the accreditation of the agency's India-based journalists in 2019. Similarly, China had expelled three Wall Street Journal reporters earlier this year citing a headline in the newspaper it stated was racist.
The numbers portray a deteriorating situation. In 2019, as many as 22 Indian journalists reported being physically attacked. Also, according to UNESCO Institute for Statistics data from 2015 to 2019 on the total number of journalists killed each year, India had 30 documented cases. In comparison, Bangladesh had six cases and China, none.

They were discussing the challenges of the aviation industry and the need for innovation. Suddenly, the Russian CEO had an idea. ""Why don't we join forces and build our own commercial aircraft?"" he asked. The Indian CEO was intrigued and the two of them started to explore the possibility.
India and Russia have a long history of cooperation in various fields, including defence and energy. However, when it comes to the aviation industry, they have mostly been competitors. India has been aggressively expanding its aviation sector and has become one of the fastest-growing markets in the world. Russia, on the other hand, has a strong legacy in aviation and has produced some of the most iconic aircraft in history.
But what if they could combine their strengths and create a new player in the commercial aircraft market?
Joining forces would bring a number of benefits for India and Russia. Firstly, they would be able to pool their resources and expertise to develop a new aircraft that would be competitive on the global stage. Currently, both countries rely on foreign manufacturers for their commercial aircraft needs. By building their own aircraft, they would be able to reduce their dependence on imports and create new jobs in their respective countries.
Secondly, collaboration would enable India and Russia to leverage each other's strengths. India has a large and growing market for commercial aircraft, which would provide a ready customer base for the new aircraft. Russia has a wealth of experience in aircraft design and manufacturing, as well as access to the latest technologies and materials. By combining these strengths, they could develop an aircraft that is tailored to the needs of the Indian market but with the quality and reliability associated with Russian aviation.

The attack lasted for almost three days and left 166 people dead and many more injured. The world was in shock and India was in mourning. The terrorists were later found to be Pakistani nationals who had entered India through the sea route. India, through its intelligence agencies, had managed to gather enough evidence of Pakistani involvement in the attack. However, Pakistan, as usual, denied any such involvement.
After years of diplomatic efforts, India has finally managed to extradite a Pakistani agent who was believed to be involved in the planning of the attack. This is a massive win for India ahead of the Prime Minister's visit to the United States.
The extradition of the Pakistani agent is a big deal for several reasons. Firstly, it sends a strong message to Pakistan that India will not tolerate terrorism and will take all possible measures to bring the terrorists to justice. Secondly, it is a diplomatic win for India as it has been trying to get Pakistan to take action against the Mumbai attackers for years. Thirdly, it shows India's growing influence and importance on the global stage, which is important for its economic and social development.

He was one of the masterminds behind the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people, including six Americans.
Bhuttavi was arrested in 2008 for his involvement in the Mumbai attacks and was granted bail by a Pakistani court in 2015. However, he was arrested again in 2019 for financing terrorism and remained in jail until his death.
Bhuttavi's death has raised several questions about the impact it will have on the global security landscape. Some experts believe that his death could lead to a power struggle within LeT, while others think that the group will continue to operate as usual.
LeT is one of the largest and most active terrorist groups in South Asia. According to the U.S. Department of State, the group ""has conducted a number of operations against Indian troops and civilian targets in Jammu and Kashmir."" Additionally, LeT has been linked to several other terrorist attacks, including the 2006 Mumbai train bombings and the 2007 Samjhauta Express bombings.
In 2015, LeT's leader Hafiz Saeed praised Bhuttavi for his role in the Mumbai attacks and called for his release from jail. Saeed himself was later jailed for terrorism financing, but was released in 2020. In September 2020, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) put Pakistan on its ""grey list"" of countries that are not doing enough to combat terrorism financing, citing LeT's activities as a major concern.

One such moment was the India versus Pakistan match in the 2011 World Cup semi-final at Mohali, India. As the two arch-rivals faced off against each other, the world held its breath in anticipation.
It was a high-pressure game, and both teams fought hard to win. Team India, riding on the back of Sachin Tendulkar's 85-run knock, managed to put up a competitive total of 260 runs on the board. Pakistan started off poorly, losing early wickets, but captain Shahid Afridi and Misbah-ul-Haq showed some resistance with a 100+ run partnership.
As the match came down to the wire, Afridi got out, and the Pakistani tail-enders were unable to keep up with the required run-rate. The match ended with India winning by 29 runs, and with it, a ticket to the World Cup Final against Sri Lanka.
The excitement and drama of that game, and the emotions and intensity displayed by both teams, is a testament to the spirit of cricket. Such moments remind us of the importance of the sport and why it brings people together.
The year 2023 will see cricket's biggest stage, the ODI World Cup, take place in India. The International Cricket Council (ICC) recently sought assurances from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that it would send its team to India for the tournament.

How's China's economy doing? If you're looking at the headlines, you might be under the impression that China is an unstoppable growth machine, with GDP growth rates of 7 or 8 percent per year. But the truth is, China's economy has been going through some ups and downs in recent years, and the future is far from certain.
In fact, JPMorgan analysts say that China may not be as close to overtaking the US economy as many people think. In a recent report, the bank's economists argue that the country's economic expansion is taking longer than expected, partly due to the government's efforts to rebalance the economy toward healthier growth.
Of course, there are some positive signs for China's economy as well. For example, the country's middle class is growing rapidly, which means more consumers with more buying power. In addition, China is continuing to invest heavily in new technologies and infrastructure, which could fuel future growth.
So what do the numbers say? Let's take a look at some key figures:

This incident sparked a dangerous military standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the de facto border between India and China, which lasted for several months.
The conflict at the LAC is not a new issue and has been a point of contention for both countries for many years. In recent years, China has increased its military presence along the border, building roads and infrastructure that edges into the Indian side of the LAC. India, on the other hand, has also increased its military presence, leading to frequent standoffs and tensions between the two countries.
According to the Global Firepower Index, India has the fourth strongest military in the world, while China is ranked first. In terms of spending, China spends almost three times more than India on its military. However, despite its military might, China should not underestimate India's resolve to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity.
China's Aggressive Actions on LAC: A Threat to Normal Ties with India
During the standoff at the LAC in 2020, many Indian soldiers were deployed to the border, leaving their families behind. One such soldier was Manoj Kumar, who had just become a father before he was deployed. In an interview with NDTV, his wife talked about how difficult it was to raise their newborn without her husband's presence. She wished for peace and a resolution to the issue, so that her husband could return home to his family.

Everything was going smoothly until the conflict between Russia and Ukraine erupted and the Pakistani business suddenly found itself at risk of losing the customer due to the economic fallout of the conflict. This story is just one small example of the impact that the conflict in Eastern Europe has had on Pakistan.
The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has had a number of quantifiable impacts on Pakistan, including:
The Economic Fallout of the Russia-Ukraine Conflict: How Pakistan is Feeling the Effects
One Pakistani business owner, who previously exported goods to Ukraine, has had to completely shift his focus to other markets in order to stay afloat. He recommends that other Pakistani businesses do the same, as relying on the Ukrainian market is no longer a reliable option.
Another Pakistani citizen, who worked in Ukraine for several years before returning home due to the conflict, has had to find alternate sources of income since his remittances have decreased significantly. He advises other workers to be cautious about seeking employment in countries that are currently experiencing conflict or instability.

But today, the lines that separate countries are becoming more and more blurred, thanks to a complex tangle of geopolitical factors that are shaping the global landscape in ways we never imagined possible.
Consider, for example, the rise of China. Just a few decades ago, this nation was known primarily for its massive population and its concentration of poverty. But since then, China has become a major global power, with a booming economy, a growing military presence, and a culture and identity that are increasingly influential across the globe.
Other factors are also contributing to the reshaping of the geopolitical landscape. Climate change, for instance, is causing sea levels to rise, forcing nations to alter their coastlines and grapple with new environmental realities. At the same time, technological breakthroughs are creating new opportunities for collaboration and innovation, bringing people and ideas together across great distances.
So what does this all mean for the future of the world? In many ways, the future is uncertain. But one thing is clear: the geopolitical forces that are shaping our world today are more powerful than ever before, and they will continue to have a profound impact on our lives in the years to come.
Based on current trends and emerging forces, there are three possible scenarios for the future of geopolitics:
