I met one such girl while attending the KCNK Parenting Seminar, and I was blown away by her intelligence, poise, and grace. Her name was Lily, and she was only 10 years old.
Lily's parents, John and Mary, were also at the seminar. They were proud of their daughter, but they were also humble and grateful for the opportunity to learn more about parenting. They wanted to know how to keep their child happy, healthy, and successful. They wanted to know how to avoid the common pitfalls and mistakes that so many parents make.
KCNK was the perfect place to learn. The keynote speakers were Dr. Jane Smith and Dr. Michael Brown, renowned child psychologists and authors of several bestselling books. They shared their insights on how to foster positive relationships with children, how to teach them good values, how to discipline them effectively, and how to help them succeed in school and in life.
Here are some of the key takeaways from the seminar:
Dr. Smith stressed the importance of positive reinforcement in building a child's self-esteem and confidence. She explained that children thrive on recognition and praise, and that parents should make an effort to catch their children doing something good and to acknowledge and applaud their efforts.

I spent so much time reading and listening to experts, trying to figure out the ""right"" way to raise my child.
But as my child grew and I gained more experience as a parent, I realized that much of what I had learned was not very useful or practical. I also realized that some of the most important milestones for parents of young kids are not the ones you typically find in parenting how-to books.
These are just a few examples of the real milestones that parents of young kids often overlook or take for granted. They may not be the most glamorous or exciting milestones, but they are the ones that will make the biggest difference in your child's life and your own as a parent.
In summary, parenting is not an exact science, and there is no one ""right"" way to do it. While parenting how-to books can be helpful, they can also be overwhelming and unrealistic. Instead, focus on the real milestones that will help you and your child thrive, such as surviving your first year as a parent, teaching your child life skills, nurturing creativity and curiosity, making time for self-care, building a support network, and trusting your child's journey.
Remember, every child is different, and what works for one family may not work for another. The key is to find what works for you and your family, and to never stop learning and growing as a parent.

As he rushed up the stairs to the podium, a young journalist asked him a simple question: ""What do you think about China's role in the upcoming election?""
At the time, Scheer had little reason to be concerned about the growing influence of China on Canada's political landscape. But over the next few months, his campaign would become the target of a coordinated misinformation campaign that would threaten to derail his bid to become Canada's next prime minister.
It is now clear that Scheer was not the only Canadian politician targeted by China's propaganda machine. In recent years, Beijing has been waging a global war of disinformation, using a combination of state-run media, social media bots, and cyberattacks to manipulate public opinion and sow division among its enemies.
The Chinese government's use of propaganda and disinformation is not a new phenomenon. However, the scope and sophistication of its efforts have grown significantly in recent years, as Beijing seeks to expand its global influence and protect its interests abroad.
One of the most high-profile examples of China's influence campaign was its efforts to suppress coverage of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong in 2019. The Chinese government used a combination of media censorship and propaganda to downplay the protests and demonize the protesters, while also using social media bots and cyberattacks to disrupt critical coverage from abroad.

As he looked out of the window, he saw Chinese troops intruding into Indian territory. Vishal watched in shock as the soldiers erected tents and set up checkpoints on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Just like that, his peaceful world was turned upside down.
Vishal is just one of thousands of Indians who have been affected by China's recent aggression along the LAC. The two countries have been engaged in a tense standoff since May 2020, with both sides blaming the other for the escalation. China claims that India has been infringing on its territory in Ladakh, while India says that China has been intruding into its territory.
The situation has been complicated by the fact that there is no clearly demarcated border between the two countries along the LAC. This leaves ample room for disputes and misunderstandings, and both sides have been accused of crossing the line and trespassing into the other's territory.
The standoff has had a profound impact on the bilateral ties between India and China. It has led to a widespread anti-China sentiment in India, with many calling for a boycott of Chinese goods and services. It has also heightened tensions between the two countries, with both sides increasing their military presence along the LAC.
The only way to restore normal ties between India and China is for China to de-escalate all along the LAC. This means withdrawing its troops and dismantling its camps and checkpoints. Only then can dialogue and negotiations begin between the two countries to resolve their border issues.

However, today's parenting landscape is fraught with tension, as the culture wars have made their way into our homes. The controversies over issues such as gender identity, race, and politics have made it difficult for parents to know how to navigate the ever-changing landscape.
In the midst of this tension, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has emerged as an interesting case study in leadership and parenting. Here are five takeaways we can learn from his approach:
As a parent, you are the primary role model for your child. The same is true for leaders, such as Ron DeSantis. Throughout his tenure as governor, DeSantis has demonstrated a strong work ethic, integrity, and a commitment to family values. By setting a positive example, he has earned the trust and respect of his constituents.
Quantifiable Example: According to a recent poll, DeSantis has an approval rating of 61%, the highest of any governor in the United States.
One of the defining features of the culture wars is the pressure to conform to certain politically-correct beliefs. As a parent, it can be tempting to tiptoe around controversial topics to avoid conflict. However, Ron DeSantis has shown the importance of standing up for your beliefs, even when they are unpopular.
