"2023-05-26 04:25 PM;","Imagine you are a developer looking to build the next big thing on the blockchain. You spend weeks researching smart contracts and web3 technology, and finally, you sit down to start coding.
But, as you write your code, you start to notice inconsistencies and errors in some of the smart contract code you are using as a reference. You try to reach out to the authors, but they don't respond.
You are stuck, wasting time and feeling frustrated.
This is a common scenario for many developers in the blockchain space. And this is why the Smart Contract Registry Cookbook's recent $2 million funding round is so exciting.
The Smart Contract Registry Cookbook (SCRC) is a community-driven effort to create a comprehensive registry of high-quality smart contract code and developer tools.
