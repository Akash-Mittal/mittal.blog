"2023-05-26 12:25 PM;","Have you ever chatted with a chatbot and felt like you weren’t getting the help you needed? Maybe the responses felt too robotic or you were left feeling frustrated and without a solution. We’ve all been there. But what if chatbots could understand us the way a human would? That’s where Simplr’s new technology comes in.
Simplr, a customer service outsourcing platform, has recently unveiled their latest technology: Cognitive Paths. This technology is powered by ChatGPT, an AI-powered chatbot that can understand natural language and converse with customers in a human-like way.
Unlike traditional chatbots, Cognitive Paths allows customers to choose the conversation path they want. This means that customers can ask questions and give feedback in their own words, and ChatGPT will understand and respond accordingly. This technology provides a more personalized and efficient customer service experience, which leads to increased customer satisfaction and retention.
But how exactly does it work? Simplr’s ChatGPT platform uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand the intent behind customer messages. It can use algorithms to predict what the customer might be asking and generate a response that matches their request.
One of Simplr’s clients, a subscription-based e-commerce company, struggled with their customer service support during peak seasons. They had a high volume of incoming messages and didn’t have enough staff to handle them all. They implemented Cognitive Paths, and saw an immediate improvement in their customer satisfaction scores. Customers were happier with the personalized experience and were able to get the help they needed faster. The company was also able to handle the increased chat volume without needing to hire more staff.
