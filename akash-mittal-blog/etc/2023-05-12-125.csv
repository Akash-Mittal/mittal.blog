"2023-05-22 08:25 PM;","At first glance, Takuya Hirai appears to be a mild-mannered Japanese government official. But behind his unassuming façade lies a savvy politician who has marked himself out as one of the leading advocates for blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies globally.
In 2018, he was appointed as Special Advisor to the Prime Minister of Japan on FinTech and was later made Japan’s Minister of Digital Transformation in 2020. He has overseen a range of initiatives aimed at promoting innovation in areas such as blockchain, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.
But before he became a politician, Hirai was an entrepreneur who started his own software company and also ran a venture capital firm. He was also an early investor in Bitcoin, which he describes as a “collectible”.
“I first learned about Bitcoin in 2011, and I was intrigued by the idea of a decentralized currency,” Hirai said in an interview with Forkast.News. “I started reading everything I could about it, and I even bought some Bitcoin for myself. I saw it as an experiment, something that could potentially change the way we think about money.”
His interest in Bitcoin eventually led him to blockchain technology, which he believes has the potential to transform many industries.
