Have you ever dated someone who expected you to take care of them like a parent? Maybe they always asked you to cook for them, clean up after them, or pay their bills. Or perhaps they were emotionally needy, relying on you to constantly reassure them, fix their problems, and listen to their complaints.
That's what happened to my friend Sara. She met a guy named Matt who seemed charming and fun at first. But after a few weeks of dating, she realized that he was a man child. He couldn't take care of himself, let alone contribute to a healthy relationship. She ended up feeling drained, frustrated, and resentful.
But instead of giving up on dating altogether, Sara decided to embrace a new trend that's gaining popularity among women who are tired of coddling grown men. It's called Not Soft Parenting a Man Child, and it's all about setting boundaries, holding men accountable, and prioritizing your own needs.
To understand this trend better, let's look at some quantifiable examples:
