It was a lazy Sunday afternoon, and my friend and I decided to kill time by playing a game on ChatGPT. We chose the "Rivals" option, which supposedly matched you with an opponent of similar verbal skills. As the game progressed, it became clear that my opponent wasn't just focused on winning. They were intentionally trying to make me angry by commenting on my moves, my intelligence and even my appearance. At first, I found it funny, but soon I realized that I was getting emotionally affected by their comments. I ended up losing the game and feeling frustrated.
