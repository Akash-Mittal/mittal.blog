When they received the mattress, they were impressed by the quality and attention to detail. It was clear that Naturepedic took their mission of creating safe and healthy sleep products seriously. Sarah and Mark slept soundly at night, knowing that their baby was sleeping on a mattress that was free from harmful chemicals and materials.
Fast forward to a few years later, and Sarah and Mark are still loyal customers of Naturepedic. They were thrilled to hear that Naturepedic has been named a winner of two 2023 Best for Mom National Parenting Products Awards (NAPPA)!
The first award-winning product is Naturepedic's Organic Cotton Crib Mattress, which is designed for infants and toddlers. Made with certified organic cotton and a non-toxic waterproof coating, this crib mattress provides a safe and healthy sleep environment for babies.
The second award-winning product is Naturepedic's Organic Breathable Ultra Crib Mattress, which features a breathable surface that allows for increased airflow and reduced suffocation risk. It is also made with certified organic cotton and a non-toxic waterproof coating.
