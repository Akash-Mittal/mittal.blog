"2023-05-20 10:25 PM;","Have you ever wondered how chatbots work? It's fascinating how they seem to understand every question we ask them. The story of how a chatbot disrupted the world of customer service is quite intriguing. But with the advancement of AI technology, we need to look beyond chatbots and focus on the bigger picture of how AI is changing the business landscape.
In the past few years, AI has been the most significant disruptor of the tech industry. It has brought revolutionary changes in different sectors such as healthcare, finance, marketing, and others. But with all these changes, one common denominator remains - data.
As more businesses adopt AI, there is an increasing need for trusted, governed data to support AI models. In this article, we look at how AI's evolving vision renews the need for trusted, governed data and why it's essential for businesses.
AI algorithms require large amounts of data that are both diverse and high-quality. Without quality data, the algorithms may produce inaccurate results, support biased decision-making, and be unreliable.
This is where trusted, governed data comes in. It refers to data that is managed and secured based on specific policies, standards, and regulations. It involves ensuring that data is complete, accurate, and consistent, and that there is appropriate access control and data protection.
