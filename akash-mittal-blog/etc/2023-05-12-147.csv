"2023-05-24 04:25 PM;","OKX Web3 Earn, a digital asset investment platform, has recently announced the integration of CertiK's Skynet Security Score into its platform. This move comes after the platform was targeted by hackers who managed to steal a considerable amount of digital assets from its users.
The team at OKX Web3 Earn realized that security is of utmost importance in the digital asset space and that they needed to take concrete steps to ensure that their users' assets are always safe. They went in search of a reliable solution and found CertiK's Skynet Security Score, which is a cutting-edge security assessment tool that uses advanced data analytics, machine learning, and blockchain technology to assess the security posture of digital assets.
With Skynet Security Score, the team at OKX Web3 Earn can now gain valuable insights into the security of their platform and improve it proactively. They can also provide their users with a transparent assessment of the security of their digital assets, which can help build trust and increase user adoption.
Skynet Security Score uses a proprietary algorithm to assess the security posture of a digital asset. The algorithm takes into account various parameters such as smart contract vulnerabilities, code vulnerabilities, governance model, and historical security events.
Let's take the example of a stablecoin. Skynet Security Score would evaluate the smart contract code of the stablecoin and check for any vulnerabilities. It would also evaluate the governance model of the stablecoin and check if it has any centralized points of failure. Based on these factors and others, Skynet Security Score would assign a score to the stablecoin, which would range from 0 to 100.
