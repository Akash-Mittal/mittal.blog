"2023-05-26 06:25 AM;","It was a chaotic scene outside the Marlborough public schools on Monday morning when dozens of parents and students were left stranded by a school bus driver strike. The strike was called by the drivers' union to demand higher pay and better working conditions, leaving school administrators scrambling to find alternative transportation for the affected students.
Marie Johnson has been a school bus driver in Marlborough for over 10 years. She says that the decision to go on strike was not an easy one, but it was necessary to bring attention to the issues facing drivers.
Marie says that she and her fellow drivers are relieved that the strike has come to an end, but they are still pushing for better pay and working conditions from the school district.
