Once upon a time, there was a small town that had only one grocery store. The store had a monopoly and the people had no choice but to buy their goods at high prices. One day, a new grocery store opened in town and offered lower prices and better quality products. The monopoly grocery store lost its customers and eventually went out of business. This is a classic case of competitive advantage.

The other day, my friend Tom received a message on his ChatGPT account. It was from a stranger - a woman with a gorgeous profile picture and a message that said "Hey, Tom. I am particularly interested in you, do you want to chat?". Tom, being the nice guy that he is, replied and they started to chat. However, something didn't feel right. The stranger seemed off-topic and kept insisting that Tom should click on a link that was sent to him. Tom hesitated for a moment but eventually clicked on it. And that was when the trouble started. His computer was infected with malware that caused him to lose data and access to his ChatGPT account.
