When you're a CEO or a business leader in today's world, talking about AI is almost inescapable. Almost every industry is being impacted by AI in some way or the other, and companies are having to adapt to stay relevant. However, talking about AI is not always easy, and it can be particularly challenging with shareholders and stakeholders who might not be as familiar with the technology as you are.
Let me illustrate this with a story.
Not too long ago, a CEO of a large financial services firm was doing a presentation on how his company was incorporating AI into their operations. Everything was going well until he started throwing around technical jargon and using buzzwords that nobody understood. It was clear that he was excited about AI, but it wasn't clear how it was going to benefit the company, or even why they were investing in it in the first place.
The shareholders became nervous and confused and started asking tough questions, such as, ""what's the ROI on this investment?"", ""how will it impact our bottom line?"", ""what's the timeline for implementation?"". Unfortunately, the CEO did not have the answers, and the presentation ended up causing more harm than good. The investors left feeling unconvinced and suspicious of the company's management.
