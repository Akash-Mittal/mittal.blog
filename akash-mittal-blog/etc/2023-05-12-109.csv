"2023-05-21 12:25 PM;","It was the night before a big marketing campaign presentation, and Sarah had hit a wall. She had spent weeks coming up with the perfect message and visuals to promote the new sports drink, but nothing seemed to be clicking. As she sat at her desk, staring at her computer screen, she wondered if she should just give up and present what she had, even though she knew it wasn't good enough.
Just then, her coworker Josh walked in and saw the look of defeat on her face. He asked her what was wrong, and she explained her problem. ""Why don't you try using a generative AI tool to come up with some ideas?"" he suggested.
Sarah had heard of generative AI before, but she had never used it in her work. However, she was desperate enough to give it a try, so she downloaded a tool that promised to generate marketing ideas based on user input.
Within minutes, Sarah was amazed at the ideas the tool was generating. They were unique, creative, and perfect for the sports drink campaign. She quickly jotted down some of her favorites and presented them the next day. Her boss was impressed, and the campaign was a huge success.
This is just one example of how generative AI is changing creativity. In the past, creatives like Sarah would have had to rely on their own ideas and instincts to come up with solutions to creative challenges. But now, with the help of generative AI, they can tap into a whole new realm of possibilities.
