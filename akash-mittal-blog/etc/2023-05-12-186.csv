Imagine it's the early 1900s and you're riding in a horse carriage down a dirt road. Suddenly, you see a car zoom past you, making a loud noise and emitting a foul smell. You shake your head and scoff at the thought of this new technology ever replacing the majestic animal pulling your carriage.
Fast forward to present day, and we're on the cusp of a similar transition, but this time it's not cars replacing horses â€“ it's AI replacing humans.
AI is no longer a pie-in-the-sky concept relegated to sci-fi movies and university research labs. It's here, and it's transforming the way we live and work. AI-first companies, such as Google and Facebook, are leading the charge by incorporating machine learning and natural language processing into their products.
Even traditional industries, such as healthcare, finance, and transportation, are embracing AI in order to increase efficiency and reduce costs. For example, IBM Watson is being used to assist doctors in diagnosing patients, while Uber is investing heavily in self-driving cars to replace human drivers.
