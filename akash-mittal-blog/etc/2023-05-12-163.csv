"2023-05-26 12:25 AM;","As a parent, there’s nothing that can prepare you for the wild ride of raising children. The journey is exciting and scary all at the same time. Such is the sentiment of Hollywood icon and seven-time dad, Robert De Niro.
I had the pleasure of sitting down with the legend himself to discuss his experiences with parenthood and the ups and downs that come with it. De Niro shared that even with all the fame and fortune, being a parent is one of the greatest challenges he’s ever faced.
De Niro recalled an event that happened when he was raising his second child, Elliot, with his wife at the time, Diahnne Abbott.
“One of the most memorable experiences I’ve had as a father was when Elliot was born. I remember holding him in my arms for the first time and feeling a sense of responsibility that I’d never felt before,” he recounted. “That was when I realized that being a parent is not something to be taken lightly.”
De Niro acknowledges that everyone’s parenting experience is different, but he shares some quantifiable examples of the challenges he and his family have faced over the years.
