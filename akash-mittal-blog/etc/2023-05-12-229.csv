"2023-05-31 12:25 PM;","It was a humid day in June, 2021, when a small group of animal rights activists gathered outside the Supreme Court, holding signs that read ""Protect Our Pigs"" and ""End Animal Cruelty Now"". They had come to witness a historic moment: the verdict on California's pig welfare law. This law, passed in 2018, required that all pigs raised for meat in California must have enough space to lie down, stand up, turn around, and fully extend their limbs. It also prohibited the sale of pork from animals that were confined in cruel gestation crates.
The law was challenged by the National Pork Producers Council, who argued that it was unconstitutional and would cause undue financial burden on the industry. The case reached the Supreme Court, where it was closely watched by animal welfare advocates and industry stakeholders alike.
On the day of the verdict, tension was high. The court was divided, with four liberal justices and three conservative justices on each side. The deciding vote was Justice Robert H. Jackson, who had previously been seen as a reliable conservative vote.
As Justice Jackson delivered his opinion from the bench, the activists outside held their breath. ""Although I may not agree with the policy decisions reflected in California's law, it is not the role of this Court to overturn them,"" he said. ""The law does not clearly violate the Commerce Clause, and the state has a legitimate interest in protecting animal welfare.""
The activists erupted in cheers, hugging each other and raising their signs triumphantly. It was a victory for pig welfare, and for the millions of animals who suffer in factory farms every year.
