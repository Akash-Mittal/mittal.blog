"2023-05-22 04:25 AM;","Have you ever wished you could have a personal assistant to write your emails for you? Well, now you can with Google's new AI tool!
Google's AI tool, known as ""Smart Compose,"" uses machine learning to suggest phrases and sentences in real-time as you type your emails. This means that you can write your emails faster and more efficiently than ever before.
For example, if you start typing ""Hey Jane,"" Smart Compose may suggest ""Hey Jane, how are you doing today?"" instead of forcing you to come up with a greeting from scratch. Smart Compose also takes into account the context of your email, such as the subject line and any previous emails in the thread, to make its suggestions more relevant.
Using Smart Compose is easy and only requires a few simple steps.
You can also disable Smart Compose at any time by following the same steps and unchecking the box for ""Writing suggestions on.""
