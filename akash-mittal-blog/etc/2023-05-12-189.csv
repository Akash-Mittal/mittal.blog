"2023-05-28 04:25 AM;","During his keynote speech at the GIC Bridge Forum in San Francisco, DPM Heng Swee Keat shared his insights and vision for the future of innovation. As one of the most forward-thinking leaders in Singapore's government, DPM Heng's ideas can provide valuable guidance for entrepreneurs and innovators alike.
Before diving into the specifics of his speech, DPM Heng shared a story from his own experience. He recalled a time when he was traveling in a remote area of China, and saw a group of people watching a movie on their mobile phones. This simple scene impressed upon him the power of innovation, and its ability to bring people together, no matter where they are in the world.
Throughout his speech, DPM Heng shared a number of quantifiable examples to highlight the importance of innovation, both for Singapore and the world at large. For example, he noted that Singapore has consistently ranked among the top countries in the world for ease of doing business, thanks in large part to our efforts to create an environment that is conducive to innovation. He also highlighted the fact that Singapore spends a higher proportion of our GDP on research and development than most other countries, demonstrating our commitment to innovation as a national priority.
The future of innovation is not just about creating new technologies, however. As DPM Heng emphasized in his speech, it is also about creating a culture where innovation can thrive. That's why his call to action was so powerful: ""Let us work together to create a culture of innovation that is not just about technology, but about people and ideas.""
To illustrate his point about the importance of creating a culture of innovation, DPM Heng shared a personal anecdote about his own experience in the civil service. He explained that when he was first starting out, he worked in a government department where failure was seen as something to be avoided at all costs. But when he moved to the Monetary Authority of Singapore, he found a completely different culture - one that was more willing to take risks and try new things. This experience taught him the value of creating an environment that encourages creativity and experimentation.
