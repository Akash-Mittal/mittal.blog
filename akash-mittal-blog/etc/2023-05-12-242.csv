"2023-06-01 02:25 PM;","Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck's relationship has been making headlines ever since they were spotted together earlier this year. But while JLo may be one of the most famous women in the world, there's one thing she envies about her rekindled romance with Ben: his fans.
Ben Affleck has a loyal following of fans who have been supporting him for years. Whether it's through his movies, his activism, or his personal life, Ben has a devoted fanbase that stays up-to-date with his every move. This is thanks, in part, to sites like FandomWire, which provides the latest news and gossip about their favorite celebrities.
The power of fandom is a force to be reckoned with. Fans can make or break a celebrity's career, and they can also influence their personal life. In the case of Ben and Jen, it seems that their fans played a role in bringing them back together. As news of their relationship started to circulate, fans were thrilled at the prospect of Bennifer 2.0. And now that they're officially back together, their fans are more supportive than ever.
While Jennifer Lopez certainly has her own fans, there's something different about Ben's following. His fans seem to be more loyal, more vocal, and more invested in his life. This isn't to say that JLo isn't loved, but she may not have the same level of dedication from her fans as Ben does.
Perhaps this is why JLo envies Ben's FandomWire. She sees the love and support that Ben receives from his fans, and she wants that too. It's not that she wants to take anything away from Ben - she just wants to be loved as deeply and as passionately as he is.
