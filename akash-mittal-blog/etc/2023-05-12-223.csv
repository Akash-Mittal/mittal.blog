"2023-05-31 12:25 AM;","As a mother to two elementary school children, I have come to realize the impact of Covid-19 on my children's social skills. After months of remote learning and social distancing, both of my kids were struggling to communicate with their peers and engage in social activities. Seeing them struggle with the simplest social interactions made me realize that I needed to help them develop their social skills.
Covid-19 pandemic has brought drastic changes in our daily lives, including an increasing reliance on technology and social isolation. For many children, the impact can be seen in different ways, such as difficulty in communication, emotional regulation, and physical activity.
A study conducted by the American Psychological Association (APA) found that the pandemic has affected the cognitive and emotional development of children. The study also found that children who had access to reliable and supportive parents performed better in terms of social and emotional development.
Social skills refer to the ability to communicate and interact effectively with others. These skills are essential for building healthy relationships, managing emotions, and succeeding in all areas of life. For children, social skills are especially crucial for academic success and mental health
Children with strong social skills are more likely to perform better academically, have a positive attitude, and establish meaningful relationships. They are also more resilient, better able to manage stress, and have a lower risk of developing mental health issues.
