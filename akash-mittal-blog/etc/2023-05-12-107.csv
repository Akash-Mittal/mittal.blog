"2023-05-21 08:25 AM;","Once upon a time, a financial services company decided to implement an artificial intelligence (AI) system to automate their customer service process. The company had high hopes that AI would help them reduce costs, improve customer satisfaction, and increase revenue. However, after a few months of using the system, they noticed something alarming: their AI usage costs were skyrocketing, and they had no way of measuring or tracking them.
This is a common problem for organizations that use AI. While AI has the potential to save companies millions of dollars in labor costs, it can also be extremely expensive to maintain and operate. That's why Datadog, a cloud monitoring platform, has teamed up with OpenAI ChatGPT to help organizations monitor their AI usage costs.
To understand how Datadog and OpenAI ChatGPT work together to help organizations monitor AI usage costs, let's take a closer look at each platform.
Datadog is a cloud monitoring platform that provides real-time insights into an organization's cloud infrastructure, applications, and logs. Datadog can monitor over 450 integrations, including AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Kubernetes, and provides a unified view of an organization's entire cloud environment. With Datadog, organizations can set up alerts, create custom dashboards, and analyze data to gain insights into their cloud environment.
OpenAI ChatGPT is an AI model developed by OpenAI that can generate human-like text. ChatGPT has been trained on a large corpus of text and can answer questions, generate text, and be used for a variety of applications. For example, ChatGPT can be used for customer service chatbots, language translation, and content generation.
