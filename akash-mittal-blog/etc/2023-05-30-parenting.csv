"2023-06-02 04:31 AM;","A few months ago, Suzy's 10-year-old daughter came to her with a plea for a cell phone. ""All my friends have one, Mom,"" she said. ""I'm the only one without."" Suzy had been dreading this conversation, as she knew all too well the challenges of parenting in the digital age. Between online predators, cyberbullying, and screen addiction, she worried about the dangers lurking in her daughter's phone. But she also knew that technology was a necessary part of modern life, and that she couldn't keep her daughter in a bubble forever. So, after much discussion and negotiation, Suzy agreed to get her daughter a phone, with strict rules and monitoring.
Suzy's story is not unique. Parenting in the age of technology is full of challenges and demands, from the youngest children who are exposed to screens from birth, to the teenagers who are navigating social media and online relationships. In this article, we will explore some of the technology challenges facing parents today, and offer tips for navigating the digital landscape.
Technology has brought many wonderful advancements to our lives, from smartphones to smart homes, from social media to online education. However, with these advancements come new challenges and concerns for parents.
One of the biggest concerns for parents in the digital age is the safety and security of their children online. The internet is full of potential dangers, from cyberbullying and online predators to scams and viruses. Parents need to be aware of these risks and take steps to protect their children.

"2023-06-02 06:31 AM;","June is commonly celebrated as Pride month in honor of the LGBTQ+ community. While many of us look forward to colorful parades and events during Pride month, it's also an essential time to instill important values in our children regarding love, diversity, and acceptance. As a parent, you have the power to influence your child's perceptions and attitudes. So, it's critical to take advantage of this time to actively teach your kids about the LGBTQ+ community and create a safe space for all kids.
When my son, Tom, was six years old, we went to the park and saw a family with two moms. Tom curiously asked me, ""Mommy, why does that family look a little different than ours?"". I seized the moment and explained to him how families could have different structures. I explained to him that some families have two moms or dads, and it's essential to respect everyone, no matter how they look or who they love. Since then, our family's conversations around Pride month and diversity have become more rigorous and educated.
How to raise an accepting child in the month of Pride: The Essential Guide
Recently, a family friend shared a story with me about how she had used Pride month to explain to her five-year-old child how gender worked. Her child had always been curious about how people decided whether they were boys or girls, and her friend decided it was high time she explained it to her. Together, they discussed different labels and how they applied. The child was surprised to learn that sex organs don't identify gender, and that she could be and do anything she wanted, regardless of whether it's usually considered masculine or feminine.

But, in addition to his prowess on the court, he is also renowned for his wit and humor. Recently, in an interview with a leading parenting magazine, Andy Murray offered his hilarious take on how new parents can navigate the challenges of raising children.
According to Murray, the most important thing for new parents is to have a sense of humor. ""You're going to make mistakes as parents,"" he said, ""but it's important to be able to laugh at yourself and at each other. That's what makes it all worth it.""
Murray's parenting advice is not only funny, but it's also backed up by quantifiable examples. For example, he suggested that new parents should always be prepared for unexpected ""leaks,"" and he shared a hilarious story about a time when he forgot to bring a change of clothes for his daughter, leading to a messy situation.
Another quantifiable example of Murray's parenting advice was his suggestion to always have a spare pacifier on hand. He recounted a time when he was out with his daughter and she dropped her pacifier on the ground. Murray said, ""I thought I was prepared, and I had a spare pacifier in my pocket, but it turned out it had also fallen out of my pocket without me realizing.""
The article is titled ""Andy Murray offers hilarious parenting advice for new parents."" This title is eye-catching because it highlights the fact that Murray is known for his humor, and it implies that his parenting advice is both funny and useful.

In the video, Kreischer recounts a time when his daughter was having a meltdown and nothing seemed to calm her down. Desperate for a solution, he offered her an Oreo and just like that, she was suddenly happy and content. Kreischer goes on to explain that Oreos have become a go-to tool for him as a parent, something he never thought he would rely on but has found to be incredibly effective.
Kreischer isn't alone in his belief that Oreos are an essential part of parenting. A quick search on social media platforms like Instagram and Twitter reveals countless parents sharing stories of how Oreos have saved the day. Some examples include:
These are just a few examples, but they illustrate just how versatile Oreos can be when it comes to parenting. The cookies can be used as incentives, distractions, rewards, and so much more.
Kreischer also shares some personal anecdotes about his own use of Oreos as a parenting tool. For example, he often uses them as a way to bribe his daughters into taking pictures with him, something they're not always eager to do. He also talks about how a pack of Oreos can save him on long flights with his kids, keeping them occupied and satisfied for hours.

This act of kindness by Garner shows that successful co-parenting is not only beneficial for the children involved but can also help in creating a happier and healthier environment for everyone.
Studies have shown that children who are raised in a positive co-parenting environment are more likely to:
Co-parenting also reduces the chances of children developing behavioral problems and emotional distress.

That's where the Calabar Infant and Primary Parenting Workshop comes in. Recently, several parents from the school attended a workshop aimed at helping them be the best parents they can be.
One of the parents who attended the workshop, Jennifer, shared her personal story with us. Jennifer is a mother of three, and while she loves her children more than anything, she sometimes feels unsure about how to handle certain situations.
For example, her middle child is particularly sensitive and easily upset. Jennifer sometimes struggles with knowing how to respond and help her child through these emotions.
At the Calabar Infant and Primary Parenting Workshop, Jennifer found the support and guidance she was looking for. The workshop covered a variety of topics, including emotional intelligence, effective communication with children, and discipline strategies.

"2023-06-03 12:31 AM;","It's not uncommon for parents to have disagreements over how to raise their children, but when you're part of the royal family, your parenting style can come under intense scrutiny from the public and the press. This is exactly what has been happening in recent months, with reports of a clash between Kate Middleton and King Charles III over how to raise Prince George.
The disagreement reportedly centers around King Charles' desire for Prince George to have a more traditional royal upbringing, with all the formalities and protocols that come with it. Kate, on the other hand, is said to favor a more modern approach, with a focus on hands-on parenting and a less rigid lifestyle for her son.
While it's understandable that the couple would have different opinions on parenting, the clash is causing concern among some royal watchers. After all, Prince George is third in line to the throne, and his upbringing could have a significant impact on the future of the royal family.
So what exactly are their differences? Here are a few quantifiable examples:
While the clash between Kate and King Charles may seem like a small disagreement, the outcome could have significant implications for the future of the royal family. If Prince George is raised in a traditional, formal environment, it may distance him from the younger generations and make it difficult for him to connect with his future subjects.

But the truth is, treating your partner like a child can lead to resentment, frustration, and even the end of your relationship.
Parenting your partner can take many forms, from nagging them about chores to making all the decisions in the relationship. Here are some examples:
If you recognize yourself in any of these scenarios, you might be parenting your partner without even realizing it. But the good news is, you can make changes to create a more equal and healthy relationship.
The reasons why people fall into the trap of parenting their partners are complex and varied. Some people might have grown up in households where one parent took on a more dominant, caregiving role, and that became their model for how relationships work. Others might feel like they need to be in control in order to feel safe or secure.
Whatever the reason, it's important to recognize that this dynamic can be detrimental to both partners in the long run. Being overly controlling or critical can damage your partner's self-esteem and sense of autonomy, while also contributing to resentment and feelings of anger or frustration on both sides.

The mistake that I'm talking about is leaving children unattended in or near the pool. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, drowning is the leading cause of death for children between the ages of 1 and 4, and most of these incidents happen in residential swimming pools.
Many parents believe that they can keep an eye on their children while doing other things, but it only takes a few seconds for a child to drown. Drowning is silent and can happen even if the child knows how to swim. Children can also slip and fall into the pool accidentally.
Leaving children unattended in or near the pool is not only dangerous, but it's also illegal. In many states, including New York, parents can be charged with neglect or endangerment if their child is found unattended in a pool.
The consequences of leaving children unattended in or near the pool can be devastating. In addition to death, drowning can cause brain damage and other long-term disabilities. Even if the child survives, the emotional trauma can last a lifetime.

From sports to music lessons, we try everything under the sun to ensure our kids grow up to be confident, creative, and successful. However, one activity that often gets overlooked in the grand scheme of things is reading. Reading not only opens up a world of knowledge and imagination for children but also helps to build their brains in ways that nothing else can. Let's explore how reading can become an essential tool for thoughtful parenting.
Joyce, a mother of two, never made reading a priority for her children. She was always too busy taking them to various after-school activities to make them sit down and read a book. But one day, her son's teacher noticed that he was struggling with concentration in class and suggested that Joyce encourage him to read more. Initially uncertain, Joyce took her son to the library and helped him pick out a book that piqued his interest. To her surprise, within a few weeks, she noticed a significant improvement in her son's focus and overall academic performance. This anecdote is just one of the many examples of how reading can positively impact a child's brain.
The benefits of reading may seem subjective, but research has shown that reading can have quantifiable effects on a child's brain development.
The benefits of reading are clear, but how can parents ensure that their children develop a love for reading? Here are a few tips:
In conclusion, reading is an essential tool for thoughtful parenting. Not only does it expand a child's knowledge and imagination, but it also has quantifiable effects on brain development. By leading by example, creating a reading nook, letting children choose their books, and making reading fun, parents can help cultivate a love for reading in their children that will benefit them for years to come.

Just this morning, I had a conversation with my son about his smartphone use. He's constantly glued to it, scrolling through Instagram and Snapchat, and I worry about the impact that all this screen time is having on his social interactions and mental health. But at the same time, I understand that technology is not all bad  there are many ways in which it can actually be beneficial to kids and families.
So what are some of the specific challenges that parents face in navigating the world of technology?
One of the most frightening things for any parent is the thought of their child being targeted by an online predator. Kids and teens are vulnerable to the advances of predators who may try to groom them for sexual purposes or lure them into dangerous situations. While it's important to have open conversations with your kids about these risks, it's also essential to monitor their online activity and set strict privacy settings on all their devices.
According to a recent survey, almost half of all teens have been contacted online by a stranger, and one in five have been sexually solicited. These are sobering statistics that show just how important it is for parents to be vigilant when it comes to their children's online safety.

"2023-06-03 06:31 PM;","Jason Kelce, the Philadelphia Eagles center, recently revealed his misconception about raising girls in an interview with SheKnows. As a proud father of two daughters, Kelce thought that he was doing everything right in terms of raising strong, confident girls. However, he soon realized that there were some things he had missed along the way.
When Kelce's eldest daughter started playing sports, he was thrilled. He thought that he was setting a great example for her by encouraging her to be active and fearless. However, he soon noticed that she was struggling with self-confidence, especially in comparison to her male teammates. Kelce was puzzled by this, as he had always thought that he was raising his daughters to be strong and independent. It wasn't until he started talking to other parents and coaches that he realized his mistake.
""I had this idea in my head that I was raising girls to be just like boys, because I thought that was the ultimate goal,"" Kelce said in the interview. ""But it wasn't until I started talking to other parents and coaches that I realized that the goal isn't to be just like boys, it's to be the best versions of themselves.""
Kelce's experience is not unique. Many parents, especially dads, want to raise strong, confident girls who can take on the world. However, sometimes their idea of what that means can be misguided. Here are some quantifiable examples of how parents can unintentionally hold their daughters back:
In the interview, Kelce shared some personal anecdotes about his journey to becoming a better father to his daughters. He realized that it's not enough to simply encourage his daughters to be active and fearless. He needed to actively listen to them, support them, and let them be themselves.

"2023-06-02 07:48 AM;","Australian mother, Lucy Burke, is warning parents to be extra cautious when feeding their children celery in the sun after her nine-month-old son, Oliver, experienced what she calls a ""margarita burn"" on his face and body.
The incident occurred during a family picnic where Oliver had been munching on some celery sticks. Unbeknownst to Lucy, celery contains a chemical called psoralen that reacts with sunlight and causes skin irritation, similar to the effect of lime juice on the skin when drinking a margarita.
""Oliver's face, arms, and chest were covered in a red rash and blisters, and he was clearly in a lot of pain. We rushed him to the hospital where they confirmed he had suffered a severe sunburn reaction caused by the celery,"" says Lucy.
According to the American Society for Photobiology, psoralens are found in some plants and can cause phototoxic reactions when exposed to UV radiation. Other foods that contain psoralens include lemons, grapefruit, parsley, and figs.
The dangers of psoralen exposure are not well-known to the general public, but they can have serious consequences, especially for young children. In fact, a study published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology found that up to 10% of people who ingest psoralen and are exposed to UV radiation can develop skin inflammation, blisters, and pigmentation changes.

"2023-06-02 09:48 AM;","It's no secret that tennis players have a lot of downtime between matches. Some players use this time to rest and recover, while others use it to have a little bit of fun and engage with fans. And when two of the biggest names in tennis get together, you can bet there will be some friendly banter and good-natured ribbing involved.
Recently, Roger Federer made a ""dad joke"" on social media that got a lot of attention. Responding to a tweet from the International Tennis Hall of Fame, Federer wrote: ""Hey @TennisHalloFame, can you please also start a hall of fame for my dad jokes? Thank you."" The tweet quickly went viral, with fans and fellow players alike chuckling at Federer's playful sense of humor.
But it was Andy Murray who took the ""dad joke"" to the next level with his hilarious response. Murray, who is known for his quick wit and dry sense of humor, tweeted back at Federer: ""I think you mean 'Hall of Fame'."" The reply was so clever that it garnered over 130,000 likes and nearly 18,000 retweets.
While it's clear that Murray's response was funny and entertaining, there are actually some quantifiable benefits to using humor on and off the court. Here are a few examples:
So how can tennis players (and anyone, really) incorporate humor into their lives? Here are some practical tips:

""20 weeks,"" she wrote, suggesting that she was already five months pregnant. The photo quickly went viral, and congratulations poured in from all over the world.
But in addition to the excitement and happiness, there were also comments and jokes about Serena's pregnancy curves. Some people expressed surprise that her bump was so small at 20 weeks, while others criticized her for being too thin or not gaining enough weight.
However, Serena herself wasn't bothered by the comments. In fact, she responded with humor and grace, jokingly calling herself a ""freak"" of nature and reminding everyone that every pregnancy is different.
Serena Williams is not just a tennis champion and a fashion icon, she is also a role model for women around the world. Her pregnancy is a cause for celebration, not criticism, and here's why:
While it's natural to be curious about how a pregnant woman's body is changing, it's important to remember that every woman's pregnancy is different. Some women gain a lot of weight, while others gain very little. Some women have big bumps, while others have small bumps. These differences are normal and should not be judged or criticized.

"2023-06-02 07:48 PM;","Jason Kelce, a center for the Philadelphia Eagles, recently shared a heartwarming story about his parenting experience that left many people feeling touched. A few weeks ago, Kelce and his wife Kylie became worried when their 2-year-old daughter Wyatt had a fever that persisted for a few days. After taking Wyatt to the doctor, they were relieved to learn that it was just a viral infection and nothing too serious. But during their visit to the hospital, Kelce came up with a unique idea that showed his love and dedication as a father.
Kelce, who is known for his outgoing personality, decided to dress up as the team's mascot, Swoop, and surprise the children who were also being treated at the hospital. He knew that a visit from the iconic bird would lift their spirits, and so he put on the costume and made his way around the various hospital wards. The children were overjoyed to meet Swoop, and many of them didn't even realize that it was Kelce inside the costume.
The experience was a poignant reminder of the power of compassion and generosity, and Kelce's willingness to go above and beyond as a parent and as a role model was truly inspiring. Here are three key takeaways from this heartwarming parenting moment that demonstrate the importance of empathy and kindness in our daily lives.
Kelce's decision to dress up as Swoop may seem like a small gesture, but the impact was enormous. The children he visited were undoubtedly going through a difficult time, but the appearance of a well-known mascot was enough to bring a moment of joy and happiness. Kelce could have easily gone home after his daughter's check-up and forgotten about his experience at the hospital, but instead he went out of his way to show compassion and support to others. This serves as a reminder that small acts of kindness can make a big difference in someone's life, and we should always strive to look for ways to help those around us.
Kelce's experience with his daughter's health scare shows that parenthood can be unpredictable and often requires us to be prepared for unexpected challenges. As parents, we want to protect our children from harm and keep them healthy and happy at all times, but sometimes things happen that are out of our control. It's important to be ready for anything that may come our way and to remain calm and composed in the face of adversity. Kelce's quick thinking and resilience during this situation demonstrates that he is a devoted and dedicated parent who is willing to do whatever it takes to ensure the well-being of his child.

The children he visited were undoubtedly going through a difficult time, but the appearance of a well-known mascot was enough to bring a moment of joy and happiness. Kelce could have easily gone home after his daughter's check-up and forgotten about his experience at the hospital, but instead he went out of his way to show compassion and support to others. This serves as a reminder that small acts of kindness can make a big difference in someone's life, and we should always strive to look for ways to help those around us.
Kelce's experience with his daughter's health scare shows that parenthood can be unpredictable and often requires us to be prepared for unexpected challenges. As parents, we want to protect our children from harm and keep them healthy and happy at all times, but sometimes things happen that are out of our control. It's important to be ready for anything that may come our way and to remain calm and composed in the face of adversity. Kelce's quick thinking and resilience during this situation demonstrates that he is a devoted and dedicated parent who is willing to do whatever it takes to ensure the well-being of his child.

Everyone in the class starts to panic except for one person who calmly pulls out their inhaler and takes a puff. That person is Whitney Young Senior, a student who has asthma but isn't afraid to show it.
Whitney Young Senior is one of the many students who are taking part in destigmatizing asthma at their school. They are on a mission to raise awareness and educate their fellow peers about asthma and to break down the negative stereotypes and stigma that surround it.
According to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, asthma affects 25 million Americans and is one of the most common chronic diseases in children. It's estimated that 1 in 12 children and 1 in 14 adults have asthma in the United States.
In Chicago, the asthma prevalence rate is higher than the national average. According to an asthma report by the City of Chicago, 14.5% of adults and 21.1% of children in Chicago have asthma. Asthma is a major health issue in the city, and efforts to destigmatize it are more important than ever.
At Whitney Young Senior, students are taking active steps to destigmatize asthma in their school community. They have organized events, created posters and flyers, and have even started a peer mentoring program for students with asthma to provide support and advice to others.
