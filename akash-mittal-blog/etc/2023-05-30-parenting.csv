"2023-06-02 04:31 AM;","A few months ago, Suzy's 10-year-old daughter came to her with a plea for a cell phone. ""All my friends have one, Mom,"" she said. ""I'm the only one without."" Suzy had been dreading this conversation, as she knew all too well the challenges of parenting in the digital age. Between online predators, cyberbullying, and screen addiction, she worried about the dangers lurking in her daughter's phone. But she also knew that technology was a necessary part of modern life, and that she couldn't keep her daughter in a bubble forever. So, after much discussion and negotiation, Suzy agreed to get her daughter a phone, with strict rules and monitoring.
Suzy's story is not unique. Parenting in the age of technology is full of challenges and demands, from the youngest children who are exposed to screens from birth, to the teenagers who are navigating social media and online relationships. In this article, we will explore some of the technology challenges facing parents today, and offer tips for navigating the digital landscape.
Technology has brought many wonderful advancements to our lives, from smartphones to smart homes, from social media to online education. However, with these advancements come new challenges and concerns for parents.
One of the biggest concerns for parents in the digital age is the safety and security of their children online. The internet is full of potential dangers, from cyberbullying and online predators to scams and viruses. Parents need to be aware of these risks and take steps to protect their children.

"2023-06-02 06:31 AM;","June is commonly celebrated as Pride month in honor of the LGBTQ+ community. While many of us look forward to colorful parades and events during Pride month, it's also an essential time to instill important values in our children regarding love, diversity, and acceptance. As a parent, you have the power to influence your child's perceptions and attitudes. So, it's critical to take advantage of this time to actively teach your kids about the LGBTQ+ community and create a safe space for all kids.
When my son, Tom, was six years old, we went to the park and saw a family with two moms. Tom curiously asked me, ""Mommy, why does that family look a little different than ours?"". I seized the moment and explained to him how families could have different structures. I explained to him that some families have two moms or dads, and it's essential to respect everyone, no matter how they look or who they love. Since then, our family's conversations around Pride month and diversity have become more rigorous and educated.
How to raise an accepting child in the month of Pride: The Essential Guide
Recently, a family friend shared a story with me about how she had used Pride month to explain to her five-year-old child how gender worked. Her child had always been curious about how people decided whether they were boys or girls, and her friend decided it was high time she explained it to her. Together, they discussed different labels and how they applied. The child was surprised to learn that sex organs don't identify gender, and that she could be and do anything she wanted, regardless of whether it's usually considered masculine or feminine.

But, in addition to his prowess on the court, he is also renowned for his wit and humor. Recently, in an interview with a leading parenting magazine, Andy Murray offered his hilarious take on how new parents can navigate the challenges of raising children.
According to Murray, the most important thing for new parents is to have a sense of humor. ""You're going to make mistakes as parents,"" he said, ""but it's important to be able to laugh at yourself and at each other. That's what makes it all worth it.""
Murray's parenting advice is not only funny, but it's also backed up by quantifiable examples. For example, he suggested that new parents should always be prepared for unexpected ""leaks,"" and he shared a hilarious story about a time when he forgot to bring a change of clothes for his daughter, leading to a messy situation.
Another quantifiable example of Murray's parenting advice was his suggestion to always have a spare pacifier on hand. He recounted a time when he was out with his daughter and she dropped her pacifier on the ground. Murray said, ""I thought I was prepared, and I had a spare pacifier in my pocket, but it turned out it had also fallen out of my pocket without me realizing.""
The article is titled ""Andy Murray offers hilarious parenting advice for new parents."" This title is eye-catching because it highlights the fact that Murray is known for his humor, and it implies that his parenting advice is both funny and useful.

In the video, Kreischer recounts a time when his daughter was having a meltdown and nothing seemed to calm her down. Desperate for a solution, he offered her an Oreo and just like that, she was suddenly happy and content. Kreischer goes on to explain that Oreos have become a go-to tool for him as a parent, something he never thought he would rely on but has found to be incredibly effective.
Kreischer isn't alone in his belief that Oreos are an essential part of parenting. A quick search on social media platforms like Instagram and Twitter reveals countless parents sharing stories of how Oreos have saved the day. Some examples include:
These are just a few examples, but they illustrate just how versatile Oreos can be when it comes to parenting. The cookies can be used as incentives, distractions, rewards, and so much more.
Kreischer also shares some personal anecdotes about his own use of Oreos as a parenting tool. For example, he often uses them as a way to bribe his daughters into taking pictures with him, something they're not always eager to do. He also talks about how a pack of Oreos can save him on long flights with his kids, keeping them occupied and satisfied for hours.

This act of kindness by Garner shows that successful co-parenting is not only beneficial for the children involved but can also help in creating a happier and healthier environment for everyone.
Studies have shown that children who are raised in a positive co-parenting environment are more likely to:
Co-parenting also reduces the chances of children developing behavioral problems and emotional distress.

That's where the Calabar Infant and Primary Parenting Workshop comes in. Recently, several parents from the school attended a workshop aimed at helping them be the best parents they can be.
One of the parents who attended the workshop, Jennifer, shared her personal story with us. Jennifer is a mother of three, and while she loves her children more than anything, she sometimes feels unsure about how to handle certain situations.
For example, her middle child is particularly sensitive and easily upset. Jennifer sometimes struggles with knowing how to respond and help her child through these emotions.
At the Calabar Infant and Primary Parenting Workshop, Jennifer found the support and guidance she was looking for. The workshop covered a variety of topics, including emotional intelligence, effective communication with children, and discipline strategies.

"2023-06-03 12:31 AM;","It's not uncommon for parents to have disagreements over how to raise their children, but when you're part of the royal family, your parenting style can come under intense scrutiny from the public and the press. This is exactly what has been happening in recent months, with reports of a clash between Kate Middleton and King Charles III over how to raise Prince George.
The disagreement reportedly centers around King Charles' desire for Prince George to have a more traditional royal upbringing, with all the formalities and protocols that come with it. Kate, on the other hand, is said to favor a more modern approach, with a focus on hands-on parenting and a less rigid lifestyle for her son.
While it's understandable that the couple would have different opinions on parenting, the clash is causing concern among some royal watchers. After all, Prince George is third in line to the throne, and his upbringing could have a significant impact on the future of the royal family.
So what exactly are their differences? Here are a few quantifiable examples:
While the clash between Kate and King Charles may seem like a small disagreement, the outcome could have significant implications for the future of the royal family. If Prince George is raised in a traditional, formal environment, it may distance him from the younger generations and make it difficult for him to connect with his future subjects.

But the truth is, treating your partner like a child can lead to resentment, frustration, and even the end of your relationship.
Parenting your partner can take many forms, from nagging them about chores to making all the decisions in the relationship. Here are some examples:
If you recognize yourself in any of these scenarios, you might be parenting your partner without even realizing it. But the good news is, you can make changes to create a more equal and healthy relationship.
The reasons why people fall into the trap of parenting their partners are complex and varied. Some people might have grown up in households where one parent took on a more dominant, caregiving role, and that became their model for how relationships work. Others might feel like they need to be in control in order to feel safe or secure.
Whatever the reason, it's important to recognize that this dynamic can be detrimental to both partners in the long run. Being overly controlling or critical can damage your partner's self-esteem and sense of autonomy, while also contributing to resentment and feelings of anger or frustration on both sides.

The mistake that I'm talking about is leaving children unattended in or near the pool. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, drowning is the leading cause of death for children between the ages of 1 and 4, and most of these incidents happen in residential swimming pools.
Many parents believe that they can keep an eye on their children while doing other things, but it only takes a few seconds for a child to drown. Drowning is silent and can happen even if the child knows how to swim. Children can also slip and fall into the pool accidentally.
Leaving children unattended in or near the pool is not only dangerous, but it's also illegal. In many states, including New York, parents can be charged with neglect or endangerment if their child is found unattended in a pool.
The consequences of leaving children unattended in or near the pool can be devastating. In addition to death, drowning can cause brain damage and other long-term disabilities. Even if the child survives, the emotional trauma can last a lifetime.

From sports to music lessons, we try everything under the sun to ensure our kids grow up to be confident, creative, and successful. However, one activity that often gets overlooked in the grand scheme of things is reading. Reading not only opens up a world of knowledge and imagination for children but also helps to build their brains in ways that nothing else can. Let's explore how reading can become an essential tool for thoughtful parenting.
Joyce, a mother of two, never made reading a priority for her children. She was always too busy taking them to various after-school activities to make them sit down and read a book. But one day, her son's teacher noticed that he was struggling with concentration in class and suggested that Joyce encourage him to read more. Initially uncertain, Joyce took her son to the library and helped him pick out a book that piqued his interest. To her surprise, within a few weeks, she noticed a significant improvement in her son's focus and overall academic performance. This anecdote is just one of the many examples of how reading can positively impact a child's brain.
The benefits of reading may seem subjective, but research has shown that reading can have quantifiable effects on a child's brain development.
The benefits of reading are clear, but how can parents ensure that their children develop a love for reading? Here are a few tips:
In conclusion, reading is an essential tool for thoughtful parenting. Not only does it expand a child's knowledge and imagination, but it also has quantifiable effects on brain development. By leading by example, creating a reading nook, letting children choose their books, and making reading fun, parents can help cultivate a love for reading in their children that will benefit them for years to come.

Just this morning, I had a conversation with my son about his smartphone use. He's constantly glued to it, scrolling through Instagram and Snapchat, and I worry about the impact that all this screen time is having on his social interactions and mental health. But at the same time, I understand that technology is not all bad  there are many ways in which it can actually be beneficial to kids and families.
So what are some of the specific challenges that parents face in navigating the world of technology?
One of the most frightening things for any parent is the thought of their child being targeted by an online predator. Kids and teens are vulnerable to the advances of predators who may try to groom them for sexual purposes or lure them into dangerous situations. While it's important to have open conversations with your kids about these risks, it's also essential to monitor their online activity and set strict privacy settings on all their devices.
According to a recent survey, almost half of all teens have been contacted online by a stranger, and one in five have been sexually solicited. These are sobering statistics that show just how important it is for parents to be vigilant when it comes to their children's online safety.

"2023-06-03 06:31 PM;","Jason Kelce, the Philadelphia Eagles center, recently revealed his misconception about raising girls in an interview with SheKnows. As a proud father of two daughters, Kelce thought that he was doing everything right in terms of raising strong, confident girls. However, he soon realized that there were some things he had missed along the way.
When Kelce's eldest daughter started playing sports, he was thrilled. He thought that he was setting a great example for her by encouraging her to be active and fearless. However, he soon noticed that she was struggling with self-confidence, especially in comparison to her male teammates. Kelce was puzzled by this, as he had always thought that he was raising his daughters to be strong and independent. It wasn't until he started talking to other parents and coaches that he realized his mistake.
""I had this idea in my head that I was raising girls to be just like boys, because I thought that was the ultimate goal,"" Kelce said in the interview. ""But it wasn't until I started talking to other parents and coaches that I realized that the goal isn't to be just like boys, it's to be the best versions of themselves.""
Kelce's experience is not unique. Many parents, especially dads, want to raise strong, confident girls who can take on the world. However, sometimes their idea of what that means can be misguided. Here are some quantifiable examples of how parents can unintentionally hold their daughters back:
In the interview, Kelce shared some personal anecdotes about his journey to becoming a better father to his daughters. He realized that it's not enough to simply encourage his daughters to be active and fearless. He needed to actively listen to them, support them, and let them be themselves.

"2023-06-02 07:48 AM;","Australian mother, Lucy Burke, is warning parents to be extra cautious when feeding their children celery in the sun after her nine-month-old son, Oliver, experienced what she calls a ""margarita burn"" on his face and body.
The incident occurred during a family picnic where Oliver had been munching on some celery sticks. Unbeknownst to Lucy, celery contains a chemical called psoralen that reacts with sunlight and causes skin irritation, similar to the effect of lime juice on the skin when drinking a margarita.
""Oliver's face, arms, and chest were covered in a red rash and blisters, and he was clearly in a lot of pain. We rushed him to the hospital where they confirmed he had suffered a severe sunburn reaction caused by the celery,"" says Lucy.
According to the American Society for Photobiology, psoralens are found in some plants and can cause phototoxic reactions when exposed to UV radiation. Other foods that contain psoralens include lemons, grapefruit, parsley, and figs.
The dangers of psoralen exposure are not well-known to the general public, but they can have serious consequences, especially for young children. In fact, a study published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology found that up to 10% of people who ingest psoralen and are exposed to UV radiation can develop skin inflammation, blisters, and pigmentation changes.

"2023-06-02 09:48 AM;","It's no secret that tennis players have a lot of downtime between matches. Some players use this time to rest and recover, while others use it to have a little bit of fun and engage with fans. And when two of the biggest names in tennis get together, you can bet there will be some friendly banter and good-natured ribbing involved.
Recently, Roger Federer made a ""dad joke"" on social media that got a lot of attention. Responding to a tweet from the International Tennis Hall of Fame, Federer wrote: ""Hey @TennisHalloFame, can you please also start a hall of fame for my dad jokes? Thank you."" The tweet quickly went viral, with fans and fellow players alike chuckling at Federer's playful sense of humor.
But it was Andy Murray who took the ""dad joke"" to the next level with his hilarious response. Murray, who is known for his quick wit and dry sense of humor, tweeted back at Federer: ""I think you mean 'Hall of Fame'."" The reply was so clever that it garnered over 130,000 likes and nearly 18,000 retweets.
While it's clear that Murray's response was funny and entertaining, there are actually some quantifiable benefits to using humor on and off the court. Here are a few examples:
So how can tennis players (and anyone, really) incorporate humor into their lives? Here are some practical tips:

""20 weeks,"" she wrote, suggesting that she was already five months pregnant. The photo quickly went viral, and congratulations poured in from all over the world.
But in addition to the excitement and happiness, there were also comments and jokes about Serena's pregnancy curves. Some people expressed surprise that her bump was so small at 20 weeks, while others criticized her for being too thin or not gaining enough weight.
However, Serena herself wasn't bothered by the comments. In fact, she responded with humor and grace, jokingly calling herself a ""freak"" of nature and reminding everyone that every pregnancy is different.
Serena Williams is not just a tennis champion and a fashion icon, she is also a role model for women around the world. Her pregnancy is a cause for celebration, not criticism, and here's why:
While it's natural to be curious about how a pregnant woman's body is changing, it's important to remember that every woman's pregnancy is different. Some women gain a lot of weight, while others gain very little. Some women have big bumps, while others have small bumps. These differences are normal and should not be judged or criticized.

"2023-06-02 07:48 PM;","Jason Kelce, a center for the Philadelphia Eagles, recently shared a heartwarming story about his parenting experience that left many people feeling touched. A few weeks ago, Kelce and his wife Kylie became worried when their 2-year-old daughter Wyatt had a fever that persisted for a few days. After taking Wyatt to the doctor, they were relieved to learn that it was just a viral infection and nothing too serious. But during their visit to the hospital, Kelce came up with a unique idea that showed his love and dedication as a father.
Kelce, who is known for his outgoing personality, decided to dress up as the team's mascot, Swoop, and surprise the children who were also being treated at the hospital. He knew that a visit from the iconic bird would lift their spirits, and so he put on the costume and made his way around the various hospital wards. The children were overjoyed to meet Swoop, and many of them didn't even realize that it was Kelce inside the costume.
The experience was a poignant reminder of the power of compassion and generosity, and Kelce's willingness to go above and beyond as a parent and as a role model was truly inspiring. Here are three key takeaways from this heartwarming parenting moment that demonstrate the importance of empathy and kindness in our daily lives.
Kelce's decision to dress up as Swoop may seem like a small gesture, but the impact was enormous. The children he visited were undoubtedly going through a difficult time, but the appearance of a well-known mascot was enough to bring a moment of joy and happiness. Kelce could have easily gone home after his daughter's check-up and forgotten about his experience at the hospital, but instead he went out of his way to show compassion and support to others. This serves as a reminder that small acts of kindness can make a big difference in someone's life, and we should always strive to look for ways to help those around us.
Kelce's experience with his daughter's health scare shows that parenthood can be unpredictable and often requires us to be prepared for unexpected challenges. As parents, we want to protect our children from harm and keep them healthy and happy at all times, but sometimes things happen that are out of our control. It's important to be ready for anything that may come our way and to remain calm and composed in the face of adversity. Kelce's quick thinking and resilience during this situation demonstrates that he is a devoted and dedicated parent who is willing to do whatever it takes to ensure the well-being of his child.

The children he visited were undoubtedly going through a difficult time, but the appearance of a well-known mascot was enough to bring a moment of joy and happiness. Kelce could have easily gone home after his daughter's check-up and forgotten about his experience at the hospital, but instead he went out of his way to show compassion and support to others. This serves as a reminder that small acts of kindness can make a big difference in someone's life, and we should always strive to look for ways to help those around us.
Kelce's experience with his daughter's health scare shows that parenthood can be unpredictable and often requires us to be prepared for unexpected challenges. As parents, we want to protect our children from harm and keep them healthy and happy at all times, but sometimes things happen that are out of our control. It's important to be ready for anything that may come our way and to remain calm and composed in the face of adversity. Kelce's quick thinking and resilience during this situation demonstrates that he is a devoted and dedicated parent who is willing to do whatever it takes to ensure the well-being of his child.

"2023-06-02 09:48 PM;","Imagine you're in a class with your friend who has asthma, suddenly they start coughing and wheezing. Everyone in the class starts to panic except for one person who calmly pulls out their inhaler and takes a puff. That person is Whitney Young Senior, a student who has asthma but isn't afraid to show it.
Whitney Young Senior is one of the many students who are taking part in destigmatizing asthma at their school. They are on a mission to raise awareness and educate their fellow peers about asthma and to break down the negative stereotypes and stigma that surround it.
According to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, asthma affects 25 million Americans and is one of the most common chronic diseases in children. It's estimated that 1 in 12 children and 1 in 14 adults have asthma in the United States.
In Chicago, the asthma prevalence rate is higher than the national average. According to an asthma report by the City of Chicago, 14.5% of adults and 21.1% of children in Chicago have asthma. Asthma is a major health issue in the city, and efforts to destigmatize it are more important than ever.
At Whitney Young Senior, students are taking active steps to destigmatize asthma in their school community. They have organized events, created posters and flyers, and have even started a peer mentoring program for students with asthma to provide support and advice to others.

"2023-06-02 11:30 PM;","Despite rumors of reconciliation, it seems that Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson are not back together. According to sources close to the couple, they are still just co-parenting their daughter True.
This news may come as a disappointment to some fans who were hoping for a reunion between the two. After all, Khloe and Tristan have had a tumultuous relationship in the past. In 2018, it was revealed that Tristan cheated on Khloe while she was pregnant with True. Despite this betrayal, Khloe decided to give Tristan another chance, and the two continued to date on and off over the next few years.
However, it seems that things may have finally come to an end for good between the two. While they are both committed to co-parenting their daughter, they are not interested in getting back together romantically.
So what does co-parenting look like for Khloe and Tristan? According to sources, they have worked out a schedule that allows each of them to spend time with True. This includes spending holidays and special occasions together as a family.
They also communicate frequently about True's needs and are in agreement about how to raise her. For example, both Khloe and Tristan have been vocal about their desire for True to have a close relationship with both of them, despite their past relationship troubles. They are also both committed to providing a stable and loving home environment for their daughter.

"2023-06-03 01:30 AM;","Divorces are difficult for everyone involved, especially when it comes to dividing parenting responsibilities. Parents may find themselves at odds with one another, and the courts are often required to step in to make decisions about child custody and visitation rights. However, the Illinois Supreme Court has recently adopted a new rule establishing a Parenting Coordination Program, which aims to help resolve disputes between parents and promote the best interests of the children involved.
The new rule, which took effect on January 1, 2020, establishes a Parenting Coordination Program that provides a mechanism for parents to resolve disputes about parenting matters. The program is designed to be a non-adversarial process that promotes cooperation between parents and helps them make decisions in the best interests of their children.
Under the program, a parenting coordinator is appointed to work with the parents and their attorneys to help them resolve disputes. The coordinator is a neutral third party who has training in child development, family dynamics, and dispute resolution. They act as a mediator, facilitator, and educator, and help parents develop parenting plans that are in the best interests of their children.
Parenting coordinators can help parents with a wide range of issues related to parenting, including visitation schedules, custody arrangements, communication between parents, and decision-making responsibilities. They can also help parents address issues related to the children's education, health care, and extracurricular activities.
The Parenting Coordination Program offers several benefits for parents and children. For one, it helps reduce the adversarial nature of divorce proceedings. Instead of going to court to resolve disputes, parents can work with a parenting coordinator in a more collaborative and cooperative manner. This can help reduce stress and conflict for everyone involved.

"2023-06-03 03:30 AM;","Parenting is not an easy job. As a parent, we always try to do the best for our children. We want to help them grow up to be happy, healthy, successful adults. But sometimes, our efforts to do so can backfire. That's why it's important to make subtle shifts in our parenting style. In this article, we'll discuss three of those subtle shifts that can help you train up your child.
As parents, we want our children to succeed. We want them to get good grades, win sports games, and eventually, get into a good college and land a great job. But when we focus too much on the outcome, we miss out on the opportunity to teach our children valuable life skills.
For example, let's say your child comes home from school with a C on a math test. Instead of just berating them for not doing better, focus on the process. Ask them how they studied for the test, and what they could do differently next time. Help them come up with a plan for improving their grade, rather than just focusing on the fact that they got a C.
Failure is a part of life. We all experience it at some point or another. But as parents, our natural instinct is to protect our children from failure. We want to shield them from pain and disappointment.
However, research has shown that building resilience through failure can actually help our children succeed in the long run. So instead of trying to protect them from failure, teach your children how to bounce back from it. Help them see failure as an opportunity to learn and grow, rather than the end of the world.

By taking time for yourself, connecting with other moms, and pursuing your passions, you can find a new sense of purpose and fulfillment in your life.

"2023-06-03 07:30 AM;","""Social media has its pros and cons, but the pressure to constantly seek validation from it is definitely one of its most harmful effects, especially among kids and young adults.""
Cheska Garcia Kramer, a well-known actress, entrepreneur, and mother of three, has recently shared her thoughts on the negative impact of social media on mental health, particularly on the younger generation. In a series of Instagram stories, she urged her followers, especially the youth, to stop seeking validation from social media, as it is damaging to one's self-esteem and sense of worth.
As someone who has been in the public eye for decades, Cheska has seen the evolution of social media and its influence on people's lives firsthand. While she acknowledges its benefits, such as easier communication and wider reach for businesses and causes, she also highlights the dangers of using social media as a measure of one's value as a person.
Cheska's concern over the impact of social media on self-esteem and mental health is not unfounded. Several studies have shown the negative effects of social media on young people's emotional and psychological well-being. For example:
These studies, among others, suggest that the more time young people spend on social media, the more likely they are to experience negative emotions and thoughts, such as jealousy, insecurity, and FOMO (fear of missing out).

"2023-06-03 11:30 AM;","When Larry Lawton was 19, he was sentenced to 11 years in federal prison for his role in a jewelry heist. But it was during his time behind bars that Lawton took a hard look at his life and made a decision to change. He completed his sentence, turned his life around, and became a successful author, motivational speaker, and founder of the Reality Check Program, which educates young people on the dangers of drugs, crime, and gangs.
Now, Lawton is taking his message of second chances to a new audience: parents. In 2023, he will host a parenting seminar aimed at helping parents raise responsible, well-adjusted children who stay out of trouble.
Here are some alarming statistics that illustrate the need for such a seminar:
The good news is that research has shown that parents who are actively involved in their children's lives are more likely to raise children who avoid risky behaviors and stay out of trouble.
During the seminar, Lawton will provide parents with practical tools and techniques for raising responsible, well-adjusted children. Here are just a few examples:

John's son required a lot of support in school, which meant taking time off work to attend teacher meetings, therapy sessions, and tutoring sessions. This resulted in John feeling overwhelmed and stressed, and he struggled to perform at his best at work.
Unfortunately, John's experience is not unique. Parents of neurodivergent children often face unique challenges that can make balancing work and home life extremely difficult.
Employers have a role to play in ensuring that their employees who are parents of neurodivergent children are supported and able to excel in their roles. Here are some quantifiable examples of why this support is needed:
These statistics show that parents of neurodivergent children face unique challenges that can impact their work performance and career progression. However, employers who offer support and accommodations can help these employees thrive.

"2023-06-03 03:30 PM;","Being a college student can be tough. But for those who are also parents, the challenges are even greater. Balancing classes, studying, and parenting can leave little time for much else. Fortunately, lawmakers in Texas are taking steps to make college education more accessible and affordable for student parents.
In 2019, Texas lawmakers passed legislation that aims to make higher education more accessible for student parents. Senate Bill 151, also known as the Student Parent Success Initiative, provides funding for colleges and universities to create programs and services specifically designed to support student parents.
With this legislation, colleges and universities can provide child care services, academic advising, counseling, and other resources to help student parents succeed in school. It also helps cover costs such as textbooks, transportation, and housing for those who need it. By removing some of the financial and logistical barriers to higher education, student parents can better achieve their academic and career goals.
While the legislation is still new, it's important to note the impact of supportive programs for student parents. Colleges and universities that have already implemented such programs have seen positive results. For example, Amarillo College's ""No Excuses"" program aims to help low-income and first-generation students succeed in college. Through this program, student parents can access child care services, academic support, and career guidance. Since its inception, the program has helped over 5,000 students, with a graduation rate of 63% among program participants.
Another example is the University of Texas at Austin's Supporting Student-Parent Initiatives program, which provides emergency grants, academic support, and child care assistance to student parents. The program has helped over 200 student parents in its first year alone. A survey of program participants found that 91% felt more comfortable discussing their academic and family needs with faculty and staff, while 68% reported an increase in academic success.

"2023-06-03 09:30 PM;","As a young man, Larry Lawton found himself on the wrong side of the law. He spent ten years in prison for his crimes, but eventually turned his life around and became an advocate for criminal justice reform. Now, Lawton is taking his message to parents with a seminar focused on preventing kids from going down the path he once did.
Lawton's journey started in a Florida jail, where he served time for burglary. During his sentence, he began to realize that he had made a huge mistake and started to think about how he had ended up there in the first place. After getting out of prison, he dedicated himself to helping others avoid the same fate.
Through his nonprofit, the Reality Check Program, Lawton has spoken to thousands of young people about the consequences of criminal activity. His message has resonated with audiences, and now he's expanding his reach to parents.
According to the National Institute of Justice, children who have parents who are involved in their lives are less likely to get involved in criminal activity. In fact, a study found that children who had dinner with their families four or more times a week were 80% less likely to be involved in drugs and alcohol.
Lawton's seminar will provide parents with practical tips on how to create an environment that fosters communication and trust. Studies have shown that children who feel supported by their parents are more likely to make positive choices and avoid risky behavior.

One name that has become increasingly popular in recent years is Axel. But before you jump on the trendy bandwagon, you may want to reconsider. Here are a few reasons why:
While the name Axel itself may seem harmless, it's often associated with negative stereotypes. For example, the name has been linked to heavy metal music and alternative lifestyles. Additionally, Axel is a common name in Scandinavia, where it's often associated with a tough, macho image.
According to a 2019 study by Nameberry, an online baby name database, Axel is the 150th most popular name for boys in the United States. However, the name tends to be more popular in certain regions, such as the West Coast and Northeast. In California, for example, Axel is the 52nd most popular boy's name.
While it's certainly possible to break free from stereotypes and create your own meaning for a name, you may want to consider how the name could be perceived by others before making a final decision.

"2023-06-04 07:30 AM;","Every Memorial Day we pay homage to the brave men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation. While many of these heroes' names are etched into history, their stories often remain untold. One such hero is Captain Samuel Sanders Jr., a Fowlerville native who was killed in action in 2006 while serving in Afghanistan.
Captain Sanders was a 1992 graduate of Fowlerville High School and went on to earn a degree from the United States Military Academy at West Point. He served two tours in Iraq prior to his deployment to Afghanistan. During his service, he was awarded numerous medals, including the Bronze Star, the Army Commendation Medal, and the Purple Heart.
Captain Sanders left behind a wife and two children, as well as a legacy of honor and sacrifice. His memory, along with those of other fallen heroes, is honored each year by the Fowlerville community on Memorial Day.
The Fowlerville Memorial Day parade and ceremony are among the community's most cherished traditions. Each year, hundreds of residents gather to pay their respects to the fallen and to celebrate the freedoms they fought to protect.
Memorial Day is not just a day off from work or the unofficial start of summer. It is a day to remember the sacrifice of those who gave their lives in service to their country. It is a day to reflect on the value of freedom and the cost at which it comes.

"2023-06-03 02:26 AM;","As parents, we want what's best for our children. We want them to be happy, healthy, and successful in life. However, sometimes our well-intentioned efforts can backfire and actually harm our kids. There are several popular parenting trends that are actually doing more harm than good. In this article, we'll take a look at some of these harmful trends and provide some practical tips for avoiding them.
Emma is a bright and talented 16-year-old girl. She excels in school, participates in several extracurricular activities, and has a strong group of friends. However, Emma's parents are some of the most overprotective and controlling parents you'll ever meet. They don't allow Emma to do anything without their supervision and constantly hover over her every move. They even go so far as to call Emma's teachers and coaches on a regular basis to ensure that she's doing everything right.
Despite their best intentions, Emma's parents are doing more harm than good. Their helicopter parenting is causing Emma to feel smothered, stressed, and anxious. She feels like she can't make any decisions on her own and is constantly seeking her parents' approval. As a result, Emma is developing a lack of confidence and independence that will likely hinder her in her future endeavors.
While these parenting trends may seem well-intentioned, they can actually cause harm to your child in several ways:

"2023-06-03 04:26 AM;","When I look back on my childhood, I realize how much has changed over the years. Growing up, my mom didn't have access to many of the resources and tools that are available to parents today. While I'm grateful for the advancements that have been made, there are a few things from my mom's generation that I want to bring back. Here are four things I'm grateful for that my mom didn't have and what I want to bring back.
When I was a child, my mom would often take me to the park to play. It was a simple way for us to spend time together and for me to get some exercise and fresh air. One day, while we were at the park, my mom noticed a group of kids playing with a ball. She asked if I wanted to join them, and I hesitated. I was shy and didn't know any of the kids. But my mom encouraged me to give it a try, saying, ""You never know until you try."" I ended up having a great time playing with the other kids and even made a new friend.
Looking back, I realize how important that moment was for me. My mom didn't have to push me to try something new, but she did. She didn't have to encourage me to make new friends, but she did. I'm grateful for her gentle push and for the lesson it taught me. Sometimes, we need a little nudge to get out of our comfort zones and try something new.
When my kids were younger, I used to take them to the park every day. We would run around and play games, and I loved watching them explore the world around them. One day, my son hesitated to climb a ladder on the playground. He was scared and unsure of himself. I could have easily stepped in and lifted him up, but I knew he was capable of doing it himself. So, I encouraged him to take it one step at a time, reminding him that he could do it. And he did! When he reached the top, he was beaming with pride and confidence. That moment reminded me of the importance of encouragement, and how it can make all the difference in a child's life.

When I was a kid, my parents always told me what to do. They never gave me the chance to make my own decisions and learn from my mistakes. As a result, I often rebelled and made poor choices in my teen years.
Now that I'm a parent, I realize the importance of raising kids with a sense of independence and responsibility. That's where authoritative parenting comes in.
According to psychologists, authoritative parenting is a style of child-rearing that involves setting clear boundaries and rules while also maintaining open communication and nurturing relationships with your children. It's often described as a middle ground between authoritarian (strict and controlling) and permissive (lax and indulgent) parenting styles.

"2023-06-03 12:26 PM;","Every parent has had those moments when they feel like they are failing. Parenting can be tough. But according to author and speaker Lucille Williams, nothing in parenting is impossible with God. Let's take a look at some of the ways in which parents can turn to God for support and guidance.
""Parenting is not for the faint-hearted, but it's not impossible either. When we depend on God's guidance and strength, we can be confident that we will make it through the challenges and enjoy the blessings of parenthood.""
- Lucille Williams
One of the most important ways in which parents can turn to God is through prayer and faith. When we are feeling overwhelmed or unsure of how to handle a situation, we can turn to God in prayer and ask for guidance. Faith also helps us to trust that God is with us every step of the way, even when things seem impossible.
Some practical ways to incorporate prayer and faith into your parenting include:

As we packed up our tired and happy kids at the end of the day, I realized that while our trip had gone smoothly, there were certainly things we could have done differently to make it even better. And so, I present to you my top dos and don'ts for taking your kids to Disneyland.
Make a plan for which rides and attractions you want to visit, and be prepared to adjust that plan depending on crowds, wait times, and your kids' moods. Download the Disneyland app to keep up-to-date on wait times and other information about the park.
Also, consider packing some snacks and water bottles to save money and make sure your kids are well-fed and hydrated throughout the day.
Before you even enter the park, have a conversation with your kids about what behavior is acceptable and what is not. Be clear about your expectations, and make consequences for misbehavior known. Remember to praise your kids for good behavior as well.

"2023-06-03 04:26 PM;","When I was seven years old, my family went on vacation to the beach. I was having a great time playing in the waves, but I got a little too close to a big wave and it knocked me off my feet. Suddenly, I was underwater and couldn't breathe. I panicked and started thrashing around, but that only made things worse. Luckily, my dad saw what was happening and came to my rescue. He pulled me out of the water and I coughed and sputtered until I caught my breath. It was a scary experience, but it taught me an important lesson about water safety.
According to the CDC, drowning is the fifth leading cause of unintentional injury death in the United States, and the second leading cause of death for children ages 1 to 14.

"2023-06-03 04:26 PM;","When I was seven years old, my family went on vacation to the beach. I was having a great time playing in the waves, but I got a little too close to a big wave and it knocked me off my feet. Suddenly, I was underwater and couldn't breathe. I panicked and started thrashing around, but that only made things worse. Luckily, my dad saw what was happening and came to my rescue. He pulled me out of the water and I coughed and sputtered until I caught my breath. It was a scary experience, but it taught me an important lesson about water safety.

"2023-06-03 06:26 PM;","Imagine it's Monday morning and your teenage daughter wakes up late for school yet again. She had stayed up until the early hours of the morning studying for a test, but forgotten to set her alarm. Rushing to get ready, she forgets her lunch and leaves her phone at home. On the bus ride to school, she realizes she left her homework on her desk. All the while, she's feeling overwhelmed and anxious about the day ahead.

For teenagers with ADHD, mornings like this are not uncommon. The challenges they face are rooted in deficits in executive functioning skills. These skills are the building blocks for managing time, organizing and prioritizing tasks, setting goals and achieving them, and regulating emotions and behavior. They are what allow us to process information and make informed decisions. Without these skills, even simple tasks like getting dressed in the morning can be incredibly difficult.

"2023-06-03 08:26 PM;","As a parent, you want the best for your child. You want them to grow up to be happy, healthy, and successful. But how do you achieve that? What is the best way to raise a child?
There are many different parenting styles out there, but one that is gaining popularity among experts is authoritative parenting. This approach combines warmth and support with firm boundaries and expectations. It allows for freedom and independence while still providing guidance and structure.
Let's explore what authoritative parenting is, some techniques you can use, and how to discipline your child effectively.
Authoritative parenting is a style of parenting that is characterized by high levels of responsiveness and demandingness. According to research, this style is associated with better outcomes for children, including higher academic achievement, better mental health, and fewer behavioral problems.
Authoritative parents are warm and supportive, but they also set clear expectations and boundaries. They listen to their children's needs and concerns, but they also hold them accountable for their actions.

"2023-06-03 10:26 PM;","It was an ordinary day at the hospital where I work as a pediatrician, until I was called to the emergency room to attend to a toddler who had been brought in by the police. The child was barely conscious, with bruises all over his body and signs of neglect. His parents were nowhere to be found. When we ran some tests, we discovered that the child had been exposed to methamphetamine.
This situation is becoming all too common in the United States, as more and more states legalize drugs that were once considered illegal. While some argue that drug legalization can help reduce drug-related crimes and promote a more just society, the reality is that it's putting children at greater risk of abuse and addiction.
Drug addiction has been linked to a greater risk of child abuse and neglect. In 2016, there were approximately 676,000 children in the United States who were found to be victims of abuse or neglect, with drug use being a factor in 31% of all cases.
Child abuse can take many forms, including physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect. Children who are exposed to drug use and addiction are at a higher risk of all of these forms of abuse.
Drug addiction also affects a parent's ability to provide care for their children. They may prioritize their addiction over their children's basic needs, such as food, shelter, and medical care. They may also expose their children to dangerous situations, such as drug dealing or violence.

"2023-06-04 12:26 AM;","A recent photo of Jennifer Garner taking one of Jennifer Lopez's kids to Disneyland has been making waves on social media. The picture is a testament to the increasing trend of blended families, where parents and step-parents work together for the benefit of the children. Garner and Lopez, who were married to Ben Affleck at different times, have shown that co-parenting can be a positive experience for everyone involved.
Blended families are on the rise, with over 40% of marriages in the United States resulting in stepfamilies. As a result, co-parenting has become more important than ever before. It can be a challenging experience, but with the right approach, it can benefit everyone involved. Here are some quantifiable examples of how co-parenting can work:
When parents work together, children benefit from a more stable and supportive environment. This can lead to better emotional health, as children feel more secure and loved by both parents. Studies have shown that children with involved fathers are less likely to develop behavioral problems, depression, and anxiety. Co-parenting can also help children to develop better social skills, by providing them with opportunities to interact with a wider range of people.
Co-parenting can also have financial benefits for both parents. By working together, parents can save money on childcare and share the costs of raising children. This can be especially beneficial in cases where one parent is the primary earner and the other is a stay-at-home parent. Co-parenting can help to reduce financial stress, making it easier to provide for the children's needs.
When parents work together, they can provide positive role models for their children. By modeling cooperation and compromise, parents can teach their children important life skills. This can help children to develop better problem-solving and conflict resolution skills. It can also help them to develop more positive attitudes towards relationships, which can benefit them in the long run.

During his time behind bars, Lawton made the decision to turn his life around and become a better person. Today, he's a reformed criminal who has dedicated his life to helping others make better choices.
In 2023, Lawton will be hosting a parenting seminar to teach parents how to raise their children to become responsible, successful adults. The seminar will focus on practical strategies that parents can use to help their children avoid the mistakes that Lawton made in his own life.
The seminar will feature a number of quantifiable examples to help parents understand the impact that their parenting choices can have on their children's future. For example:
The title of the parenting seminar is ""Raising Responsible Kids in an Irresponsible World"". The title is eye-catching because it highlights a common problem that many parents face: how to teach their children to be responsible in a world that often seems to reward irresponsibility.
Lawton will be sharing his personal story during the seminar to illustrate the importance of making the right choices in life. He will also be sharing case studies of other people who have overcome significant obstacles to become successful in their own right. These stories will be used to help parents understand the power of positive role models and the impact that they can have on their children's lives.

"2023-06-04 04:26 AM;","Do you remember the time when you were a teenager and wanted to try out new things, but your parents wouldn't let you? Or perhaps you recall when your sibling got into trouble for not following the rules, but you were treated differently when you did the same thing? These are examples of inconsistent parenting, which can lead to confusion and resentment in children. On the other hand, there is a parenting style that balances firmness and warmth, structure and flexibility, and high expectations and support. It's called authoritative parenting, and it can benefit both parents and children.
According to a study by the University of California, Berkeley, authoritative parents tend to raise children who are independent, self-reliant, socially responsible, and academically successful. This is because authoritative parenting involves clear communication, mutual respect, negotiation, and monitoring. Unlike authoritarian parenting, which is strict and punitive, or permissive parenting, which is lax and indulgent, authoritative parenting seeks to create a positive environment where children can learn from their mistakes, develop their skills, and express themselves.
How can you practice authoritative parenting in your own family? Here are some techniques to consider:
Discipline is an integral part of authoritative parenting, but it's not synonymous with punishment. Instead, discipline means teaching children how to behave appropriately, and guiding them to learn from their mistakes. Here are some principles of discipline in authoritative parenting:
In conclusion, authoritative parenting is a style that balances warmth and discipline, and seeks to create a positive and supportive environment for children. By practicing authoritative parenting, you can raise resilient and responsible children who are capable of navigating challenges and succeeding in life. Here are three key takeaway points:
