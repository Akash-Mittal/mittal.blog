"2023-05-28 12:25 PM;","It was a scorching afternoon in Sudar, a small village in Sudan, when Fatima Ali, a mother of five, received the news that changed her life forever. She was informed that her husband, who had gone to the market to sell his goods, was killed in a crossfire between rival groups. She was devastated. Her husband was the only breadwinner of their family. She could not imagine how she would provide for her children without him.

Sadly, Fatima's story is not unique. Thousands of families in Sudan are facing similar challenges due to the ongoing conflict in the country. The situation has led to a humanitarian crisis that is affecting millions of people. According to ReliefWeb's Sudan Conflict Situation Report (3 May 2023), about 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, including food, shelter, and medical care.
