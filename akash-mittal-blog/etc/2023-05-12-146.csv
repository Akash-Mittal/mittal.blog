"2023-05-24 02:25 PM;","When Sarah's 10-year-old daughter asked if she could have a sleepover at her friend's house, Sarah's initial response was, ""No way."" Sarah had always been wary of sleepovers, citing concerns about safety, lack of sleep, and unsupervised activities.
However, when Sarah voiced her concerns to other parents, she found herself in the midst of a heated debate. Some parents shared her concerns and never allowed their children to go to sleepovers, while others saw sleepovers as a fun and harmless part of childhood.
According to a survey conducted by the website Parenting Today, 31% of parents never allow their children to attend sleepovers. Of those who do allow sleepovers, 31% set strict rules and guidelines for their children to follow.
However, despite these concerns, sleepovers continue to be a popular pastime for children. In fact, a survey by the UK website Netmums found that sleepovers were the second most popular activity for children aged 8-16, coming in just behind going to the cinema.
There are a number of reasons why parents choose to say no to sleepovers:
