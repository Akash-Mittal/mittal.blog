   <p>Imagine this: You're looking for a video tutorial on how to fix your broken laptop screen. You type your query on YouTube's search bar, and voila! A video with the most detailed step-by-step guide appears. But wait, there's more - right below the video, a chatbot pops up and asks if you need further assistance.</p>
   <p>That chatbot is not your typical robot programmed to give generic responses. It's powered by ChatGPT, an AI language model designed for conversational purposes. And the purpose of this collaboration between ChatGPT and YouTube is to enhance the user experience.</p>
   <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
   <p>ChatGPT's integration began as an experiment with selected tech channels on YouTube, such as Marques Brownlee and Unbox Therapy. The goal was to improve their viewers' learning experience and engagement. Instead of asking questions in the comment section and waiting for a response, viewers can now interact with the chatbot in real-time and receive relevant answers.</p>
   <p>This initiative has inspired other YouTube creators to follow suit. One such example is a cooking channel, Binging with Babish, where ChatGPT's chatbot answers questions that viewers might have about a recipe or ingredient. It's like having a virtual chef assistant!</p>
   <h2>Main Companies</h2>
   <p>The leading companies behind this collaboration are:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>: the world's largest video-sharing platform owned by Google LLC.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/turingcompltd/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a>: a conversational AI language model developed by Turing.com.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.google.com/">Google LLC</a>: the multinational technology company that owns YouTube.</li>
   </ul>
