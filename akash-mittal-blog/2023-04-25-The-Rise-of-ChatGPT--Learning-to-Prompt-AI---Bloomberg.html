   <p>Imagine you wake up one morning wanting to know what the weather is like for the day. You pick up your phone and instead of looking up the weather forecast, you ask your virtual assistant to do it for you. The virtual assistant understands and responds accordingly. You think to yourself, how did this happen?</p>
   <p>Well, the answer is simple. Artificial intelligence (AI) has made a tremendous impact on the way we interact with technology. One of the latest examples is ChatGPT, OpenAI's language model that can be prompted to answer questions.</p>
   <p>ChatGPT has taken the internet by storm, and it's only going to get more popular. But with this rise comes the need for us to learn how to prompt AI.</p>
   <h2>Concrete Examples</h2>
   <p>Let's say you're a business owner who wants to improve customer service through a chatbot. With ChatGPT, you can train your chatbot to understand common customer inquiries and respond automatically. This means your business can operate 24/7, with no human intervention required.</p>
   <p>Another example is in the medical field. With ChatGPT, doctors and nurses can quickly answer patient inquiries and provide medical advice. This can drastically reduce wait times and improve patient outcomes.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>As AI continues to advance, ChatGPT will become more prevalent in our daily lives.</li>
    <li>We need to learn how to prompt AI to maximize its potential benefits.</li>
    <li>By doing so, we can improve customer service, save time and money, and improve overall efficiency.</li>
   </ol>
