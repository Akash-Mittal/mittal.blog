   <h3>5 Co-Parenting Gems</h3>
   <p>Here are five co-parenting gems that Sarah and Tom learned during their therapy sessions.</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Put your children first. This may seem obvious, but it's important to remind yourself that your children's needs come before your own. When making decisions about co-parenting, think about what's best for your children, not what's easiest for you or your ex.</li>
    <li>Communicate in a civil manner. While it may be difficult at times, try to communicate with your ex in a civil manner. Avoid name-calling, blaming, or shaming. Stick to the facts and keep the conversation focused on your children.</li>
    <li>Be flexible. Co-parenting requires flexibility. Things will come up, schedules will change, and unexpected events will occur. Try to be open to changes and willing to adapt.</li>
    <li>Respect boundaries. It's important to establish boundaries with your ex and respect them. This can include things like not calling or texting late at night, avoiding talking about your personal lives, and not criticizing each other's parenting styles.</li>
    <li>Seek professional help if needed. Sometimes co-parenting can be difficult, despite your best efforts. If you're struggling, don't hesitate to seek professional help. A therapist or mediator can help you and your ex work through any issues and find solutions that work for everyone.</li>
   </ol>
