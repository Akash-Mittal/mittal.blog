   <p>It happened in early 2023. A group of old friends gathered at a coffee shop, hugging each other like they had not seen each other for ages. The truth was, they had not seen each other for almost two years. The pandemic had pulled them apart, and they had lived their lives through screens.</p>
   <p>As they sat down, sipping on their coffee, they realized – the digital age has changed us. We have become more isolated, more disconnected. The fear of missing out had turned into the fear of socializing. People had started preferring digital chats over face-to-face conversations. It was convenient, but it was not fulfilling.</p>
   <p>That day, they realized – they needed real-life connections in their lives. They needed to be surrounded by people. They needed the sense of community, belongingness, and socializing. They needed to feel alive.</p>
   <p>The world had changed, but it was time to take a step back, re-discover ourselves, and walk into the new world with the strength of our connections.</p>
   <h2>Example</h2>
   <p>The pandemic made us realize the importance of online connections. However, it also showed us the drawbacks. People faced loneliness, anxiety, depression, and the feeling of hopelessness. The reason? Lack of real-life connections. It was when we could not hug our friends or kiss our partners that we realized the significance of physical touch, the warmth of a smile, and the thrill of venturing out.</p>
   <p>The pandemic has made us more cautious, but it has also made us more vulnerable. It was when we searched for that human connection behind the screen that we realized – life is best lived in the moment. It was when we craved for the smell of freshly brewed coffee or the sound of laughter, that we realized – IRL is back.</p>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p class="conclusion">In conclusion, the return of face-to-face interactions marks an exciting milestone in our cultural evolution. Here are three points that signify the importance of IRL:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Real-life connections give us a sense of belongingness and community- something every human being craves for.</li>
    <li>We need to break out of our isolated digital world and discover the thrill of face-to-face conversations to understand ourselves better.</li>
    <li>The pandemic has taught us the importance of human touch and the value of the simple pleasures of life that we take for granted.</li>
   </ol>
