    <h2>Starting with a Story</h2>
    <p>Meet Lila, a 10-year-old student from Cameroon. She attends a rural school in her village, where resources are limited, and there are no trained teachers for advanced subjects. However, Lila is passionate about science and dreams of becoming a doctor someday. Unfortunately, due to the lack of resources, her school cannot provide her with the necessary guidance and exposure to help her achieve her goals.</p>
    <p>This is just one of the many stories of students in developing countries who are struggling to receive quality education. However, with technology advancing at lightning speed, there is hope in providing quality education to all students, regardless of their geographic location or socioeconomic status, through AI in classrooms.</p>

   <section>
    <h2>UNESCO's New Roadmap for AI in Classrooms</h2>
    <p>UNESCO has recently unveiled a new roadmap for AI in classrooms, which aims to guide educational institutions globally on how to incorporate AI in their teaching methodologies and improve students' learning experiences.</p>
    <p>The roadmap comprises of four key areas:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Policy and governance</li>
     <li>Cross-cutting issues</li>
     <li>Curriculum and content development</li>
     <li>Research and development</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The policy and governance area primarily focuses on the ethical, legal and social implications of AI in classrooms. Educational institutions need to ensure that their policies and practices align with international ethical, legal and human rights frameworks while incorporating AI in classrooms.</p>
    <p>Cross-cutting issues area includes accessibility and inclusion, teacher training, and quality assurance of AI systems. It highlights the significance of inclusivity and accessibility of AI in classrooms for students with disabilities, special educational needs, and students from marginalized communities.</p>
    <p>The curriculum and content development area emphasizes the role of AI in transforming the learning experience of students. Educational institutions need to incorporate AI in their curriculums and content development to provide students with relevant and innovative learning opportunities.</p>
    <p>The research and development area advocates for research in the development and implementation of AI in classrooms to enhance its effectiveness and sustainability.</p>
   </section><!--Quantifiable Examples-->
   <section>
    
    <p>The implementation of AI in classrooms has already shown promising results. For instance, the US-based startup, Squirrel AI Learning, has developed an AI platform that personalizes education based on each student's learning style, making education more efficient and effective.</p>
    <p>In another example, the National University of Singapore has collaborated with a local AI software company to develop an AI interactive learning platform for primary school students. The platform allows students to practice language, mathematics, and critical thinking skills and provides real-time feedback to students to enhance their learning experience.</p>
    <p>AI has also enabled the automation of certain processes that traditionally require human effort, thereby saving valuable resources. For instance, AI-enabled grading systems can grade essays and assignments quickly and efficiently without requiring the presence of a human grader.</p>
   </section><!--Case Studies-->
   <section>
    <h2>Case Studies</h2>
    <p>Nepal is a country that has been severely affected by a shortage of teachers and educational resources. To address this issue, the Nepalese government has partnered with UNICEF and private organizations to develop an AI-powered chatbot called ‘AskNepal', which provides personalized educational assistance and guidance to students.</p>
    <p>In India, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has introduced AI in the teaching methodologies of various subjects, including mathematics and science, to enhance the learning experience of students. The CBSE has collaborated with IBM Watson, a leading AI software company, to provide AI-enabled study materials and evaluation systems to students.</p>
    <p>However, it is essential to note that the implementation of AI in classrooms has its challenges. One of the significant issues is the lack of skilled professionals who can develop and maintain AI systems for educational institutions. Educational institutions, especially those in developing countries, need to invest in training their teachers and staff to develop the necessary skillsets.</p>
   </section><!--Conclusion-->
   <section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>AI in classrooms can enhance students' learning experiences, providing students with personalized and innovative learning opportunities, regardless of their geographic location or socioeconomic status.</li>
     <li>Educational institutions need to incorporate AI in their curriculums, policies, and practices to provide students with quality education while ensuring ethical, legal, and social implications of AI in classrooms are adhered to.</li>
     <li>The implementation of AI in classrooms has its challenges, such as the lack of skilled professionals and required resources in educational institutions. Therefore, investment in training teachers, developing necessary skillsets, and collaboration between public and private sectors is essential to address these challenges.</li>
