Online Questions Better Than Real Doctors â?? A Research Study+">
   <p>As a medical professional, I was always skeptical about how artificial intelligence and chatbots can replace real human interaction in healthcare. However, a recent incident changed my perspective completely.</p>
   <p>One of my patients, Marie, had been reporting symptoms of fatigue, muscle pain, and headaches for the past few weeks. Despite a thorough physical examination and multiple labs, I could not find any definitive diagnosis.</p>
   <p>Marie then turned to a health chatbot called Ada that she found online. After answering its questions, Ada suggested a diagnosis of Lyme disease, which I had not previously considered. Sure enough, further testing confirmed the diagnosis, and Marie started treatment:</p>
   <blockquote>
    â??Iâ??m so grateful for Ada â?? as soon as I entered my symptoms it felt like talking to a real doctor â?? but better because it asked me questions that a real doctor might not have known to ask. I would honestly recommend this app to anyone who feels that they arenâ??t getting the answers they need from traditional doctors.â?? - Marie
   </blockquote>
   <p>Marieâ??s experience is not an isolated incident. A recent study by Accenture found that over half of patients prefer the use of chatbots to manage their health. The reason for this shift is not far-stretched. Patients can receive immediate and personalized attention without an appointment, saving both time and money. They can also avoid the â??white-coat syndromeâ?? and talk more openly about their symptoms.</p>
   <p>In light of these changes, companies like Babylon Health and Your.MD have arisen on the scene. These companies utilize artificial intelligence to help people manage their health in a more efficient and effective manner. Babylon Health, for example, utilizes chatbots to â??treat common illnesses, order prescriptions, and even book appointments.â?? Your.MD also uses conversational AI to help patients diagnose their own symptoms and refer them to appropriate healthcare services.</p>
   <p>The benefits of these companies are not only seen in diagnosis and treatment but also in public health. For example, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, chatbots became an invaluable tool for disseminating credible information and advice to users, helping to reduce the spread and panic of the virus.</p>
