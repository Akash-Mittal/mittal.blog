   <p>Once upon a time, there was a man named Jack Ma who founded a company called Alibaba. Today, Alibaba is not just an e-commerce giant, but a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning as well. This week, Alibaba unveiled its latest AI model, called ChatGPT-like Tongyi Qianwen AI, to compete with Baidu's Ernie.</p>
   <p>Alibaba's ChatGPT-like model is designed to understand human language and respond to questions in a natural way, making conversational AI more human-like. It can be used in chatbots, virtual assistants, customer service, and other applications.</p>
   <p>This is not the first time that Alibaba has made headlines in the AI race. In 2017, Alibaba's AI beat humans in a reading comprehension test. And last year, Alibaba's AI-powered healthcare platform, called ET Medical Brain, helped doctors diagnose brain tumors with 90% accuracy.</p>
