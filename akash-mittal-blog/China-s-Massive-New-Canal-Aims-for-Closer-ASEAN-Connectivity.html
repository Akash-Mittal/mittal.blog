    <h3 class="section-title">An Interesting Story</h3>
    <p>When Li Min, a 33-year-old businesswoman from Guangzhou, first heard about China's plan to build a massive canal to connect the Yangtze River to the Pearl River, she was skeptical. "I couldn't imagine how it would work," she said. "But when I saw the government's detailed plan, I realized it could be a game-changer for our company."</p>
    <p>Li's company, which exports electronic goods to Southeast Asia, currently relies on trucks and ships to transport the goods from Guangzhou to the ASEAN region. The new canal could cut the travel time and costs significantly.</p>

    <h3 class="section-title">Quantifiable Examples</h3>
    <p>The new canal is expected to be around 1,200 km long and will cost an estimated 1.15 billion yuan (USD 170 billion) to build. It will connect the cities of Yangzhou, Nanjing, Wuhu, and Jiujiang in the Yangtze River to the cities of Huizhou and Shenzhen in the Pearl River delta.</p>
    <p>The canal will reduce the shipping time from Shanghai to the ASEAN region by around 7 days, from the current 15-20 days. The cost of shipping through the canal will be around 30% lower than the cost of shipping through the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>According to a report by the China-ASEAN Business Council, the new canal could increase trade between China and the ASEAN region by around 30%, from the current USD 587 billion to USD 760 billion.</p>

    <h3 class="section-title"> and Case Studies</h3>
    <p>Li Min's company is not the only one that stands to benefit from the new canal. Many businesses in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area are also excited about the project.</p>
    <p>Wang Yang, the Vice Premier of China, said in a recent speech that the new canal would be "a key part of the country's new infrastructure plan". He also emphasized the need for the government and the private sector to work together to make the project a success.</p>
    <p>However, there are concerns about the potential impact of the new canal on the environment and the livelihoods of people living in the surrounding areas. The government has promised to address these concerns and mitigate any negative effects of the project.</p>
