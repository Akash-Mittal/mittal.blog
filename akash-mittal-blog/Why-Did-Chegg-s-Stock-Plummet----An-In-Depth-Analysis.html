   <p>It was just another day when Chegg, an American education technology company, witnessed a sudden drop in its stock price. It was the kind of situation that many investors dread â?? a stock plummeting without any warning.</p>
   <p>What happened next was a nail-biting experience for the investors and Chegg's management team as well. The company's stock price tanked by more than 18%, and the market cap plummeted by over $1 billion.</p>
   <h2>What Went Wrong?</h2>
   <p>The sudden dip in the stock price was attributed to ChatGPT, a startup that gained prominence for providing free online tutoring services. ChatGPT's idea was simple â?? connect students with subject matter experts (SMEs) in real-time.</p>
   <p>The company relied on an AI-based technology that could predict what a student wanted to learn by analyzing their previous queries. It allowed the company to connect students with the right SMEs in seconds.</p>
   <p>Chegg's management team was well aware of ChatGPT's existence, but they never considered it to be a significant threat. However, the sudden loss of over 20% of the projected revenue in the next quarter came as a shock to them.</p>
   <p>ChatGPT was gaining traction in the education industry and was becoming a go-to platform for students who wanted personalized assistance at affordable rates.</p>
   <h2>Real-life Examples</h2>
   <p>The story of Chegg and ChatGPT is not unique. It's a classic example of how fast a market can change and how startups can disrupt established businesses. Uber disrupted the taxi industry, Airbnb disrupted the hotel industry, and now ChatGPT is disrupting the online tutoring industry.</p>
   <p>Another example is Kodak, a company that failed to recognize the potential of digital photography and went bankrupt. The digital revolution was taking over the photography industry, and Kodak's management team failed to see that.</p>
   <h2>What Can We Learn From This?</h2>
   <p>There are a few key lessons that we can learn from the Chegg-ChatGPT debacle:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Pay attention to the competition, even if they seem small</li>
    <li>Don't dismiss new technology or business models</li>
    <li>Be prepared to adapt to changes in the market</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>Chegg's stock plummeted because the company failed to recognize a potential disruptor in the market. The lesson to be learned here is that no business is too big to fail, and innovation can come from unexpected places.</p>
