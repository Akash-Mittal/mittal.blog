   <p>It was a sunny day when I met her at the park. She had a daughter the same age as mine, and we hit it off instantly. For the first time in a long time, I felt like I had a friend who understood the challenges of motherhood. We exchanged phone numbers and made plans to have a playdate the following week.</p>
   <p>But that playdate never happened. A few days later, I received a text from her, saying that she had heard about my divorce and that she didn't want her daughter around "that kind of negativity." That was the beginning of the end of my search for mom friends.</p>
   <h2>The Importance of Mom Friends</h2>
   <p>As a divorced mom, I quickly realized how important it was to have a support system. I needed someone to vent to, someone to laugh with, and someone to share the joys and struggles of motherhood with. But finding mom friends wasn't as easy as I thought it would be.</p>
   <p>I tried going to local mom groups and meetups, but I always felt like an outsider. The other moms seemed to have known each other for years, and I felt like I was intruding. I tried talking to other moms at my kids' school, but most of them seemed to be more interested in gossiping than in forming genuine friendships.</p>
   <h2>Why I Decided to Give Up</h2>
   <p>After numerous failed attempts at finding mom friends, I came to the realization that maybe it just wasn't meant to be. Instead of wasting energy and time on something that wasn't working, I decided to focus on what really mattered: my kids.</p>
   <p>I started to attend more of their school events and extracurricular activities, and I began to build relationships with other parents who shared my passion for being involved in their children's lives. I also found solace in online parenting communities, where I could connect with other moms who were going through similar struggles.</p>
   <h2>The Benefits of Focusing on My Kids</h2>
   <p>Since giving up on the quest for mom friends, I've noticed a shift in my priorities. Instead of worrying about fitting in with a certain group of moms, I'm more focused on what my kids need. I've become more present and attentive, and I've started to appreciate the moments I have with my children even more.</p>
   <p>Here are three reasons why I believe that focusing on my kids has been the best decision I could have made:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>My kids are happier. Instead of feeling like they have to compete for my attention, they know that they are my top priority.</li>
    <li>I am happier. I don't feel the pressure to conform to a certain social norm, and I'm not constantly worrying about what other moms think of me.</li>
    <li>I am setting a good example. By focusing on my children and their needs, I am showing them that family comes first and that they can always count on me to be there for them.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>While it would have been nice to have found a group of mom friends who understood my struggles, I don't feel like I'm missing out anymore. By focusing on what really matters - my kids - I've been able to cultivate a deeper relationship with them and create lasting memories. And who knows, maybe I'll stumble upon a group of like-minded moms in the future. But for now, I'm content with the bond that I have with my children.</p>
