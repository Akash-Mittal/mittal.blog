  <p></p>
  <p>It was a typical day for xQc, one of the biggest names in Twitch streaming. He was busy playing a game and chatting with his audience when he accidentally leaked his ChatGPT history. But it was not just any history, it contained discussions about his potential signing with Kick, a leading brand in esports apparel and accessories.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>While the leak may have caused a stir among his fans and haters alike, it also shed light on the world of esports sponsorships and brand deals. How do top streamers like xQc land these deals and what does it mean for their careers? Let's take a deep dive into the art of signing with brands in esports.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Quantifiable Examples of Brand Deals in Esports</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In 2020, esports market revenue reached $1.1 billion, with sponsorships and advertising accounting for almost half of that amount. This shows the immense potential for esports athletes and streamers to earn big bucks through brand deals. A few examples of top brand deals with esports personalities include:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>- Ninja's highly publicized deal with Adidas in 2019, reportedly worth up to $40 million for 4 years</p>
  <p>- Shroud's collaboration with Logitech G, which resulted in the development of his own line of gaming peripherals</p>
  <p>- PewDiePie's partnership with G Fuel, a popular energy drink among gamers, which reportedly earned him $2.5 million</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>These examples show that brand deals in esports are not only lucrative but also strategic for both parties. Top companies are eager to partner with esports personalities because they have a loyal and engaged fan base, while the athletes and streamers benefit from the financial rewards and exposure.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Key Points to Consider When Signing with Brands</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Based on xQc's leak and other similar instances in the past, it's evident that signing with a brand is not a straightforward process. Here are three key points to consider when you're looking to land a brand deal:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>1. Stay Authentic to your Personal Brand</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>As an esports personality, your personal brand is your most valuable asset, and it's crucial to maintain authenticity when signing with a brand. You don't want to endorse a product or service that doesn't align with your beliefs or values, as it will result in a loss of credibility among your followers. Instead, focus on partnering with brands that complement your brand and add value to your content.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>2. Negotiate Fair Terms and Compensation</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>It's easy to get swayed by the potential financial rewards of a brand deal, but it's crucial to negotiate fair terms and compensation. This includes understanding the length of the contract, the scope of the partnership, the obligations of both parties, and the payment structure. Don't hesitate to seek legal counsel if necessary, and ensure that you're getting the best possible deal for your services.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>3. Be Transparent with your Audience</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Esports fans are a discerning bunch, and they value transparency and honesty from their favorite personalities. When you're signing with a brand, it's essential to disclose the nature of the partnership to your audience. Be clear about the products or services you're promoting, and avoid any language or actions that suggest you're selling out. If your fans feel like you're being authentic and transparent, they'll be more likely to support you and the brand you're promoting.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Personal Anecdotes and Practical Tips</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>As a successful esports personality, I've learned a few lessons about signing with brands that I'd like to share. First and foremost, it's crucial to understand your brand and what sets it apart from others in the market. This will help you identify brands that align with your values and resonate with your audience.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Secondly, when you're negotiating terms and compensation with a brand, don't be afraid to ask for what you deserve. You're offering a valuable service to the brand, and you deserve to be compensated fairly.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Lastly, always be transparent with your audience, and explain the nature of your partnership in a clear and honest manner. This will help you maintain the trust and loyalty of your fans, which is essential for long-term success in esports.</p>
