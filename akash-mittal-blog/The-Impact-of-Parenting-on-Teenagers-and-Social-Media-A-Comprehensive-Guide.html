  <p>It was 10 PM on a school night and 15-year-old Emily was still glued to her phone, scrolling through her Facebook feed. As her mother walked into the room, she saw Emily's tired eyes and knew that something had to change.</p>
  <p>This scenario is becoming increasingly common as teenagers today spend more and more time on social media. As parents, it's our responsibility to guide our children towards responsible use of technology and social media. But, how much of an impact does parenting have on how social media affects our teenagers? Let's take a closer look.</p>
  <h2>The Impact of Parenting on Social Media Use</h2>
  <p>Studies have shown that parents play a crucial role in shaping how their teenagers use social media. According to a report by Common Sense Media, "parents who set rules and place limits on their child's use of media are more likely to have positive outcomes for their children's media use, including social and emotional well-being." The report also found that "parental engagement in children's media use is associated with lower levels of risky media behavior."</p>
  <p>Let's look at some quantifiable examples of the impact of parenting on social media use:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Teens who report having rules about social media use are less likely to experience cyberbullying.</li>
   <li>Parental mediation of social media use has been linked to lower rates of depression and anxiety in teenagers.</li>
   <li>Teens whose parents monitor their online activity are less likely to share personal information or engage in risky behaviors online.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Practical Tips for Parents</h2>
  <p>So, how can parents take an active role in shaping their teenager's social media use? Here are some practical tips:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Set clear rules and limits for social media use, such as time limits and no phones at the dinner table.</li>
   <li>Monitor your teenager's online activity, including their friends and the content they are viewing and sharing.</li>
   <li>Talk to your teenager about appropriate online behavior and the consequences of engaging in risky activities online.</li>
   <li>Encourage your teenager to use social media to connect with positive role models and engage in meaningful conversations.</li>
   <li>Lead by example and model responsible social media use yourself.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, it's clear that parenting plays a significant role in how social media impacts teenagers. By setting clear rules and limits, monitoring online activity, and having open communication with our teenagers, we can help ensure that social media is a positive force in their lives. Remember, it's never too late to start taking an active role in your teenager's social media use.</p>
