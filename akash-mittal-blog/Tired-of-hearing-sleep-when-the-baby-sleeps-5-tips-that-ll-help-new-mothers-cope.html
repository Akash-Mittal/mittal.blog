  <p>Being a new mother can be overwhelming. There's so much to do and so little time. You're constantly on the go, juggling household chores, taking care of your baby, and managing relationships with family and friends. And to top it off, everyone around you seems to have advice on what you should or shouldn't be doing.</p>
  <p>One piece of advice that new mothers hear all the time is "sleep when the baby sleeps." While this may be good advice in theory, it's not always practical. Here are five tips that'll help you cope with the challenges of being a new mother:</p>
  <h2>Tip 1: Get help from friends and family</h2>
  <p>You don't have to do everything by yourself. It's okay to ask for help. Call on your friends and family to help you with household chores, cooking, and running errands. Having someone to share the load with can make a big difference.</p>
  <p>If you don't have family nearby, consider hiring a babysitter or a mother's helper. They can help you take care of your baby while you take a nap or do something for yourself.</p>
  <h2>Tip 2: Take care of yourself</h2>
  <p>It's easy to get caught up in taking care of your baby and forget about your own needs. But taking care of yourself is just as important. Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating healthy, and staying hydrated.</p>
  <p>You can also try relaxation techniques like meditation and yoga to help you manage stress and anxiety.</p>
  <h2>Tip 3: Create a schedule</h2>
  <p>Create a schedule for you and your baby. This will help you establish a routine and make sure you're both getting enough sleep and rest. Stick to your schedule as much as possible, but be flexible when necessary.</p>
  <p>Having a schedule can also help you plan your day and make time for yourself. You can schedule time for exercise, meeting friends, or pursuing a hobby.</p>
  <h2>Tip 4: Use technology to your advantage</h2>
  <p>There are many apps and tools available that can help you manage your time and take care of your baby. You can use a baby monitor to keep an eye on your baby while you're in another room, or a breastfeeding app to track your baby's feedings and diaper changes.</p>
  <p>You can also use a calendar app to schedule reminders and keep track of important appointments and events.</p>
  <h2>Tip 5: Join a support group</h2>
  <p>Joining a support group can be a great way to connect with other new mothers who are going through the same challenges as you. You can share your experiences, get advice, and find emotional support.</p>
  <p>There are many online support groups and forums available, as well as local groups that meet in person. Do some research to find a group that suits your needs.</p>
