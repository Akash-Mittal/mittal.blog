  <p>Apple Inc, the renowned tech-giant, has reportedly banned its employees from using the AI Chatbot app, ChatGPT on their iPhones. According to the sources, the app has been accused of being incompatible with the policies of the company and is deemed to be a threat to cybersecurity.</p>
  <h3>The Story Behind the App</h3>
  <p>ChatGPT, designed by a group of software developers, has been making rounds on various platforms for its fascinating technology. It is an AI-based chatbot application that uses natural language processing to interact with humans. It is a versatile tool that students use for learning, and professionals use for productivity.

  <p>ChatGPT was initially launched as a website in the year 2019, and it instantly grabbed the attention of thousands of users from all around the world.
