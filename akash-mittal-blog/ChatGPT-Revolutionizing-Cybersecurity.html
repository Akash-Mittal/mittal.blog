    <h3>Critical Comments</h3>
    <ol>
     <li>ChatGPT requires a high degree of technical expertise to implement and manage, which could make it inaccessible to smaller organizations.</li>
     <li>ChatGPT is only as good as the data that it has access to, which means that organizations need to be vigilant about keeping their systems up to date and collecting accurate information.</li>
     <li>ChatGPT is not a replacement for human intelligence and decision-making. It should be used in conjunction with other cybersecurity measures that involve human oversight and intervention.</li>
