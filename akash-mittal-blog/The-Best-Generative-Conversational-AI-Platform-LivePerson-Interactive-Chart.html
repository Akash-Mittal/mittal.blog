     <p>John was planning his vacation and was struggling to find the right flights and hotels. He decided to use a travel booking website that had LivePerson Interactive Chart installed.</p>
     <p>He was pleasantly surprised when a chatbot started a conversation with him asking if he needs help with his bookings, and he thought "This will be another dead end chat". However, the bot soon understood his criteria and started providing personalized recommendations that even his friends had not mentioned earlier. He was awestruck that a bot got him better deals than all his searching by himself. Not only that, there were a few customizations that the bot offered him to take care of his extra-picky demands.</p>
     <p>John was able to book all his travel arrangements in less than an hour, with the help of the bot. The best part? It felt like he was talking to a human travel agent, with all the friendly banter and personalized recommendations.</p>
