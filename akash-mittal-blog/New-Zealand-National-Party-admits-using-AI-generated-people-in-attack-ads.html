    <p>It was a typical election year in New Zealand, and political ads had started flooding the airwaves. However, something was different about the latest attack ads from the New Zealand National Party. Instead of using actors or stock footage, the ads featured AI-generated people.</p>
    <p>According to a statement released by the party, the decision to use AI-generated people was made to save time and money. "We wanted to get our message out there quickly and effectively, and using AI allowed us to create people who would resonate with our audience without having to go through the usual casting and filming processes."</p>
    <p>While the use of AI in advertising is not new, the use of AI-generated people in political attack ads raised concerns about the ethics of such practices.</p>
    
    <p>A survey conducted by the New Zealand Broadcasting Standards Authority found that 70% of respondents believed that the use of AI-generated people in political ads was unethical.</p>
    <p>Additionally, a study by the University of Canterbury found that AI-generated people were more effective at evoking emotional responses from viewers than real people. However, the same study found that viewers were less likely to trust AI-generated people than real people.</p>
    
    <p>As someone who has worked in the advertising industry for several years, I can attest to the fact that AI-generated people are becoming increasingly popular in advertising. However, I also believe that there is a line that should not be crossed when it comes to ethics.</p>
    <p>One of my colleagues worked on an ad campaign that used AI-generated people, and while the ad was effective, it did raise some concerns among the team. We discussed the implications of using AI-generated people in advertising and ultimately decided that it was not worth the risk of appearing unethical.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, the use of AI-generated people in political attack ads is a controversial practice that raises ethical concerns. While AI can save time and money in the advertising process, it is important to consider the implications of using AI-generated people and whether it is ethical to do so.</p>
    <p>Three key points to consider when it comes to the use of AI in advertising:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>AI-generated people can elicit strong emotional responses from viewers, but they may also be less trusted than real people.</li>
     <li>The use of AI-generated people in advertising can save time and money, but it is important to consider whether it is ethical to do so.</li>
     <li>As consumers become more savvy about the use of AI in advertising, companies will need to be transparent about their use of these technologies.</li>
