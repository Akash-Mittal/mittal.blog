   <p>Gemma McCaw, a well-known mother and former New Zealand hockey player, recently came under fire for a social media post in which she shared a photo of her daughter with the caption, "This child won't stop talking and I need earplugs ASAP." While many parents could relate to the sentiment, one person took issue with the comment and criticized McCaw for being a "bad parent" who "doesn't appreciate her child."</p>
   <p>Despite the hurtful words, McCaw refused to back down and instead clapped back at the critic with a thoughtful response.<br>
     "It's funny how people can make judgement calls on a tiny snippet of someone's life. I'm a human being, I have bad days and I also have great days. Just because I put a picture up on social media doesn't mean I'm less of a parent or love my child any less," she wrote.</p>
   <p>Much like McCaw, many parents face unwarranted criticism for their choices and actions, which can cause stress, anxiety, and self-doubt. However, rather than letting the negativity consume us, we can learn to clap back and stand our ground with confidence, respect, and self-assurance.</p>
   <h2>Some Quantifiable Examples</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>According to a survey by the American Psychological Association, more than 40% of parents have felt judged by others about their parenting skills.</li>
    <li>A study by the University of Michigan found that parents who feel criticized are more likely to experience symptoms of depression and anxiety.</li>
    <li>Research by the University of Waterloo revealed that negative feedback from others can contribute to parental stress and burnout.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>These statistics show that criticism of parenting is a widespread issue that can have serious implications for mental health and well-being. However, there are ways to combat the negativity and reclaim our confidence and sense of self-worth.</p>
   <h2>The Art of Clapping Back</h2>
   <p>Here are some tips for clapping back at criticism:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Stay Calm: It's easy to get defensive when faced with criticism, but reacting in anger or frustration can escalate the situation and make things worse. Instead, take a deep breath and try to remain calm and composed.</li>
    <li>Find Perspective: Remember that the person criticizing you is likely not an expert on parenting and is speaking from their own biases and experiences. Try to see their comments as a reflection of their own issues rather than a commentary on your abilities as a parent.</li>
    <li>Respond Respectfully: When responding to criticism, choose your words carefully and aim to be respectful and constructive. Avoid attacking the person or getting into a heated argument, as this will only fuel the negativity.</li>
    <li>Seek Support: Don't be afraid to reach out to friends, family, or a therapist for support and guidance when dealing with criticism. Talking through your feelings and concerns can help you gain perspective and find new ways to cope with the negativity.</li>
   </ul>
