   <p>Jason Kelce, the Philadelphia Eagles center, recently revealed his misconception about raising girls in an interview with SheKnows. As a proud father of two daughters, Kelce thought that he was doing everything right in terms of raising strong, confident girls. However, he soon realized that there were some things he had missed along the way.</p>
   <p>When Kelce's eldest daughter started playing sports, he was thrilled. He thought that he was setting a great example for her by encouraging her to be active and fearless. However, he soon noticed that she was struggling with self-confidence, especially in comparison to her male teammates. Kelce was puzzled by this, as he had always thought that he was raising his daughters to be strong and independent. It wasn't until he started talking to other parents and coaches that he realized his mistake.</p>
   <p>"I had this idea in my head that I was raising girls to be just like boys, because I thought that was the ultimate goal," Kelce said in the interview. "But it wasn't until I started talking to other parents and coaches that I realized that the goal isn't to be just like boys, it's to be the best versions of themselves."</p>
   
   <p>Kelce's experience is not unique. Many parents, especially dads, want to raise strong, confident girls who can take on the world. However, sometimes their idea of what that means can be misguided. Here are some quantifiable examples of how parents can unintentionally hold their daughters back:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Girls are less likely than boys to participate in sports or physical activities due to social stigma and lack of female role models.</li>
    <li>Girls are more likely than boys to be praised for their looks rather than their abilities, which can lead to anxiety, self-doubt, and body image issues.</li>
    <li>Girls are less likely than boys to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) due to lack of exposure and stereotypes.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2> and Practical Tips</h2>
   <p>In the interview, Kelce shared some personal anecdotes about his journey to becoming a better father to his daughters. He realized that it's not enough to simply encourage his daughters to be active and fearless. He needed to actively listen to them, support them, and let them be themselves.</p>
   <p>Here are some practical tips for parents who want to raise confident, empowered girls:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Encourage your daughter to participate in sports or physical activities, but also provide positive reinforcement for non-physical achievements.</li>
    <li>Focus on your daughter's abilities rather than her looks, and encourage her to pursue her interests and passions.</li>
    <li>Expose your daughter to careers in STEM and provide opportunities for her to explore her interests in those fields.</li>
    <li>Listen to your daughter's concerns and opinions, and support her decisions even if they don't align with your expectations.</li>
    <li>Teach your daughter about consent, healthy relationships, and gender equality from a young age.</li>
   </ul>
