   <p>It's a hot summer day in Mumbai and Nisha has just received a notification on her phone from one of her favorite online stores. They have a new sale going on and she can't resist the temptation to buy yet another dress. However, when she tries to make the payment, something goes wrong and her transaction fails. Frustrated, she clicks on the "Need Help?" option and is directed to a chatbot powered by ChatGPT.</p>
   <p>The chatbot greets her and asks how it can assist her. Nisha types her query and within seconds, the bot provides her with a solution. She's impressed by how quickly and efficiently her problem was solved and makes a mental note to use the same store in the future.</p>
   <p>This scenario is becoming increasingly common in India, with businesses across sectors adopting ChatGPT to improve customer service and engagement. ChatGPT is a chatbot platform that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to deliver personalized, human-like conversations with customers.</p>

   <p>One of the companies leading this trend is online grocery store, BigBasket. They use ChatGPT to handle customer queries and provide recommendations based on customer preferences. The chatbot has reduced response time by over 70%, resulting in higher customer satisfaction rates.</p>
   <p>Another company benefiting from ChatGPT is insurance provider, Acko. Their chatbot helps customers buy policies, renew them, and even make claims. They've seen a 30% increase in customer conversions since implementing ChatGPT.</p>
   <p>ChatGPT is also being used by banks like HDFC to provide account information, transaction history, and other financial services to their customers. The chatbot is available 24/7, making it convenient for customers to access their banking information anytime, anywhere.</p>
