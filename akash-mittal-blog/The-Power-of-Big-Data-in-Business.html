  <h1>The Power of Big Data in Business</h1> <img src="./images/The-Power-of-Big-Data-in-Business.jpeg" alt="+The Power of Big Data in Business+">
  <p>As the world becomes increasingly digital, the amount of data being generated is growing at an exceptional rate. In fact, according to IBM, as much as 90% of the data in existence today has been created in the last two years alone.</p>
  <p>This vast amount of data has given businesses of all sizes the opportunity to gain insights into customer behavior and industry trends like never before. With the ability to process and analyze huge amounts of data in real-time, big data has revolutionized the way businesses operate, and has brought with it a plethora of benefits.</p>
  <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
  <p>One company using big data to great effect is US-based retailer Walmart. They have developed a machine-learning algorithm that analyses customer data to determine which products should be stocked in each store and at what price. This has allowed Walmart to optimize their inventory, reduce wastage, and improve profitability.</p>
  <p>Another example is the online streaming service Netflix. They use big data to provide customized recommendations to users based on their viewing history and preferences. This has resulted in users watching more content and staying subscribed for longer periods of time.</p>
